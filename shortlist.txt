Bad weather is largely responsible for some recent weak economic data and should not lead the Federal Reserve to stop reducing a key stimulus program, a top central bank official said Monday.
Instead, with economic growth still forecast to pick up this year, the Fed might need to quicken the pullback of its monthly bond-buying program, said Charles Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
"In recent weeks, there has been a blizzard of economic reports, which have come in weaker than expected," Plosser said in a speech in Paris.

"I believe that weakness largely reflects the severe winter weather rather than a frozen recovery," he said. "So, we must be wary of attaching too much significance to the latest numbers."
Concerns about a slowdown eased Friday when the Labor Department reported stronger than expected job growth in February. The report confirmed the belief that snow and bitter cold in much of the country were the main reason for some weak economic data and that growth would improve in the spring.
Plosser, a voting member of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, is a so-called inflation hawk. He has opposed the Fed's bond-buying program, which began in September 2012 with purchases of $85 billion a month, out of concerns it could trigger higher prices.
So far, however, inflation has remained in check.
After the speech, Plosser told reporters that the Fed should stick to the plan announced in December of reducing the monthly bond purchases by $10 billion at each future meeting.
"It's important that we send a signal that we are pretty committed to this current pace," he said, according to Reuters. "The threshold is pretty high going forward before the committee would be willing to change it."
Fed policymakers meet next week, the first session under the central bank's new chief, Janet L. Yellen . Officials voted to reduce the bond purchases at their December and January meetings. The Federal Open Market Committee did not meet in February.
Plosser said he expected U.S. economic growth to improve this year to 3%. That's in line with forecasts by other Fed policymakers of 2.8% to 3.2% growth this year.
"While this is far from the robust growth that many would like to see, it continues to represent steady progress and an improving economy," he said.
With the economy expanding faster, the Fed might need to move quicker to scale back its bond purchases, Plosser said.
"Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts," he said.

Fed s Charles Plosser sees high bar for change in pace of taper
Plosser says recent encouraging economic data isn t enough to change the pace of Fed s  asset purchases

Paris/London/Atlanta: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia president Charles Plosser , who votes on policy this year, said recent encouraging economic data isn t enough to change the pace of the central bank s asset purchases.
 It would have been nice, from my perspective, had we started at a faster pace,  Plosser said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris, referring to the Fed s tapering of its stimulus programme.  Given the fact that we ve embarked on measured reductions, it s important to give some certainty or at least clarity to the markets on what we re doing. It s OK to continue at $10 billion. The hurdle rate for change is pretty high in either direction. 
The Fed is trying to determine whether the economy has shown recent signs of weakness because of severe winter weather or fundamental obstacles to growth. The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets 18-19 March in its first gathering led by chair Janet Yellen since she succeeded Ben S. Bernanke last month.
New York Fed president William C. Dudley said on 7 March he sees a  reasonably favorable  outlook for the economy, even as high unemployment and low inflation warrant stimulus for a  considerable time. 
The US employers added more workers than projected in February, data last week showed, indicating the economy is starting to bounce back from a weather-induced setback. The 175,000 gain in employment followed a revised 129,000 increase the prior month that was bigger than initially estimated.
No Whip-Saw
Improvement in the labour market is one reason the FOMC has trimmed monthly bond purchases by $10 billion in each of its past two meetings. The central bank in January reduced monthly bond purchases to $65 billion.
Policy shouldn t be  whip-sawed from month to month,  Plosser said when asked about the jobs numbers. The numbers were  encouraging,  though they follow other data in the previous two months that were  weak,  he said.
Yellen has pledged to press on with gradual reductions in so-called quantitative easing so long as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.
The Fed has pledged to keep the main interest rate at zero well past the time unemployment falls below 6.5%. Labour department figures showed that joblessness rose to 6.7% in February from 6.6% the month before as more people entered the labour force and couldn t find work.
Plosser, a former University of Rochester economist, became president of the Philadelphia Fed in August 2006. The bank s district includes eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. Bloomberg

Fed's Plosser: Nasty Weather Has Curbed Job Growth

Severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, a top Federal Reserve official said on Monday, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest a bit of weakness in the labor market is only temporary.
In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser pointed to U.S. payroll gains in December, January and February. "All three of these numbers most likely reflected in part the effect of the unusually severe winter weather," he said according to prepared remarks.
A government report on Friday showed U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs last month after creating 129,000 new positions in January. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6.7 percent from a five-year low of 6.6 percent as Americans flooded into the labor market to search for work.
Plosser is a long-time critic of the Fed's aggressive bond-buying program, which is meant to spur hiring and economic growth, but which policymakers have trimmed in measured steps despite some weak growth in jobs, manufacturing and retail sales in the world's largest economy so far this year.
Aside from the reference to the jobs report, Plosser's speech was largely the same as a speech he gave in London on March 6.

Central bank may find itself behind the curve, Philly Fed boss says
By

WilliamHorobin
PARISn   The Federal Reserve may have to accelerate the pace of tapering to take into account the economic pickup currently ongoing in the U.S. and the improving forecast for the near future, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said Monday.
 We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy,  Plosser told a panel in Paris.  Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts. 
Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half.
As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.
But Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.
 If the economy continues to improve, we could find ourselves still trying to increase accommodation in an environment in which history suggests that policy should perhaps be moving in the opposite direction,  Plosser said.
He also raised concerns about how the Fed might ultimately reduce the size of its balance sheet without disrupting inflation or the economy.
 Knock on wood it would all go very smoothly, but you never know,  he said in a question-and-answer session after the speech.

ECB unlikely to end sterilization of SMP purchases: traders
FULL COVERAGE:

BANGALORE The European Central Bank will not stop sterilizing bond purchases it made at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis, a majority of euro money market traders polled by Reuters said.
The ECB bought bonds of some troubled peripheral countries through its Securities Market Programme (SMP) in an attempt to counter spiking yields as the crisis worsened.
In order to keep the money supply stable and avoid fuelling inflation, it "sterilizes" the purchases by offering deposits equal in value to the government bonds it holds.
Eighteen of 23 traders polled expected the central bank to continue doing that, while only five said it would stop.
Some economists and investors had expected the ECB to announce a halt to sterilization at last Thursday's monthly policy meeting, to boost excess liquidity in the financial system and help bring down interbank lending rates.
In the event, it left interest rates on hold and unveiled no other measures to bolster the fragile euro zone recovery, and ECB chief Mario Draghi said the benefits of not sterilizing would be "relatively limited".
The poll predicted that banks will repay 4.0 billion euros ($5.5 billion) of the ECB's three-year emergency loans next week, less than half the 11.4 billion euros they are set to return this week.
The euro zone's central bank pumped over a trillion euros into banks' coffers in two long-term refinancing operations in December 2011 and February 2012 to help lenders ride out funding constraints.
Banks have repaid a little more than half of those loans since January last year, helping push excess liquidity - cash beyond what lenders need to cover their day-to-day operations - down to levels seen before the twin ECB operations.
This week's repayments are more than six times the amount that was expected, accelerating the drain of extra cash out of the bloc's financial system. When asked if the ECB would take steps to provide more liquidity, 14 of 24 traders said they would.
Of those 14 traders who expect a boost, nine said it would come in six months, three in the next three months and the remaining two in a year.
The regular survey showed banks are expected to borrow 90.0 billion euros at the weekly refinancing tender and 6.5 billion euros in a one-month operation.
Eighty-seven billion euros is maturing this week for the one week tender and 6.5 billion euros for the one month.

March 10, 2014
The European Union s half-baked banking union could be made to work   even though it wasn t strictly needed to solve the euro zone s problems and what has been agreed isn t what the designers wanted.
The original advocates of banking union saw it as a way to prevent the euro collapsing during the dark days of early 2012. The idea was that a well-funded, euro-wide deposit insurance scheme would stop savers panicking. Meanwhile, if banks got into trouble, a strong euro-wide safety net would be able to bail them out.
During the crisis, savers and investors lost faith in the ability of weak governments to rescue their banks. That s why banking union enthusiasts wanted euro-wide support systems.
In the end, what has emerged from the European policy factory is completely different. Germany latched onto a part of banking union that hadn t previously got much attention, centralised supervision of banks, and nixed the idea of common deposit insurance. It didn t want to be on the hook for bailing out other countries  banks. Berlin also diluted the plan for a euro-wide safety net for bust banks   though the European Parliament is still trying to beef it up.
Despite all this, banking union doesn t have to be a disaster. To see this, it is important to understand why the euro zone doesn t actually need one.
In 2012 much was made of the  doom loop  that connected weak banks and weak governments. This had two elements: bust banks dragged down their governments if the latter had to bail them out; and bust states dragged down their banks if the latter had bought too many of their bonds.
This doom loop was, and remains, a serious flaw. But it is a mistake to think the only way to cut the loop is by euro-wide bailouts. There are better alternatives.
Look, first, at the problem of bust banks infecting their governments. This is only a problem if taxpayers have to rescue them. But who said governments should be in the business of bailing out banks? It is much better to make banks safe enough so that they don t get in trouble in the first place; and, if they do, to require their investors to foot the bill.
That, indeed, is the broad programme that governments around the globe have been pursuing for the past five years. It involves preventing credit bubbles, forcing banks to hold more capital,  bailing in  bondholders if they run out of equity and restructuring lenders so it is easy to close them down if necessary.
The EU is doing all this too. But it didn t require banking union to push it forward.
That said, the ECB could speed up some of these initiatives.
First, the central bank needs to work out how it is going to stop bubbles. In its new supervisory role, it will have what are known as  macroprudential  powers. This will allow it to tell national authorities to do things like jack up banks  capital ratios if it fears credit is growing too strongly.
The snag is too many cooks may spoil the broth, as there are multiple bodies with macroprudential responsibility for all or parts of the euro zone. Even the ECB will have two units   the new bank supervisor and its financial stability directorate. It needs to provide clarity over who is going to do what.
Second, many banks don t have enough debt that could be easily bailed in if they run out of equity. The solution is to require all banks to hold a minimum amount of bail-in debt, so that taxpayers don t have to ride to the rescue.
This can be done without banking union. Indeed, the Group of 20 nations has asked for a global proposal later this year. The ECB should use its influence to produce a robust proposal.
Then there s the matter of avoiding situations where banks are deemed too important to fail because their bankruptcy would cause havoc for the whole system   and so again have to be rescued. Part of the solution is to require lenders to draw up  resolution plans  that spell out exactly how they can be packed off to the knacker s yard without too much contagion.
Again, banking union is not required. But, as a result of it, the ECB will be responsible for vetting euro zone banks  resolution plans. With luck, the central bank will be less susceptible than national supervisors to lobbying by national champions   and so force banks to restructure themselves if that is needed to stop the too big to fail phenomenon.
Now look at the other half of the doom loop: how weak sovereigns infect their banks. Yet again, banking union per se does nothing to address that problem. It can only be dealt with if lenders are told they can t hold more than a certain amount of their own governments  bonds.
The ECB would prefer to impose such limits as part of a global regime. The snag is that countries with their own currencies and central banks don t have such a need to follow suit. So the ECB may, at some point, have to face going it alone.
It won t be easy for the ECB to bite these bullets. But it will need to, if the euro zone s half-baked banking union is to be turned into something that is fit for purpose.

Europe reaches crunch point on banking union
FULL COVERAGE:
* Countries grapple for deal to prevent embarrassing delay
* Ministers to debate scheme to close banks
* Much still up for grabs, including imposing investor losses
By Jan Strupczewski and John O'Donnell
BRUSSELS, March 10 European governments and lawmakers will try to reach a deal this week on how to wind down failing banks, clearing the way for a landmark reform as time runs out to win European Parliament approval before May elections.
Negotiations are set to span days and may be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for euro zone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one pot of money to pay for it.
"There will not be an outcome today or tomorrow, because the real negotiations will take place on Wednesday and days after that if necessary," Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who is chairing Monday's meeting of euro ministers, told reporters, referring to talks with the European Parliament's lawmakers.
As he entered for the first day of talks with European counterparts, Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said he was optimistic agreement could be clinched.
Talks on a new European agency to shut down failing banks, and on a fund to pay for such closures, need to be agreed before the last sitting of the European Parliament in mid-April.
Failure to do so would delay the law by at least seven months, and probably more. It could also mean it is scrutinised by a new group of lawmakers with a higher count of eurosceptics, as such parties are expected to do well in the May poll.
The banking union, and the clean-up of banks' books that will accompany it, is intended to restore banks' confidence in one another and boost lending across the currency bloc, helping foster growth in the 18 economies that use the euro.
"This is a large scale political project which will allow countries to borrow at the same rate whether you are Spanish, Italian, German or French," French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici told reporters.
New lending has been throttled by banks' efforts to raise capital and cut their risks in recession.
The banking union is also supposed to break the vicious circle of indebted states and the banks that buy their debt, treated in law as 'risk-free' despite Greece's default in all but name.
Euro zone banks now hold about 1.75 trillion euros of government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to the European Central Bank. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the banking system is now on loan to governments.
The biggest political reform since the launch of the euro currency, banking union also touches on sensitive issues for investors, including the imposition of losses on bondholders of failing banks.
Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank will be the supervisor for euro zone banks, a role it takes on in November.
In return for giving its blessing to the wider scheme, Germany wants to see losses imposed from that point onwards on bondholders and others who have backed troubled banks.
TUG OF WAR
Officials caution that a deal may not be possible this week and could be postponed until the end of the month.
To further complicate matters, European governments disagree not only amongst themselves, but also with the European Parliament, which must give its blessing to the project before it can become law.
At the heart of the dispute is the complex process of closing a bank. Countries are reluctant to cede authority to Brussels and want a laborious system of checks before any decision to shut a bank can be taken.
EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the euro zone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that the decision must then be signed into law by the finance ministers.
Under that scenario, if the ministers want to change the board's decision, they also have to involve the European Commission and start a procedure so complex that it is doubtful it can be completed quickly.
The European Parliament, on the other hand, wants no involvement of EU ministers, arguing it would politicise the process and make it cumbersome. It wants leave the final go-ahead to the more impartial European Commission.
Parliament also wants the ECB - the supervisor of all banks - to be the only institution to declare a bank is failing. EU governments want the agency board and national authorities to have a say.
Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the 'resolution' fund, used to cover the costs of shutting a bank, and how soon countries should be able to dip into the pot. The fund will be filled by euro zone banks and is slated to reach around 55 billion euros ($76 billion).
Governments want the fund to reach full size over 10 years, while the parliament wants the fund to be fully available to all euro zone countries after just three years.
Finally, policymakers must decide if they will allow this fund to borrow if it is short of cash, or if it should borrow from the euro zone bailout fund or receive state guarantees.

ECB FOCUS-Stronger euro drowns out ECB's message to keep rates low for longer
FULL COVERAGE:
By Eva Taylor | FRANKFURT, March 10
FRANKFURT, March 10 The European Central Bank's emphasis on slack in the euro zone economy at its March policy meeting shows it intends to keep interest rates low even if growth rates pick up, sending a dovish message.
Investors, however, were disappointed by the ECB's lack of action last week, when the bank published an inflation forecast for 2016 that sees price rises still far below its target for price stability of below but close to 2 percent.
The euro rose against the dollar to a 2-1/2 year high after the ECB signalled no need for new economic stimulus and took a slightly more optimistic view of the recovery. That seemed to have drowned the dovish message the ECB intended to send.
For the first time, the ECB in the opening statement to the post-meeting news conference alluded to "the high degree of unutilised capacity" in the euro zone economy as one of the reasons for subdued inflation extending into the medium term.
"Our monetary policy stance will stay in place even after we see improvements in the economy,... because we have a stock of slack that is weighing on the economy," ECB President Mario Draghi said.
Ahead of the meeting, a growing minority of economists polled by Reuters said the ECB may be forced to print money this year to fight off deflation risks, while some had expected a cut in interest rates, below the record low of 0.25 percent.
The fact that the ECB refrained from suspending the weekly withdrawal of money it spent on Greek and other governments' bonds during the debt crisis - the least divisive "sterlisation" measure - suggests the ECB may have to take a big step next or none at all.
TAKING THE SHINE OFF
Deutsche Bank, for example, now expects rates to remain at a record low of 0.25 percent throughout this year.
"The ECB seems to be 'hoping for the best', and we have probably underestimated the limitations to the Governing Council's room for manoeuvre on its policy instruments in the last few months," said Gilles Moec, economist at Deutsche.
Draghi said the benefits of a so-called sterilisation of bond purchases under its Securities Markets Programme were "relatively limited" because of the short maturity of the bonds still in the SMP portfolio, currently worth 175 billion euros ($242.58 billion).
A programme to revive the market for securitised loans, especially for small and medium sized companies, remains on the agenda, but may require legal and regulatory changes and third party guarantees in order to work, Draghi said.
The ECB could launch another long-term refinancing operation (LTRO), similar to the three-year loans they handed out in late 2011 and early 2012 to ease banks' funding strains, but banks are increasingly paying back such loans early.
Which leaves the most powerful tool to fight deflation, quantitative easing, by which the central bank would buy securities from banks that have then more money to lend.
But while other major central banks, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England have long been relying on this stimulus, QE would be a highly political tool to agree on in the euro zone with its 18 member countries.
Inflation would have to undershoot the ECB's target for price stability significantly to sway the Governing Council.
A further appreciation of the euro might do just that.
The euro hit a 2-1/2 year high on Friday at $1.3915.
ECB Governing Council member Christian Noyer said on Monday he was "not very happy" with the recent appreciation of the euro's exchange rate, because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation.   ($1 = 0.7214 euros)   (Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)

The European Union s to-do list isn t long this week, but anyone interested in financial regulation should get ready for some late nights. The bloc is pushing for a final deal on a new bank-resolution framework for the euro zone and more transparency on foreign bank accounts. The crisis in Ukraine will certainly also occupy minds in Brussels.
On Monday, euro-zone finance ministers meet for some ordinary business: Cyprus, whose third review a year after its bailout was just completed, is expecting a fresh injection of cash to be approved. The money won t reach the island till April. There had been hopes that Greece, too, could get the finance ministers  backing for a fresh disbursement of aid, but the required work in Athens hasn t been concluded. Experts from the troika of institutions overseeing the Greek bailout   the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank   will report to ministers and then return to the Greek capital to wrap up their review.

Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports   fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6%   gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in   February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit   since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year   holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data.   "Despite our belief that the   actual trade situation is better than official   data suggests, the   disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese   yuan(CNY) and the GDP   growth outlook for Q1 2014," say economists at Standard   Chartered.
Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer   price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing   from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing   market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's   producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier,   marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year   drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.
Copper falls.  Copper futures slid   more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China.   However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading   near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.
Quiet markets. Futures point to a   quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P   500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from   Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and   the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of   Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the   Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell   2.9%.
Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data   suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in   the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate.   Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from   5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main   drags on the headline number.
Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a   record current account deficit in January of  1.589 trillion. The   deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade   deficit, which widened to  2.345 trillion fom  1.047 trillion.   "Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next   April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration   of the balance of payments," says Osamu Takashima, a Citi   strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of   the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month   high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence   conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest   confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to   13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market   economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take   the   consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this   month.
Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data   from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing   decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of   2013. "International banking activity was characterised by lower   credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013,   mirroring developments in the previous quarter," said the BIS in   its Quarterly Review   published Sunday . "Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466   billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this   contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late   2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most   pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or   4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres   ($35 billion or 1.7%)."
Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian   military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the   weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international   watchdogs who tried to enter the region. "Ukraine remains very much a potential   dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for   safe haven flow," write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a   note to clients this morning. "For now, though, the market looks to still   be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle   as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports   informing the market rather than any possible concern over   possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports   across Ukraine)."
ECB not happy with euro   strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of   France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is   not happy with the euro's recent strength. "It s a   very important input in the economic development and inflation   development," Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with   Manus Cranny in Paris. "When the euro tends to strengthen, it   creates additional downward pressure on the economy and   inflation, which in both cases isn t warranted. So we re not   happy at the moment." The Governing Council declined to announce   any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting   last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's   comments.

Eurozone banks' sovereign exposure hits new high
By Christopher Whittall & Gareth Gore
LONDON - Banks in the eurozone are now more exposed to government debt than at any time since the financial crisis began, with many increasingly using their balance sheets to prop up ailing governments, deepening the bank-sovereign link that has already pushed a number of countries and lenders into bailouts.
Banks in the region now hold about 1.75 trillion euros in government debt, equivalent to 5.7 percent of their assets and the highest relative exposure since 2006, according to European Central Bank data. In Italy and Spain, roughly one in every 10 euros in the entire banking system is now on loan to governments.
Although the ECB has said it is keen to break what it terms the sovereign-bank nexus, analysts warn that its hands are tied. European governments need - and many encourage - their banks to finance growing public debt piles because many simply do not have enough alternative buyers after an exodus of foreign investors.
"The sovereign-bank nexus is growing and it is a concern," said Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a strategist at JP Morgan. "The ECB and regulators want to reduce this risk, but they know they can't right now because the region is only just emerging from a debt crisis. If debt sustainability issues resurface in the future, it will be a problem for heavily exposed banks."
Since the 1980s, global banking regulations have enshrined incentives to hold government debt by making it zero risk-weighted. The Basel Committee chose not to change these zero weightings when the rules were last updated in 2010. Fitch said the latest rulebook even "turbocharges" previous risk weightings.
"The reason that government bonds are zero risk-weighted by regulators is partly political; it is not how we weight them in our credit analysis," said Bridget Gandy, a bank analyst at Fitch, who added that underdeveloped capital markets often necessitate the bank-sovereign nexus.
"Somebody has to buy government bonds, and many countries have traditionally leant on their banking systems to do exactly that. Only once a country's capital markets develop, with a healthy insurance and pension sector, do you increase the pool of buyers, and some countries aren't there yet."
The ECB is blamed by many for having facilitated an increase in exposures, providing banks with cheap loans initially at just 1 percent - falling recently to 0.25 percent - which they can pump into government securities that over the past few years have yielded 7 percent and more - in effect an easy profit.
Cash-strapped peripheral banks - many of which have been shut out of primary markets - have welcomed the opportunity to plug capital shortfalls, ploughing over half of their net borrowings from the ECB's emergency longer-term refinancing operations facility into bonds, while lending a mere 13% to the real economy, according to JP Morgan figures.
The carry trade is estimated to be worth between 5 billion euros and 20 billion euros a year to Spanish and Italian banks, with many firms using the trade not only to hide deep losses, but also as a way to build up capital buffers - in effect using ECB funds to save private shareholders from being diluted.
Banks' holdings of government bonds have risen by 355 billion euros - or about 25 percent - since the liquidity injections in late 2011 and early 2012. Banks in fiscally weak countries have increased their purchases the most, with Italian, Portuguese and Spanish banks increasing their holdings by 62 percent, 52 percent and 45 percent respectively.
"Policymakers say that they need to break this negative feedback loop, but as a side effect, ECB policies have enabled banks to load up on government debt which has furthered the link between banks and their home sovereign," said Stefan Best, a bank analyst at Standard & Poor's.
"The LTRO allowed banks to borrow huge amounts of cash from the central bank at low interest rates and several have used that money to buy government debt to bolster revenues," said Best. "Governments have not objected to them doing this."
It is not the first time that banks have piled into a sovereign-debt-linked carry trade in search of easy money. In the previous decade, many banks, including BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank bought billions in Greek debt in order to cash in on the extra yield offered.
That trade spectacularly backfired when Athens was forced to restructure its private debts, leaving those four banks with multi-billion euro losses and the Greek and Cypriot banking systems in need of mass recapitalizations after organizations bailing out the country decided to impose a haircut on Greek debt.
Italy's debt-to-GDP ratio at the end of last year was 133 percent, higher than the 129 percent that Greece had in the last full year before it asked for a bailout. Spain also has a debt higher than its annual GDP. According to the IMF, there have been 600 cases of sovereign debt restructuring since the 1950s in 95 countries, often with debt levels lower than Spain and Italy.
Although banks' exposure to government debt is now lower than in the 1990s, when banks in countries including Belgium and Greece devoted more than 20 percent of their balance sheets to sovereign debt, public debt levels across Europe are much higher today, increasing the risk of a debt restructuring.
In Spain and Italy, exposures have increased rapidly in recent years. Spanish banks now hold 297 billion euros of government debt, equivalent to 9.4 percent of total industry assets and up from less than 3 percent in late 2008. Italian banks hold 407 billion euros, roughly 10 percent of total assets and up from 4.6 percent in late 2008.
That growing exposure would increase the risk and cost of mass bank recapitalization in the event of a government debt restructuring.
"The ECB is keen to reduce this dangerous link but it can't escape the fact that many governments still need banks to buy their debt," said Alberto Gallo, a credit strategist at RBS. "The purpose of banks isn't to finance their national governments, but they are being encouraged to do precisely that." [Reuters]

Forex Market: EUR/USD retreats from 2-1/2-year highs as stronger euro seen creating pressure on economy
March 10, 2014 12:38 pm
The euro retreated from highs unseen since October 2011 against the US dollar, after European Central Bank Governing Council member Christian Noyer said that strengthening of the 18-nation common currency created downward pressure on euro zone s economy.
EUR/USD hit a session low at 1.3867 at 11:27 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 1.3882 at 12:35 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be found at March 7th low, 1.3852, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 1.3915, also the pair s strongest since October 2011.
 It s a very important input in the economic development and inflation development,  Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris.  When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn t warranted. So we re not happy at the moment. 
The 18-nation common currency has risen 6.7% in the past 12 months, curbing the price of imported goods, while challenging the competitiveness of euro zone s exporters.
Last week, ECB President Mario Draghi also addressed the problem, saying that a stronger euro may affect the central bank s price-stability objective.
On March 6th, the Governing Council of the ECB maintained its benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.25%. The Council also decided to keep the deposit rate at zero and the marginal lending rate at 0.75%. On the press conference, following ECB s interest rate decision the central bank President Mario Draghi said that deflation risks in the euro area are easing, boosting euro s demand.
The ECB predicted that inflation will gradually accelerate. According to central bank s estimates inflation in the euro area, which was at 0.8% last month, will accelerate to 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The cost of living will rise 1% this year, while it will accelerate to 1.3% in 2015 and an average 1.5% in 2015.
In February, Eurostat reported that the inflation rate had rebounded from a 4-year low of 0.7% in October, which prompted the ECB to cut the main interest rate unexpectedly in November. Inflation in the euro area grew at an annualized rate of 0.8% in February, the same as in the previous month and exceeding analysts  projections for a 0.7% increase.
At the same time, core consumer prices, which exclude volatile items such as food, energy, tobacco and alcohol increased at an annualized rate of 1% in February, exceeding experts  forecasts for a 0.8% advance and up from January s 0.8% increase. February s reading was also the strongest since September.
While the recovery remains fragile, with inflation still remaining less than half the ECB target of 2%, which the central bank uses to define price stability, economic data in the past four weeks seemed encouraging. Gross domestic product in the 18-nation common currency area rose 0.3%, more than analysts had projected, mainly driven by stronger expansions in Germany, France, Netherlands and a return to growth in Italy. In addition, economic sentiment jumped to more than a 2-1/2-year high last month, while services and manufacturing output surged the most since June 2011.
Meanwhile, greenback s demand was supported on Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US reported that nation s employers managed to add 175 000 workers to payrolls in February, after a revised up 129 000 increase in the previous month. Analysts had expected a 149 000 advance in February. At the same time, the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6.7% last month from a 5-year low of 6.6% as more Americans entered the workforce, but couldn t find a job. The US added 194 000 jobs on average, each month last year.
The report suggested that US employers were upbeat about the economic outlook, after recent winter storms and much-below-normal temperatures across the US and especially across the eastern parts of the country, slowed consumer spending, housing and manufacturing.
 The fundamentals are good,  Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York, commented in a Bloomberg interview before the report.  Faster job growth means faster income and more discretionary spending. Ultimately, with more business spending, not only will they hire more people, they ll hire more capital. Everything becomes self-reinforcing. 
At the same time, the deficit on United States  trade balance widened insignificantly to reach 39.1 billion USD in January, after in December the deficit figure has been revised to 38.975 billion USD from 38.701 billion USD previously. Analysts had anticipated a deficit at the amount of 38.500 billion USD in January.
Factors behind this wider deficit have been the weaker fuel export and the increased import of oil. A larger trade deficit usually causes an adverse impact upon economic growth. Imports rose 0.6% to reach 231.6 billion USD in January, while overall export increased also by 0.6% to reach 192.5 billion USD during the same month.
Elsewhere, USD/JPY touched a session low at 102.94 at 07:05 GMT, after which the pair trimmed daily losses to trade little changed at 103.29 at 09:30 GMT, adding 0.03% for the day. Support was likely to be received at March 7th low, 102.84, while resistance was to be encountered at March 7th high, 103.76, also the pair s strongest since January 23rd.

UPDATE 1-ECB to reveal bad loan hurdles for euro zone bank test -sources
FULL COVERAGE:
* Impairments and 'hard to value' assets key areas
* Loans pitted against auditors' 'challenger models'
* Collateral not valued for over a year must be revalued
By Laura Noonan
DUBLIN, March 10 The European Central Bank's stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone's largest banks when it details on Tuesday how it will test balance sheets, three sources with knowledge of the tests told Reuters.
The details will give the 128 banks being tested their most explicit insight to date on how their books will be examined by inspectors looking at whether they need billions of euros of extra capital to strengthen balance sheets. Estimates of the capital shortfall range from 280 billion euros ($388.13 billion)to as much as 770 billion.
The tests are being carried out to restore investor confidence in the banks and clean up any problems left over from the financial crisis before the ECB becomes their supervisor in November.
As well as the initial review on whether banks' assets are correctly valued now, banks will also be subjected to a stress test looking at whether they need more capital to deal with future crises.
A document detailing the tests' methodology has been in circulation amongst national supervisors and consultants for several weeks. Recipients have signed non-disclosure agreements and face penalties for any breaches.
"It will terrify them, even though they've got a reasonable idea of what's coming," one source with knowledge of the guidelines told Reuters, pointing to the very prescriptive approach laid out over nearly 300 pages.
The ECB declined to comment.
The three sources said the most closely-watched areas in Tuesday's announcement would be the ECB's view of when loans become impaired, and the way 'hard to value assets' are treated.
For loan losses, the guidelines include a simple rule that any loan more than 90 days overdue is non-performing and a more complex one that sets out the other triggers that suggest full repayment is unlikely, two of the sources said.
A third source said that while the ECB's decision on impairment triggers was "reasonable" some banks would still fall short of it since not all banks would use all the triggers on the ECB's list of definitions of indicators for impairment.
Triggers can include things like evidence that a corporate borrower is in distress and evidence that the value of the collateral underpinning a loan has fallen. "Triggers can be subjective," the second source said.
If a loan's status is changed from performing to non-performing, it would have a higher probability of default, some thing that would force a bank to set aside more capital to provide for higher likely losses.
Banks' estimates on loan losses will be pitted against 'challenger models' created by external auditors - carrying out the tests on behalf of supervisors - an approach first tried in Ireland's balance sheet assessment in late 2013, two of the sources said.
Previous rounds of bank tests have tested the models in use by the banks rather than creating brand new ones.
The rules also require that new valuations must be done for any collateral that had not been valued within a year of January 2014, two of the sources said.
Beyond loans, the ECB's treatment of 'Level 3 assets', a broad group of assets that are difficult to value, will also be closely watched. Those Level 3 assets include derivatives and also include assets such as real estate holdings banks have acquired through foreclosures, their participations in private equity deals and special investment vehicles.
The ECB has taken care to prevent any leaks. Recipients of details of the review face fines of 100,000 euros for leaks and copies have been water-marked with the name of its owner, the sources said.

ECB to reveal bad loan hurdles for euro zone bank test - sources

ECB set to reveal how it will define euro zone banks' bad loans
The European Central Bank's stance on how bad loans are defined will be one of the biggest revelations to the euro zone's largest banks when it details tomorrow how it will test balance sheets.

10 Things You Need To Know Before The Opening Bell

REUTERS/Jorge Silva
An anti-government protester sets up a barricade next to a burning kiosk during a protest at Altamira square in Caracas March 9, 2014. Latin American foreign ministers will meet next week to discuss the unrest in Venezuela that has left at least 20 dead and convulsed the South American OPEC nation, diplomatic sources said on Friday.
Good morning. Here's what you need to know.
Chinese exports tumble. Chinese exports fell 18.1% from a year earlier in February after logging a 10.6% gain in January. Imports rose 10% from a year earlier in February, causing China to report the first monthly trade deficit since March 2013. The weakness likely owes to the Lunar New Year holiday and inflated trade invoicing, which obscures the data. " Despite our belief that the actual trade situation is better than official data suggests, the disappointing February trade data is negative for the Chinese yuan (CNY) and the GDP growth outlook for Q1 2014," say economists at Standard Chartered.
Chinese inflation disappoints. China's consumer price index rose 2.0% from a year earlier in February, slowing from January's 2.5% year-over-year pace of growth and missing market economists' consensus forecasts for a 2.1% rise. China's producer price index, meanwhile, fell 2.0% from a year earlier, marking an accelerated decline from January's 1.6% year-over-year drop and missing forecasts for a 1.9% decline.
Copper falls. Copper futures slid more than 4% overnight in reaction to the news out of China. However, the metal has since rebounded and futures are trading near $3.03 a pound, down only 1.8%.
Quiet markets. Futures point to a quiet open to begin the week in North American trading. S&P 500 and U.S. Treasury note futures are little changed from Friday's close, and the U.S. dollar is flat against the euro and the yen. European indices are mostly higher with the exception of Germany's DAX. Overnight, the Japanese Nikkei 225 fell 1.0%, the Hong Kong Hang Seng fell 1.8%, and the Shanghai Composite fell 2.9%.
Japan GDP growth revised down. Revised GDP data suggest Japan's economy expanded only 0.7% at an annualized pace in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from the previous 1.0% estimate. Downward revisions to business investment growth (to 3.0% from 5.3%) and consumer spending (to 1.6% from 2.0%) were the main drags on the headline number.
Record Japanese deficits. Japan also announced a record current account deficit in January of  1.589 trillion. The deterioration in the current account owed largely to the trade deficit, which widened to  2.345 trillion fom  1.047 trillion. " Rush demands before the consumption tax increase next April are pushing imports up and resulting in the deterioration of the balance of payments," says Osamu Takashima, a Citi strategist who believes the widening deficits are supportive of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.
Euro zone investor confidence hits 35-month high. A survey of euro zone investor confidence conducted by market research firm Sentix revealed the highest confidence in 35 months. The report's headline index advanced to 13.9 in March from February's 13.3 reading. Still, market economists were looking for a slightly more sanguine take - the consensus forecast was that the index would rise to 14.0 this month.
Cross-border lending contracts. The latest data from the Bank for International Sentiments revealed a continuing decline in cross-border bank lending in the third quarter of 2013. "International banking activity was characterised by lower credit to both banks and non-banks in the third quarter of 2013, mirroring developments in the previous quarter," said the BIS in its Quarterly Review published Sunday . "Cross-border claims on banks fell by $466 billion (2.7%). Inter-office positions accounted for most of this contraction, continuing the steady decline that began in late 2011. The retreat in cross-border interbank activity was most pronounced for claims on banks in the euro area ($205 billion or 4.2%), United Kingdom ($250 billion or 7.8%) and offshore centres ($35 billion or 1.7%)."
Russia tightens its grip on Ukraine. Pro-Russian military forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimea region over the weekend, seizing an airfield and turning back international watchdogs who tried to enter the region. "Ukraine remains very much a potential dampener of market risk appetite and, by extension, a trigger for safe haven flow," write Rabobank interest rate strategists in a note to clients this morning. " For now, though, the market looks to still be adopting a sanguine approach to the ongoing Ukrainian debacle as evidenced by the dip in oil prices (softer Chinese exports informing the market rather than any possible concern over possible disruption to the transit of European energy imports across Ukraine)."
ECB not happy with euro strength. ECB Governing Council Member and Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said this morning that the ECB is not happy with the euro's recent strength. "It's a very important input in the economic development and inflation development," Noyer said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Manus Cranny in Paris. "When the euro tends to strengthen, it creates additional downward pressure on the economy and inflation, which in both cases isn't warranted. So we're not happy at the moment." The Governing Council declined to announce any new policy action at the conclusion of its monthly meeting last week, and the euro is little changed on Noyer's comments.

Below is a Business Insider Q&A with Aurelija Augulyte, a macro strategist at Nordea Markets.
***
BUSINESS INSIDER: To what extent do you think poor weather has impacted this winter's economic data?
AURELIJA AUGULYTE: 35%.
BI: What's the big story that nobody is talking about right now?
AA: Few are talking about the true risks of domestic debt crisis potential in Asia. Asian EM FX is still perceived as a "safe haven" on wrong comparisons with previous classical EM crises. This time is different. Asian EM FX are most overvalued. If they are forced to defend their currencies at some point, this will result in unwelcome tightening of monetary conditions (essentially the reverse of what has been happening until recently, resulting in rapid domestic credit expansion).
BI: Are you optimistic about Janet Yellen as Fed chair?
AA: Yes, she is consistent, and the "Yellen put" should be at work to ensure that any correction in stock markets won't be too deep (up to 15%).
BI: The stock market is roaring back to all-time highs. Do issues in EM not have as big an impact on U.S. markets as people argued a few weeks ago?
AA: They should. But we haven't seen an EM crisis yet - only localized FX adjustments. No big change in credit spreads yet. Thus no spillover to global credit, liquidity premia and volatility. Still pending!
BI: What's something you'll be watching this week and next?
AA: If not watching, then listening to the multiple speeches from Fed members. Their take on recent data weakness. Data-wise I think everything will be seen through the "it's weather, stupid" filter by markets, still.

UPDATE 1-Central banks must contain threat from low prices -Noyer
FULL COVERAGE:
* Noyer sees "permanent and deep forces" weighing on inflation
* Euro strength adding to downward inflation pressures   (Adds details on ECB action)
PARIS, March 10 Price stability is under threat in major economies from low inflation, warranting action by central banks, ECB policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday.
Noyer, the governor of the Bank of France, warned that "permanent and deep forces" were weighing on inflation in the euro zone and wider world.
"Monetary policy should remain active because persistently low inflation threatens the achievement of price stability as commonly defined by all major central banks today," Noyer told a conference at the French central bank.
Noyer cited slack in many economies as a source of low inflation, as well as deleveraging in the euro zone, where many countries are slowly working off excessive debt.
"The recent appreciation of the euro has had indeed a strong disinflationary impact," Noyer added. The euro rose in recent days to 1.39 to the dollar, its highest since late 2011, after the European Central Bank left its monetary policy unchanged on Thursday.
The Eurostat EU statistics agency estimated euro zone inflation held steady in February at 0.8 percent, well below the ECB's target of close to but less than 2.0 percent.
Noyer said he did not currently see deflation - what he described as a "pernicious spiral" downward in prices that chokes consumption and investment - in the euro zone and that inflation expectations were firmly anchored in positive territory.
The ECB's inflation target was meant to provide a cushion against negative shocks to the economy that could drive inflation lower, Noyer said. The euro zone was vulnerable without a buffer, he said.
Against that background, the ECB's Governing Council has made it explicit that its members expect to keep interest rates at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.
Such forward guidance is a relatively new tool the ECB has called on to influence the economy. Noyer said it was unlikely central banks would go back to relying solely on their conventional tool, short-term interest rates.
But even with more levers available to central banks than in the past, Noyer warned that there were limits to what monetary policy could do.
"The longer interest rates are kept at low levels, the greater the risk for financial stability," he said.   (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Larry King)

ECB's Noyer says 'not happy' with euro's rise

INDIA ELECTIONS 2017
PARIS, March 10 French European Central Banker Christian Noyer voiced concern on Monday over the appreciation of the euro and said he shared the view of his German counterpart on policy options that could be used by the euro zone's central bank.
"I fully agree with Jens Weidmann that the suspension of sterilisation is one of the tools we may use if needed," Noyer, head of the Bank of France and a member of the ECB's governing council alongside Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, told Bloomberg TV on the sidelines of a conference in Paris.
Concerning appreciation of the euro's exchange rate, Noyer said he was "not very happy" because it put downward pressure on the economy and on inflation.   (Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Hugh Lawson)

PARIS--The slow pace of price increases and nominal wages in the euro area risks hampering adjustment strategies within the currency zone, a process necessary for some member countries to become more competitive, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said Monday.
"The euro area needs such adjustments in order for some countries, including France, to regain competitiveness," Mr. Noyer said. "This process would be made easier if overall euro inflation stayed closer to the ECB's definition of price stability."
A country's inflation differential with others has a direct impact on its real exchange rate, a measure of its competitiveness. In order to make the goods and services it produces more competitive, a euro zone country would need to post inflation lower than the bloc's, a difficult challenge if prices are overall close to zero.
Euro zone inflation has slowed markedly in recent years, with many analysts raising the specter of Japan-style deflation taking over the currency area. The ECB also recently lowered its forecast for inflation this year to 1% from an earlier forecast of 1.1% in December, but said inflation would gradually rise to 1.3% in 2015. By 2016, inflation should reach 1.5%, still shy of the ECB's target of just under 2% over the medium term.
Still, Mr. Noyer insisted that the euro zone isn't facing deflation.
"Low inflation is not deflation," Mr. Noyer told a panel discussion at the Bank of France, noting that expectations remain firmly anchored in positive territory, even in the short run. "There's no deflation today in the euro area: prices are still increasing, and most importantly, so are nominal wages."
He warned however that the problem needs serious consideration, and that even small signs that a generalized fall in prices and wages is taking place should be carefully watched.
"The situation today calls for a very careful assessment in the balance of risks," Mr. Noyer said. "Precisely because deflation is hard to reverse, even small probabilities should not be neglected and they should be fully factored into policymaking."
The reasons for low inflation are multiple, Mr. Noyer said, but pointed to an important unused capacity and to the recent appreciation of the euro as the main ones.

Failing banks focus of EU talks
Monday, March 10, 2014
By Jan Strupczewski and Martin Santa, Reuters
European Union governments and parliamentarians will try to reach a compromise this week on how to wind down failing banks in marathon talks intended to settle who decides to close banks and who picks up the bill.
A deal in the negotiations, set to span three days, would be the final step in a European banking union that would mean one supervisor for all eurozone banks, one set of rules to close or restructure those in trouble and one common pot of money to pay for it.
The union, and the thorough clean-up of banks  books that will accompany it, is meant to restore banks  confidence in one another and boost lending to other businesses and households.
New lending has been throttled by banks  efforts to raise capital and reduce the bad loans that proliferated in the recession triggered by the global financial crisis and deepened by the eurozone s own sovereign debt crisis.
Policymakers agreed last year that the European Central Bank (ECB) will be the single supervisor for all eurozone banks from November.
But talks on a single European agency to wind up or close failing banks, and on a single fund to back it up, have entered a crucial stage: EU governments, represented by finance ministers of the 28-nation bloc, and the European Parliament must reach a deal next week.
If they don t, there won t be enough time to complete the legislative process for the resolution mechanism before the last sitting of the current parliament in mid-April. The key law would be delayed by at least seven months, probably more.
 The ground is very well prepared, now we have to show political will. We will stay there (in the meeting) as long as it takes to find a solution,  one EU official involved in the preparations for the talks said.
 It s clear to all EU member states that if we want to achieve an agreement there s only one direction to go   to try to accommodate the parliament,  the official said.
The problem is that European governments and the European Parliament want different things.
EU finance ministers agreed in early December that a decision on closing down a bank in the eurozone would be taken by the board of the resolution agency, but that decision must be signed into law by the EU s executive Commission and by all the finance ministers.
The European Parliament wants no involvement of EU finance ministers, arguing it would politicise the process.
Parliament also wants the ECB   the supervisor of all banks   to be the only institution that can declare a bank is failing and that its fate has to be resolved. EU governments want the single resolution agency board and national authorities to have a say.
Governments and parliamentarians also disagree on how quickly to build up the shared resolution fund and how soon all the money in it should be accessible to all countries.
The fund will be filled from contributions of all eurozone banks and is to reach, eventually, around  55bn.

The conventional wisdom is that, when confronted by a bear, you should lie motionless until it loses interest (or assumes that you are dead) and leaves you alone. But there are different species of bear, with some more likely to be deterred by bold, purposeful action. The question is how to determine the right approach when terror incarnate is staring you in the face.
This scenario is helpful for thinking about the eurozone as it attempts to survive its next round of trials   beginning with the European Parliament election in May. Can it continue simply to  lie still , hoping that no new shocks arise that diminish its economic health, if not threaten its survival?
Some take the sanguine view that the current  lie still  approach is adequate to ensure that the eurozone economy does more than avoid decline. From their perspective, Germany s decision over the last three years to permit actual and prospective transfers just large enough to prevent financial meltdown will somehow be enough to enable the eurozone finally to begin to recover from a half-decade of recession and stagnation.
But the fact is that these transfers   that is, European Stability Mechanism-financed bail-out programmes and the European Central Bank s prospective  outright monetary transactions  (OMT) bond-buying scheme   can do little more than fend off collapse. They cannot boost economic output, because they are conditional upon recipient countries  continued pursuit of internal devaluation (lowering domestic wages and prices).
Reinvigorating the eurozone economy requires a more radical effort to resolve the inter-linked sovereign-debt and banking crises. Specifically, it demands sovereign-debt mutualisation through Eurobonds, and thus the elimination of eurozone countries  fiscal sovereignty, and a full-fledged banking union with recapitalisation authority and shared deposit insurance   a far cry from the arrangement that has been agreed.
If Europe s leaders continue to choose mild palliatives over bold tactics, the best-case scenario is a lacklustre recovery, with GDP growing at a 1%-2% annual rate. Unfortunately, this best case probably is not enough to prevent future sovereign-debt defaults in countries like Italy, Spain, and eventually even France. In other words, at some point, lying still will no longer be an option.
In fact, eurozone leaders might be spurred into action even sooner. While the prospect of OMT seems to be keeping financial shocks at bay, at least for now, a political shock seems increasingly likely, with voters reacting against the internal-devaluation policies that are fuelling high unemployment and undermining living standards. The upcoming European Parliament election could be just such a shock.
As it stands, Europe s political class is committed to internal devaluation in all of the troubled eurozone economies. The alternative approach   dismantling the eurozone to allow for external devaluations   has thus become the playground of hitherto marginal political parties, which are now surging ahead in opinion polls.
In France, the groups concerned   the National Front and the Union of the Left   represent political extremes. In Italy, a more ideologically neutral anti-establishment force may arise, with a much sharper anti-euro focus than Beppe Grillo s populist Five Star Movement, which emerged last year to become the country s third-largest political force. As these parties gain traction, the euro s chances of survival diminish.
The predicament of Europe s political establishment stems from a combination of irrational fear and vain ambition. This is particularly apparent in France, where the monetary union has often been viewed as a tool for harnessing Germany s economic strength to project power worldwide. Given that dismantling the eurozone would mean the end of the French establishment s European project and would weaken Europe s ability to advance its interests vis- -vis global powers like the United States and China,  monetary anti-union  is unthinkable.
France s global ambition is apparent whenever its mainstream politicians discuss the euro. For example, in 2011, Edmond Alphand ry, a former economy minister, declared that a eurozone exit by a member country was as likely as a dollar exit by Texas or California. Here, on full display, was the wishful thinking that brought the euro into existence in the first place: its French architects dreamed of a Europe that could equal the US. That was always an illusory ambition, but it continues to cloud European leaders  judgment.
The single currency s advocates are right about one thing: political motives have always underpinned the establishment of monetary unions, from Latin America s in the period from 1865 to 1927 to that between Ireland and Britain from 1922 to 1979. But they are missing a crucial point: politics is also the reason for these unions  dissolution. When the economic costs and divergences become too much of a threat, the political will to do what it takes to ensure the common currency s survival collapses.
Voter reaction against the euro may well force the eurozone to stop lying still and take real action. The question is whether that would mean that some or all eurozone countries must go their separate ways.

Omega's Cooperman: eBay should spin off portion of PayPal
March 10, 2014|Reuters
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leon Cooperman, chief executive of hedge fund Omega Advisors, said Monday that he agreed with activist investor Carl Icahn's push for eBay Inc to spin off its PayPal online payments business.
"I give Carl a lot of credit for taking the time and showing the energy, and in this case, we happen to agree with him," Cooperman, an eBay shareholder, said on CNBC television. "I think they should spin out a portion of PayPal," he said, noting that he owns about 2 percent of eBay shares.
Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off PayPal. The billionaire investor has repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.
Cooperman also said that the U.S. stock market was fairly valued at its current levels and would be surprised if it shot higher.
The Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 29.6 percent last year, notching its best annual performance since 1997. The benchmark index has risen about 1.6 percent so far this year.
In a separate interview, Icahn told CNBC that eBay Chief Executive John Donahoe has delivered "mediocre" results for the company versus peers such as Amazon, Visa and MasterCard Inc.
EBay rejected Icahn's two nominees to its board on Monday, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.
Icahn said Monday that nutrition and weight loss company Herbalife was not a pyramid scheme, a claim that hedge fund manager William Ackman has made. Icahn and Ackman have publicly feuded over the company's value.
Icahn owned about 16.8 percent of Herbalife's shares at the end of last year, according to regulatory filings, while Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management has bet $1.16 billion that the company is a fraud.
"It has gone to a point that I think is almost bordering on the insane," Icahn said in response to a New York Times article on Monday about Ackman's $1 billion bet that Herbalife will fail, entitled "After Big Bet, Hedge Fund Pulls the Levers of Power."
Icahn, chairman of Icahn Enterprises L.P., said he had "never sold a share" of Herbalife.

EBay has come out swinging against activist investor Carl Icahn.
The San Jose e-tailer on Monday officially rejected Icahn s proposed two board nominees. Icahn, who holds a 2.2 percent stake in eBay, wants the company to spin off PayPal, its electronic payments division. He wanted two of his employees on the eBay board to promote that agenda.
 Neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise,  said Richard Schlosberg, chairman of eBay s corporate governance and nominating committee.
Instead, eBay backs the re-election of four existing board members: President and CEO John Donahoe; Fred Anderson, co-founder and managing director of Elevation Partners; Edward Barnholt, former CEO of Agilent Technologies; and Scott Cook, co-founder and chairman of Intuit.
Talking smack, the company and the pugnacious billionaire issued dueling press releases notable for their frankness.
In a lengthy screed on his website, ShareholdersSquareTable, Icahn accused eBay CEO John Donohoe of  inexcusable incompetence (that) cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion  for selling Skype too soon and too cheaply. He also attacked eBay board member Marc Andreessen, whose investor group bought Skype and then flipped it to Microsoft at a $4 billion premium. Previously, he d also taken aim at Intuit s Cook,
Under eBay s tender ministrations, PayPal may  wither,  Icahn wrote.   I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL ,  he wrote.
For its part, Ebay said Icahn is dabbling in  false and misleading  statements .
 New eBay shareholder Carl Icahn has cherry-picked old news clips and anecdotes out of context to attack the integrity of two of the most respected, accomplished and value-driven technology leaders in Silicon Valley,  it said, referring to Andreessen and Cook.  And eBay Inc. President and CEO John Donahoe is widely respected for his turnaround of eBay and leadership of the company over the past six years.  
Icahn s 2.2 percent eBay stake isn t actually enough for him to actually wrest much control. So what s his real agenda?
As Icahn biographer Mark Stevens last week told Chronicle business editor and columnist Tom Lee :  It s all a game to him. He s a master chess player. The only person who knows what Carl Icahn really wants is Carl Icahn.

The new Carl Icahn letter is out.
More to come...
Here's the letter:
CARL ICAHN ON EBAY :
"WE BELIEVE BASED ON EVIDENCE WE HAVE NEWLY UNCOVERED THAT DONAHOE'S INEXCUSABLE INCOMPETENCE COST EBAY STOCKHOLDERS OVER $4 BILLION. READ OUR LATEST LETTER AND YOU BE THE JUDGE."
New York, New York, March 10, 2014 - Today Carl C. Icahn released the following open letter to stockholders of eBay Inc.:
We believe, based on our review of the evidence currently available in the public domain, including eBay's own statements, that the following assertions are indisputable . Stockholders: you be the judge.
? eBay CEO John Donahoe oversaw a premature sale of Skype at a diminished price that resulted in eBay stockholders losing over $4 billion as compared to the sale of Skype to Microsoft 18 months later.
? Who can doubt that if eBay were a private company, Donahoe would be fired when the facts were disclosed to the owners? But sadly at many of our public companies, such as eBay, there is a lack of accountability, and transgressions by management are swept under the rug by crony boards. If middle management makes a costly error, they pay the price; if the CEO makes one, too often the "old boy" board covers it up and gives him a bonus.
? In 2009, Donahoe decided to sell Skype in, according to eBay, "a competitive process with multiple bidders including several financial and strategic buyers." [1] We are not sure whether there actually were "multiple bidders" as eBay originally stated or whether eBay merely "contact[ed] multiple financial and strategic buyers" [2] as they now claim. Regardless, Microsoft clearly was interested in buying Skype but "walked away" because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Skype's founders.
? In litigation documents [3] that we have just uncovered , Skype's founders alleged that John Donahoe and eBay director Marc Andreessen's investor group received information from Mike Volpi, an associate of Skype's founders, that there could be a workaround of the technology that was the subject of the licensing dispute between eBay and Skype's founders and that was reportedly the cause of Microsoft "walking away."
? With the apparent benefit of this information, Andreessen's investor group purchased a controlling interest in Skype from eBay for $1.9 billion. The Andreessen investor group then quickly settled the licensing litigation with Skype's founders, and flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion - tripling their money in only 18 months. The obvious unanswered question is: why didn't Donahoe, who allegedly also had the information that would be key to reaching a settlement with Skype's founders, settle it for eBay and sell Skype directly to Microsoft, thereby keeping the extra $4 billion for eBay stockholders?
? To make matters even more embarrassing for Donahoe, Marc Andreessen boasted upon the announcement of the sale to Microsoft that his group's risks in buying Skype had always been less than they had appeared. He said that he " knew that for Microsoft and a number of other companies Skype would be an obvious thing to buy " and that he "[would] always have the fall-back of selling to strategic buyers ." [4] Obviously, the same logic should also have applied to Donahoe. Therefore, why did he sell Skype to the Andreessen investor group instead of keeping the $4 billion for stockholders (it would have been interesting to see Donahoe's face when Andreessen actually boasted about his windfall)? The board and Donahoe, in typical PR speech, have swept this $4 billion fiasco under the rug and have actually boasted about their success in executing this transaction between eBay and the Andreessen investor group. However, Joe Nocera of the New York Times does not appear to have been fooled by eBay's PR machine. At the time of the sale to Andreessen's group, he wrote: "And so, the mystery of the Skype deal: why were the winning bidders willing to pay so high a price for a company whose very existence could be threatened by this lawsuit? One possibility is that they have nerves of steel. The other is that they know something nobody else does ." [5]
? Amazingly, Donahoe chose to sell a controlling interest in Skype to Andreessen's investor group, allowing them to reap billions at the expense of eBay and its stockholders, rather than cleaning up the licensing issues and then pursuing a more lucrative exit, such as an IPO or a sale to a strategic buyer.
? Any first year student in finance would understand that if you want to sell a company and you have a party that wishes to buy but is concerned about technology licensing issues, you fix the issues and then you sell. It's even more absurd not to do so when you know there is a potential solution. I believe that all stockholders must consider whether Donahoe is either incompetent or negligent or, perhaps even worse, was simply taking the easy path of bowing to the wishes of a respected and powerful board member. At any rate, this failure cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion.
? I have been so successful with companies over the years because I have brought in the right CEO. Sometimes convincing boards to make changes takes years, but when change ultimately comes the results are often startlingly good. In just the last year, simply examine our successes at Forest Laboratories and Chesapeake Energy etc. We believe that at the very least, eBay stockholders must send Donahoe and the board a message that we are very unhappy with the current situation at eBay. In addition to the egregious issues surrounding the Skype situation, it should also be noted that in just the past year eBay has underperformed its peers. Indeed, from January 1, 2013 through our initial involvement on January 10, 2014, Amazon, Visa and MasterCard returned 60%, 48% and 73%, respectively, while eBay stock returned only 2%.
? In our opinion, eBay and PayPal should immediately be separated. It is my firm belief that if this occurred, there would be a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal. However, on the other hand, I fear that if left under the management of eBay it will "wither" (as Elon Musk said). I believe that if it is left as a division of eBay, PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL - the same way that Motorola Mobility may have gone had we not been able to convince Motorola's board to bring in a new CEO and separate the companies - ultimately resulting in a sale to Google.
? Sadly in our opinion and the opinion of others eBay does not have years to wait. PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google, Apple, Visa, etc. To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal. PayPal must be separated NOW so that great management can be attracted - management that can make the right decision and know when to sell at the right time, not the worst time.
CONCLUSION
The true owners of eBay cannot and should not tolerate any longer the behavior exhibited by CEO John Donahoe and the board as detailed above. We believe that eBay is the quintessential example of what is wrong with corporate governance at many of our public corporations and why the system is dysfunctional. If we, as stockholders, do not send a clear message to the eBay board that we will no longer tolerate the internecine relationships that have come to be accepted as commonplace at eBay, and perhaps more importantly, if we continue to follow the advice of Donahoe, even in light of the transgressions regarding Skype as well as the other failures outlined above, and allow him to continue to lead both eBay and PayPal, and if PayPal fails (as Elon Musk and others far more knowledgeable than me have warned), then investors that own shares in the institutions and funds that control the voting of eBay stock will have every right to cast the blame on everyone who failed to vote for change at eBay.
THE TIME HAS COME TO SEND THE EBAY BOARD A MESSAGE THAT THERE WILL NO LONGER BE BUSINESS AS USUAL AT EBAY! VOTE FOR OUR PRECATORY PROPOSAL AND FOR OUR DIRECTOR NOMINEES.
Sincerely,
<<<<23

Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has been pitted against Michael Dell in a battle over the future of the PC maker.                                                                   (REUTERS)
Carl Icahn sunk his teeth deeper into eBay ( EBAY ) Monday, claiming to have evidence showing CEO John Donahoe s  incompetence  cost shareholders $4 billion.
Continue Reading Below
This comes as the eBay board rejected Icahn s two board nominees, employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, saying both were unqualified and urging shareholders to vote against them at its upcoming annual meeting.
eBay founder and chairman, Pierre Omidyar, urged company stockholders to support the company s nominees, a list that includes Donahoe.
Icahn, the billionaire investor who upped his stake recently in eBay, says he has uncovered  indisputable  evidence related to Donahoe s handling of eBay s 2009 Skype deal, which has been of much debate between the two parties in this escalating spat.
The online marketplace sold the Internet telephone and video service to an investor group that included director Marc Andreessen s venture capital firm in a move that valued it at $2.75 billion. Just years later, Skype was sold to Microsoft ( MSFT ) for $8.5 billion.
 We believe based on evidence we have newly uncovered that Donahoe s inexcusable incompetence cost eBay stockholders over $4 billion,  Icahn said.

He says Donahoe oversaw a  premature  sale of Skype at a diminished price by selling a controlling interest to Andreessen rather than resolving outstanding litigation between eBay and Skype s founders, which apparently caused Microsoft to initially walk away from the deal in 2009.
Andreessen, Icahn claims, then resolved the outstanding licensing litigation and flipped Skype to Microsoft for nearly triple the price -- a roughly $4 billion spread Icahn claims should have been paid to eBay s shareholders.
 The obvious unanswered question is: why didn t Donahoe, who allegedly also had the information that would be key to reaching a settlement with Skype s founders, settle it for eBay and sell Skype directly to Microsoft, thereby keeping the extra $4 billion for eBay stockholders?  Icahn said.
The investor once again urged eBay shareholders to reconsider Donahoe as CEO, or  at the very least  send a message that they are  very unhappy  with the current situation at eBay. He also continued to call for an immediate PayPal spinoff, saying he believes there would be a  number of bidders  willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal.
In response to Icahn s criticisms, Donahoe said eBay got the  highest value at the time  for Skype and that Andreessen recused himself throughout the Skype process despite Icahn s criticisms that there were conflicts of interest that led to a mishandling of the deal.
On Friday, Andreessen issued a public letter calling out Icahn for his own conflicts of interests related to his unrelated investment in XO and purchase of the telecom giant s wired business.
 Carl Icahn 2014 would take a dim view of the business ethics of Carl Icahn 2005,  Andreessen wrote in the letter.
Shares of eBay fell more than 1.5% to $58.14 in recent trade. They are up about 9.5% over the last 12 months.

EBay rejects Icahn board nominees, asks investors to do same

EBay Inc on Monday rejected activist investor Carl Icahn's two nominees to its board, saying both were unqualified, and urged shareholders to vote against them at its next annual meeting.
Icahn, who owns just over 2 percent of the e-commerce company, has been pressuring eBay for weeks to spin off its PayPal payments business. He has also repeatedly accused eBay of poor corporate governance.
The billionaire nominated Icahn Enterprises LP employees Daniel Ninivaggi and Jonathan Christodoro, both of whom Icahn regularly nominates to boards.
The chairman of eBay's corporate governance and nominating committee, Richard Schlosberg III, said the board considered both but rejected them because "neither nominee has relevant experience or expertise."
EBay said since each Icahn nominee currently sits on four public company boards, they are not in compliance with eBay's guidelines on "overboarding."
EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar in a statement urged shareholders to support the company's slate, which includes Chief Executive John Donahoe.
The company also said Donahoe's 2013 compensation fell by more than half to $13.8 million. That largely reflects the board's decision in 2012 to give him a one-time award of $14.8 million in performance share units, although eBay's weaker-than-expected financial performance also hurt his pay.
The company did not in its preliminary proxy statement set the date for its next annual shareholders meeting, which is expected to take place in the spring.
Icahn has sparred with eBay management via open letters and press releases since January, when the pugnacious billionaire made an unsolicited proposal for eBay to hive off PayPal.
The company has repeatedly said PayPal and eBay are better off as part of the same company.
In a fresh missive on Monday, Icahn accused Donahoe of "inexcusable incompetence" and said the fast-growing PayPal could "wither" if it remains part of eBay.
"PayPal may well go the way of other former technology greats such as Blackberry, Dell, Eastman Kodak, Polaroid, Nintendo, Xerox, Sony, Palm, and AOL," Icahn said.
EBay called Icahn's comments "false and misleading."
"In pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John," eBay said.
EBay shares fell 1.4 percent to $58.22 on the Nasdaq.

eBay Rejects Carl Icahn's Board Nominees And Says His Attacks Are 'False And Misleading'

Carl Icahn
For the last several weeks, a firestorm has been raging between eBay and activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been blasting the company's CEO and its board members, particularly the famed Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen.
In his letters, Icahn has also been making two demands: That PayPal spin-off from eBay and that two of his employees join the company's board.
Not only has CEO John Donahoe staunchly insisted that the two company's will not split, but today eBay rejected both of Icahn's board member nominees in its preliminary proxy statement for its annual meeting.
eBay's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommended Scott Cook to serve as a board member again. In his letters , Icahn had insisted multiple times that Cook, co-founder of Intuit, shouldn't be on the board, because Intuit is a long-term competitor of PayPal.
eBay's other board nominees are Elevation co-founder Fred Anderson, former CEO of Agilent Technologies Edward Barnholt, and John Donahoe, eBay's president and CEO.
In his latest letter to the eBay's board this morning , Icahn writes that Donahoe has cost shareholders $4 billion because of his incompetence.
eBay responded by accusing Icahn of a "false and misleading" attack:
John Donahoe has delivered astounding results for eBay shareholders since he became CEO in 2008. In the five years since John's first analyst day, eBay's stock price has increased more than 460%, significantly outpacing both the Nasdaq and the overall market. John's track record of success at eBay, driving the company's turnaround and growth, is well documented. Yet in pursuit of his own profit motives, Carl Icahn has made another unsubstantiated attack on John. Just like his previous ones, this attack is false and misleading and has already been utterly discredited by the facts.

EBay plans to ask its shareholders to reject a slate of board nominees proposed by shareholder activist Carl Icahn , raising the stakes in the billionaire's public battle over the online auction giant's corporate governance.
Last month, Icahn nominated two of his employees to eBay's board, which he has accused of putting its interests ahead of the company. On Monday, eBay released a preliminary proxy statement urging shareholders to reject Icahn's nominees.

In a new salvo , Icahn said that CEO John Donahoe, by selling Skype prematurely, had cost shareholders more than $4 billion. Icahn insists that eBay spin off its lucrative PayPal platform an idea dismissed the company has dismissed.
"PayPal is a great company, but it is going to war against strong adversaries such as Google , Apple , Visa , etc," the billionaire wrote in an open letter on Monday.
"To win a war, you need to have great generals that have proven their competence and loyalty. Unfortunately, it is obvious to us that this is lacking at eBay and PayPal.

Icahn alleges that John Donahoe cost eBay $4bn when he sold Skype in 2009, in what he called a "premature sale" at a "diminished price."
The investment guru struck out at what he called Donahoe's "inexcusable incompetance."
He reiterated his call for the separation of eBay and payments company PayPal .
Icahn has promised to share with stockholders in-depth analysis of what he considers the "sordid affair" regarding the Skype sale.
He concluded the letter:

Carl Icahn has again posted an open letter on his website, Shareholders  Square Table , about eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and the ongoing conflicts of interest he sees with the company s board members. He said he has uncovered new evidence which he says makes his assertion that shareholders lost billions on the Skype deal indisputable.

Skype sale resulted in eBay shareholders losing
The activist investor blames CEO John Donahoe for overseeing  a premature sale of Skype at a diminsted price,  which he says resulted in eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) shareholders losing more than $4 billion compared with how much Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) paid for the VoIP service provider. Icahn believes Donahoe would be fired if eBay was a private company and the  facts  about this were disclosed.
Donahoe decided in 2009 to sell Skype after receiving offers from  multiple bidders.  Icahn isn t sure whether there were  multiple bidders,  which eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) originally said or whether the company contacted a number of buyers, which the auction site now claims. The activist investor believes Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was  clearly interested in buying Skype but  walked away  because of concerns over technology licensing litigation between eBay and Sky e founders. 
Icahn uncovers new documents
Icahn said they discovered new litigation documents in which Donahoe and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) board member Marc Andreessen learned about a workaround of the licensed technology which caused Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to walk away. He states that Andreessen bought a controlling interest in Skype at that point for $1.9 billion, then settled the licensing litigation and  flipped Skype to Microsoft for $8.5 billion tripling their money in only 18 months.  The activist investor questions why Donahoe didn t settle the issue and then just sell Skype directly to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).
He then made the case for why PayPal should be separated from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), suggesting that there would be  a number of bidders willing to pay a large premium for an independent PayPal  and that if the payment services provider is left under eBay s management, then it could  wither,  like BlackBerry Ltd (NASDAQ:BBRY) (TSE:BB), Dell, Nintendo and other technology companies.
eBay launches its own website
Donahoe has maintained that they should keep PayPal as a subsidiary, and his company launched a website  bettertogether.ebayinc.com  which puts forth his case for why the two companies should remain together. On the site, the company states that PayPal has grown faster with the auction site and that it generates about 30% of PayPal s new users. The company also states that the auction site speeds up PayPal s success and makes it  smarter.  In addition, it states that it funds the services provider s growth.

McDonald's sales dip amid shifting eating habits, worsened by snow

McDonald's saw a key sales figure drop in the U.S. again last month as the world's biggest hamburger chain struggles to beat back competition and adapt to changing eating habits.

McDonald's game plan to win back customers
NEW YORK   McDonald's is fighting to hold onto customers in the U.S.   and all that snow didn't help.
The world's biggest hamburger chain said Monday that sales fell 1.4 percent at established U.S. locations. It blamed the harsh winter weather, but conceded that "challenging industry dynamics" also played a role.
After years of outperforming its rivals, McDonald's has been struggling to boost sales as people increasingly flock to places like Chipotle and Five Guys Burgers and Fries. Those chains have popped up quickly across the country by positioning themselves as a step up from traditional fast food, for a little extra money. They also offer greater customization, meaning diners can dictate exactly what toppings they want.
Executives at McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., acknowledge Americans' changing eating habits.
"A long time ago, mass appeal had to be mass appeal," Jeff Stratton, the president of McDonald's USA said in an interview with The Associated Press last month. "That's not necessarily the case anymore today."
The restaurants are adapting to a world where McDonald's traditional strength   consistency   isn't always enough.
For example, McDonald's is rolling out new prep tables that can hold more toppings and sauces, a sign that it plans to give customers greater variety.
In Southern California, the company is even testing a "build-your-own-burger" concept that lets people use tablets to tap out the bread, cheese and other toppings they want on their burgers. Executives say results are promising so far, but rolling out the offering across its more than 14,000 U.S. locations would require considerable changes to kitchens.
In the meantime, McDonald's has made other changes to its menu, including the option to get egg whites in breakfast sandwiches, and the rollout of chicken McWraps, which are intended to appeal to people who want fresher, healthier food.
Comment on this story
Globally, McDonald's said sales declined 0.3 percent at locations open at least 13 months in February. It warned that its muted performance so far this year could hurt first-quarter profit margins.
In region encompassing the Middle East, Africa and Asia, sales declined 2.6 percent. The company cited weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as a shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.
Europe was a relative bright spot, with sales up 0.6 percent on a strong performance in the U.K. and growth in France.
McDonald's has more than 35,000 locations in more than 100 countries.
Its stock shed 31 cents to $95.19 in morning trading.

The same-store sales results of McDonald s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) declined 0.3% in February as the company experienced weakness in the United States and Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa (APMEA).
According to the largest fast food chain operator, the sales performance of its segments in the United States and APMEA dropped 1.4% and 2.6% respectively while its segment in Europe rose 0.6%.
McDonald s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) is experiencing challenges trying to increase its sales performance , particularly in the United States. Last January, the sales performance of the company s U.S. fell 3.3%. CEO Don Thompson previously stated that McDonald s needs to improve its menu offerings as it became less relevant to some customers.
McDonald s growth priorities
Today, Thompson reiterated that the growth priorities of McDonald s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) globally include optimizing menus, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening the accessibility to McDonald s brands. According to him, these priorities are the foundation of the company s customer-centric approach in building its business over the long-term.
 We are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald s each day,  added Thompson.
Severe weather conditions
McDonald s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) explained that its U.S. sales was impacted by challenging industry dynamics and severe weather conditions last month. In APMEA, its sales were affected by weakness in Japan and Australia, as well as the shift in the timing of the Chinese New Year.
On the other hand, the largest food chain operator said its positive sale performance in Europe was due to the continued strong sales in the United Kingdom and France, which offset the ongoing weakness in Germany. McDonald s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its European segment is benefiting from its local menu options, expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours.
Peter Bensen, chief financial officer at McDonald s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) said its relatively flat global comparable sales year-to-date will pressure margins in the first quarter. He emphasized that the company is  diligently strengthening  its performance, and he is confident that the management is taking the right actions to clearly align with customer s needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitability.

Yet another disappointing sales report was released by McDonald s ( NYSE:MCD ) Monday, which begs the question: will we ever see upbeat McDonald s sales results again? According to Bloomberg, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company said that sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in February, reflecting the fourth straight month of sales slumps for its U.S. business. Domestic same-store sales slid 1.4 percent, while analysts expected a 0.6 percent decline. The same-store sales metric is generally considered a good indicator of a company s health, because the figure doesn t take into account the volatility of newly opened or closed locations.
In Europe, same-store sales rose 0.6 percent, and fell 2.6 percent in McDonald s Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa region, according to Bloomberg. McDonald s attributed its strong performance in France and other markets in Europe to its breakfast foods and extended hours, but although the world s largest fast food chain has also pushed its breakfast offerings in the U.S., in that market, its sales continue to suffer.
McDonald s blames its flattened demand in the U.S. on precarious consumer confidence and a stormy winter that has kept many U.S. businesses from prevailing, but even before the wintry winds blew in, it s safe to say McDonald s was already hurting. The company has released quarter after quarter of disappointing sales on account of health-conscious consumers no longer showing an interest in the chain s fatty fare, or eating out in general. That s a reality it has continued to work to upend.
Following its latest report, McDonald s shares were down 0.37 percent at $95.14 as of 10:30 a.m. Monday. According to Bloomberg, McDonald s stock fell 1.6 percent this year through last Friday. Investors and analysts have recognized McDonald s disconcerting performance in the U.S. and pushed for changes, but even with the chain s many menu item launches and promotional deals, it has shown an inability to offset the losses. McDonald s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen even warned investors of McDonald s continuing struggles in the future, and said Monday via Bloomberg that little-changed global comparable store sales so far in 2014 will pressure margins in McDonald s first-quarter. The company is scheduled to report earnings on April 22.
As of now, McDonald s can place some of the blame for its disappointing sales on the current state of the U.S. economy and the frigid weather many consumers have had to combat, but not all can rightly be distributed, considering the chains s competitors have also had to navigate the country s current economic status and have somehow survived. Though, as highlighted by Bloomberg, Tesley Advisory Group analyst Peter Saleh says,  Weather was definitely an impact in the month of February,  he also points out that,  The other players from Wendy s to Jack in the Box to Sonic to Burger King have just improved their game a little bit and they re taking back some of the share. 
So, why can these chains continue to perform modestly while McDonald s U.S. business deteriorates further? That s not entirely clear, considering McDonald s has already reinvented its Dollar Menu, pushed its popular breakfast items, and debuted its McCafe beverages and $1 coffee. Many analysts expected the chain to start reviving its sales sooner rather than later, but now it appears as though that comeback might come later rather than sooner, after all. McDonald s has to find a way to reinvent itself in its domestic market so that it can begin to enjoy the same optimistic figures it currently sustains in Europe. Can it do it? We shall see.

McDonald's posts weak February sales results

McDonald's ( NYSE:MCD ) shares fell on Monday after reporting disappointing same store sales results for February as U.S. comparable sales declined 1.4% --- the fourth straight month of declines despite aggressive TV promotions during the Olympic Games. 
The world's largest fast food chain said global comparable sales decreased by 0.3% last month, as Europe same store sales increased 0.6% while the metric in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region fell 2.6%. 
International sales have been hurt by weak demand in Australia, Germany and Japan, as well as by a stronger dollar, which makes its food more expensive overseas. 
"We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter," said McDonald's CFO Pete Bensen in a statement announcing the sales figures this morning.  
"Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth."
The company said that systemwide sales globally, which includes sales at all restaurants whether operated by McDonald's or its franchisees, would have increased 2.2% if not for the weight of the stronger dollar instead of a 0.6% decline in February.
The burger chain blamed weakness in the U.S. last month, on top of a same store sales drop of 3.3% in January, on "challenging industry dynamics" and the harsh winter weather, while European sales were bolstered by the U.K. and France, mostly offsetting poor performance in Germany. 
Despite the sales-growth challenges McDonald s is facing, some analysts remain bullish on the stock. Among 28 analysts covering the stock, 43% rate it a buy versus 57% who rank it a hold, FactSet data showed.
Shares of McDonald's were down 0.3% on Monday morning, at US$95.24, stretching year-to-date losses to almost 2%.

McDonald's reports lower U.S. sales amid bitter cold winter

comments
McDonald s, the world s largest restaurant chain, said sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.3 percent in February as its U.S. business slumped for the fourth straight month amid harsh weather.
Analysts estimated a 0.1 percent decline, the average of 15 projections from Consensus Metrix. Domestic same-store sales slid 1.4 percent, Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald s said in a statement today, while analysts anticipated a drop of 0.6 percent in the U.S.
McDonald s, which has more than 14,200 U.S. locations, has been trying to attract Americans with coffee and breakfast foods. The fast-food industry also is struggling with shaky consumer confidence and a severe winter that McDonald s says hurt its U.S. sales last month.
 Weather was definitely an impact in the month of February -- that s going to be a drag on everybody,  Peter Saleh, a New York-based analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in an interview. Also, rival fast-food chains are introducing new items, improving stores and drawing U.S. diners away from McDonald s, he said.
 The other players from Wendy s to Jack in the Box to Sonic to Burger King have just improved their game a little bit and they re taking back some share,  he said.
The shares fell 0.3 percent to $95.20 at 9:44 a.m. in New York. McDonald s slumped 1.6 percent this year through March 7, the most recent full trading day, while the Standard & Poor s 500 Restaurants Index declined 1.7 percent.
Pressuring Margins
Little-changed global comparable-store sales so far this year will pressure margins in the first quarter, McDonald s Chief Financial Officer Peter Bensen said in the statement.
While U.S. consumer sentiment rose in February after declining in January, the economy expanded at a slower pace in the fourth quarter than was previously estimated. Smaller gains in consumer spending, inventories and exports are weighing on the economy and indicate less momentum heading into 2014.
McDonald s, along with other chains, is trying to draw diners and boost revenue in the morning. While it pushes new McCafe beverages and $1 coffees, Starbucks Corp. is revamping its breakfast sandwiches, and Yum! Brands s Taco Bell is rolling out breakfast foods, such as sausage burritos and waffle tacos, to its U.S. stores this month. Burger King Worldwide Inc. also has said it s focused on improving and advertising its morning menu.
European Sales
Same-store sales rose 0.6 percent in Europe and fell 2.6 percent in the company s Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. Analysts estimated drops of 0.1 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, according to Consensus Metrix, which is owned by Kaul Advisory Group in Wayne. Same-store sales declined 8.7 percent in Japan last month.
In February, breakfast foods and extended hours contributed to a  strong performance  in the U.K. and positive same-store sales in France, McDonald s said.
Comparable-store sales are considered an indicator of a retailer s performance because they include only older, established locations. McDonald s has about 35,400 restaurants worldwide and 81 percent of those are franchised.
McDonald s is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 22.

McDonald's performance disappointed in February as the fast food giant weathered harsh competition and cold winter temperatures for lower-than-expected sales, particularly in the United States.
U.S. sales dropped a full 1.4 percent "amid challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather," McDonald's said in a statement Monday. The company's sales were also down 2.6 percent in the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa regions.
"We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter," McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen  said
By contrast, European sales rose 0.6 percent in February thanks to strong performance in the United Kingdom and France, which made up for soft performance in Germany.
McDonald's has seen two years of mediocre sales in the United States due to sluggish economic growth and increased competition.

McDonald's Reports February Global Comparable Sales

Published: Mar 10, 2014 7:58 a.m. ET
Share
OAK BROOK, Ill., March 10, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- McDonald's Corporation today announced that global comparable sales decreased 0.3%in February.  Performance by segment was as follows:
"McDonald's global growth priorities - optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to Brand McDonald's - are the foundation of our customer-centric approach to building our business for the long term," said McDonald's President and Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson.  "We are intent on improving our business performance by thoughtfully evolving our approach to ensure that we are delivering the most compelling value, service and convenience to each of the approximately 70 million customers who choose McDonald's each day."
In February, U.S. comparable sales decreased 1.4% amid challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather.  Across the segment, McDonald's priority remains building guest traffic through improved restaurant operations and customer service, relevant menu news, and strong consistent value offerings to regain momentum.
Europe's comparable sales rose 0.6% in February as a result of continued strong performance in the U.K. and positive results in France largely offset by ongoing weakness in Germany.  Local menu options and expanded convenience through breakfast and extended hours continue to support the segment's performance.
In APMEA, February comparable sales decreased 2.6% primarily due to weakness in Japan and, to a lesser extent, a shift in timing of Chinese New Year and negative results in Australia.  To strengthen performance, APMEA is pursuing customer-focused initiatives to deliver menu variety, increased convenience and branded affordability across the segment.
"We are diligently focused on strengthening our performance, however our relatively flat year-to-date global comparable sales will pressure margins in the first quarter," said McDonald's Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen.  "Looking ahead, we believe that we are taking the right actions to more clearly align with our customers' needs and build momentum to drive long-term profitable growth."
Systemwide sales for the month decreased 0.6%, or increased 2.2% in constant currencies.
 
Definitions
Comparable sales represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. Generally, pricing has a greater impact on average check than product mix. Management reviews the increase or decrease in comparable sales compared with the same period in the prior year to assess business trends.
The number of weekdays and weekend days can impact our reported comparable sales. For the month of February 2014, there was no calendar shift/trading day adjustment as the month included exactly 28 trading days, or four complete weeks, during 2014 and 2013.  In addition, the timing of holidays can impact comparable sales.
Information in constant currency is calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because they believe this better represents the Company's underlying business trends.
Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base.
Upcoming Communications
Pete Bensen, Chief Financial Officer, will speak at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Consumer and Retail Conference at 8:50 a.m. (Eastern Time) in New York on March 11, 2014, and at the RBC Capital Markets' Consumer and Retail Conference at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) in Boston on March 12, 2014.  These presentations will be webcast live and available for replay for a limited time thereafter at www.investor.mcdonalds.com .
McDonald's tentatively plans to release first quarter results before the market opens on April 22, 2014 and will host an investor webcast.  This webcast will be broadcast live and available for replay for a limited time thereafter at www.investor.mcdonalds.com .
About McDonald's

Five years after stock meltdown, most Cleveland-area companies have rebounded nicely
Five years after recession
comments
What a difference five years makes.
Five years ago Sunday, the stock market indexes toppled to their low points of recent times, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 6,547.10 on March 9, 2009 -- less than half of what it had been 17 months earlier. The S&P 500, meanwhile, dipped to 676.53, also far less than half of what it had been in October 2007, when it had soared to 1,565.15.
*  Download the above chart in full-size
Today, the indexes are hitting new highs almost every week, as the Dow stands at more than 16,400 and the S&P is at more than 1,875.
Many of our local companies have enjoyed a similar ride with their stocks in the last five years, as share prices have soared and dividends have increased in many cases.
The chart below looks at the total five-year return of 62 area companies. Most are in Greater Cleveland. A few are outside the immediate region but are of keen interest to local investors, consumers and workers. The total return includes appreciation in the share price and income including dividends. 
So if you invested $1,000 in a stock back in March 2009 and the return since then was 100 percent, you'd have $2,000. If the total return in the last five years was 2,738 percent, as is the case with Polyone Corp. of Avon Lake, your $1,000 investment would now be worth $28,380. 
If you'd invested the same $1,000 with Cedar Fair, parent of Cedar Point, your investment would now be worth $11,240. In many cases, the returns wouldn't be quite so incredible: $1,000 then in J.M. Smucker or Progressive Corp. or A Schulman of Fairlawn would be worth about $3,000 today.
In some cases, the fabulous returns are a reflection of how low the stock has sunk during the financial meltdown of 2008 and early 2009. In other cases, the return reflects how well the company has done since then.
Likewise, at the bottom of the list: In a few cases, the companies haven't performed well in the last five years. 
In other cases, like CBIZ Inc. of Independence, the company's stock price didn't fall much during the meltdown (only about 19 percent) and has gained since then (40 percent), but the growth has been more modest compared with other companies that plummeted and then rebounded. 
In the case of FirstEnergy Corp. of Akron, the electric utility has been undergoing a turnaround after posting big losses in 2012. Your $1,000 investment in 2009 would be worth only $1,070 today.
The five-year returns are through Thurs., March 6; the share prices and year-to-date returns are as of Wed., March 5.

World stocks, copper, oil decline after weak China export data
China s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly 9 months; Wall Street falls
Subscribe to our newsletter.

European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5%, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China s ferocious appetite for raw materials. Photo: Bloomberg
New York: Global stock indexes fell and the prices of copper and oil sank on Monday after surprisingly weak Chinese trade data added to worries about a slowdown in the world s second-largest economy.
China s exports unexpectedly tumbled in February, falling 18.1% from a year earlier and swinging the trade balance into deficit. The data underscored recent concerns about the outlook for China s economy, even though the Lunar New Year holidays were blamed for the slide.
The data put a dampener on risk sentiment, which had been boosted briefly by Friday s stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls report.
China s CSI300 share index plunged 3.3% to its lowest level in nearly nine months. Chinese gloom added to the strain in emerging markets, compounding worries that the US Federal Reserve s reduction in stimulus will greatly curb the flow of money.
 The weak China trade balance data caused some flight to quality on less optimism about the global economy,  said Jeffrey Young , interest rate strategist at Nomura in New York.
Prices on benchmark 10-year US treasuries were last up 3/32 to yield 2.78%.
The commodity-sensitive Australian and Canadian dollars declined, both losing as much as half a percent against the greenback in the wake of the plunge in exports from China.
In the US stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 82.96 points or 0.5%, to 16,369.76, the S&P 500 lost 6.41 points or 0.34%, to 1,871.63 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.561 points or 0.38%, to 4,319.662. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Friday.
Shares of Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 3.2% to $31.16 as the signs of a slowing Chinese economy sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.6%.
European shares, as measured by the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index, closed down 0.5%, hit by declines in shares of mining companies sensitive to China s ferocious appetite for raw materials. A global stock index was down 0.5% and an emerging market stock index was down 1.3%.
German steel maker ThyssenKrupp , down 3%, was among the top losers in Europe as Chinese steel and iron ore futures slumped to their lowest levels ever on concerns about a slowdown in China, the world s top commodity buyer.
 Any poor news from China is always going to hit short-term market sentiment, especially in the mining sector, and fears of slower growth will hit base metals,  said IPR Capital director Steven Mayne.
Adding to the day s concerns, in Crimea unidentified armed men fired in the air as they moved into a Ukrainian naval post, in the latest confrontation since Russian military groups seized control of the Black Sea peninsula.
Russia said the US had spurned an invitation to hold new talks on resolving the crisis.
On Wall Street, Boeing Co. shares lost 2.3% to $125.62 and were the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said late Friday that  hairline cracks  had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company s newest jet.
Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an  unprecedented aviation mystery,  a senior official said on Monday.
Shares of Freescale Semiconductor were down 1.7% at $23. Twenty Freescale employees were on the missing Malaysian plane, mostly engineers and other experts working to make the company s chip facilities in Tianjin, China, and Kuala Lumpur more efficient, said Mitch Haws , vice-president, global communications and investor relations.
Chinese Data Weighs On Australian, Canadian Dollars
The Aussie traded 0.4% lower at $0.9031, while the loonie was down 0.2% at $1.1104.
 The Chinese export numbers are the main driver this morning you can see that the Aussie and Canadian dollars are both under pressure,  said Alvin Tann , strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.
The yuan earlier fell as much as 0.5% and Chinese short-term rates dropped after another low daily yuan rate from China s central bank added to speculation Beijing is quietly easing monetary policy to buttress wobbly growth.
The US dollar held steady against major currencies, supported by hopes that the US job growth would pick up in the wake of last week s mildly encouraging report on hiring. The dollar index was little changed at 79.75.
In the metals markets, three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange closed at $6,649 a tonne from $6,782 at the close on Friday. It earlier slid as low as $6,608 a tonne, its weakest since 25 June and within a hair of nearly three-year lows.
Adding to the pressure was China s imports of unwrought copper, which fell 30% in February from January due to weak Shanghai copper prices. Imports were still up 27% from last year s levels.
The Chinese data also weighed on oil. Brent crude was trading 79 cents lower at $108.23. The US oil fell $1.25 to $101.33 a barrel. Reuters

Earnings Season And the Dow: An Early Look
With Nike kicking things off next week, many see the upcoming earnings season as pivotal. Find out why.
Dan Caplinger
( TMFGalagan )
Mar 10, 2014 at 12:30PM
Today, the stock market opened lower on fears of global economic sluggishness, with the Dow Jones Industrials ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) falling 72 points as of 12:30 p.m. EDT and the S&P 500 declining from Friday's record close. Yet in light of the longer-term trends that helped the Dow's bull market reach the ripe old age of 5 yesterday, many investors are looking forward to the beginning of the first-quarter earnings season for signals about whether the blue-chip index has further to climb in the months and years ahead.

Will winter ever end?
The main storyline that most investors have followed closely during the first quarter is the impact of harsh winter weather on the economy. Already we've seen countless companies cite weather problems to justify sluggish results, with even major producers citing issues that could hurt first-quarter earnings. For instance, automaker Ford ( NYSE:F ) said last week that delays in fleet orders due to the winter weather played a sizable role in the company's overall 6% drop in total sales in February from year-ago levels. Many retailers have issued similar warnings, with the latest earnings insight report [opens PDF] from FactSet revealing that 86 companies in the S&P 500 have given negative guidance on first-quarter earnings per share.
On the whole, earnings growth for the first quarter is now seen coming in at just 0.5%, down from expectations of 4.4% at the beginning of the year. Consumer-discretionary stocks such as Ford and General Motors ( NYSE:GM ) have seen some of the biggest downward revisions, with GM cutting its earnings estimates nearly in half. Among S&P sectors, only utilities have seen higher expected earnings growth, and those stocks obviously aren't included in the Dow Industrials. Yet in the past, a recurring theme has played itself out over and over again: earnings expectations fall in the period leading up to the time at which companies actually start to report results, but then companies are able to beat those modest expectations, sending actual earnings growth higher by the end of earnings season.
From that perspective, the early reporting companies in the Dow will have a lot of insight to give to investors. Nike ( NYSE:NKE ) reports next week, and investors expect to see a substantial rise in sales accompanied by a slight decline in earnings from year-ago levels. Those results would be very much in line with what retailers reported recently, as heavy promotional activity has hurt margins. Even though Nike's strong brand value should help it maintain revenue growth more easily than some competitors, even the athletic-apparel giant has to deal with shoppers who don't want to venture into the cold.
Bank stocks will also be among the earliest to issue earnings numbers, with JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE:JPM ) slated to report on April 11. Banks will have lower hurdles to overcome, as investors already expect headwinds from falling levels of mortgage refinancing to have substantial year-over-year impacts on earnings. Yet housing has been relatively resilient so far, raising the hope that new-purchase mortgages can pick up the slack and help boost overall earnings. With financial stocks among the leaders of the latest push up for the Dow, JPMorgan and its peers need to deliver on their promise in order to keep the bull market going.
Are markets too expensive?
The other question earnings season should help answer is whether the Dow has simply risen too far. After such strong gains since 2009, concerns about extreme valuations for stocks have risen to new heights. Yet in driving prices higher, earnings have also posted substantial gains, with forward earnings estimates almost doubling since the 2009 lows. Indeed, FactSet noted that current forward multiples are actually below their 15-year average, albeit with that period including not only inflated late-1990s projections but also the boom markets of the mid-2000s.
Those who would like the 5-year-old bull market to reach its next birthday hope that earnings can keep growing enough to satisfy gun-shy investors who grow more nervous at every new record high. First-quarter earnings season will reveal some useful secrets in determining whether the Dow can keep climbing or whether investors should brace for tough times ahead.

NEW YORK: US stocks Monday fell in early trade following disappointing economic data from China and Japan and continued tension over Ukraine.
About 30 minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 47.92 (0.29 percent) to 16,404.80.
The broad-based S&P 500 dipped 2.09 (0.11 percent) to 1,875.95, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.37 (0.01 percent) lower to 4,335.85.
Weekend economic data from China raised questions about the outlook for the world's second largest economy.
Beijing reported weak inflation data and a $23.0 billion trade deficit in February, while analysts had forecast an $11.9 billion surplus.
Meanwhile Japan said its economy grew more slowly in the fourth quarter, 0.2 percent, than the previously reported 0.3 percent.
Investors are also skittish over tensions between Russia and the West after Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted that Crimea had the right to join his country.
McDonald's became the latest big company to cite cold weather as a factor in diminished sales, saying frigid temperatures in the US were a factor in a 1.4 percent drop in comparable restaurant sales in February. Shares of the Dow component dipped 0.4 percent.
Boeing fell 1.9 percent after Japan Airlines Sunday said its Dreamliner jet made an emergency landing in Honolulu reportedly due to a possible problem with its hydraulic system.
The news followed a Friday Boeing disclosure that hairline cracks were found in the wings of some of its 787 Dreamliners that are still in production, due to a manufacturing problem.
Chiquita Brands International announced it was combining with Irish company Fyffes into a global produce distributor with a combined equity value of about $1.1 billion. Chiquita shareholders will own about 50.7 percent of the new company. Chiquita jumped 12.6 percent.
Bond prices were mixed. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury held steady at 2.79 percent, the same level as Friday, while the 30-year edged higher to 3.73 percent from 3.72 percent. Bond prices and yields move inversely.

Disappointing Chinese Trade Data Weighing On Wall Street - US Commentary
Mon, 10th Mar 2014 16:19
WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - After moving modestly lower in early trading on Monday, stocks have seen continued weakness over the course of the trading session. The pullback on the day is partly offsetting the strong upward move that was seen last week.
The major averages have climbed off their worst levels of the day but currently remain in the red. The Dow is down 84.14 points or 0.5% at 16,368.58, the Nasdaq is down 13.14 points or 0.3% at 4,323.08 and the S&P 500 is down 6.72 points or 0.4% at 1,871.32.
The weakness on Wall Street comes following the release of disappointing Chinese trade data, with a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.
With Chinese exports falling 18.1% year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1% increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of nearly USD23 billion compared to a surplus of USD31.9 billion in the same month last year.
Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6% but imports rose 10%, resulting in a 79.1% drop in the trade surplus to USD8.89 billion.
The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9%.
Nonetheless, trading activity on Wall Street has remained somewhat subdued amid a lack of major US economic data following the slew of data released last week.
Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "In the US, the important economic data of the week doesn't come until Thursday's retail sales and Friday's PPI, and with commodity prices at the highest level since October '12, inflation numbers should now be a focus."
A notable drop by shares of Boeing (BA) is weighing on the day, with the aerospace giant falling by 2.5%. Late Friday, Boeing announced that cracks had been discovered in the wings of 787 Dreamliner jets still in production.
Sector News
Amid concern about the outlook for Chinese demand, steel stocks are seeing significant weakness in mid-day trading. The NYSE Arca Steel Index has tumbled by 2.4% to its lowest intraday level in six months.
Housing stocks have also come under pressure on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index down by 1.5%. KB Home (KBH) and Meritage Homes (MTH) are turning in two of the sector's worst performance.
Oil service, defense and telecom stocks are also seeing notable weakness, while most of the other major sectors are showing more modest moves to the downside.
Other Markets
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable weakness during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.8%.
The major European markets have also moved to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index has fallen by 1.1%, the .K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.4% and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.1%.
In the bond market, treasuries are showing a lack of direction amid a quiet day on the US economic front. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by less than a basis point at 2.786%.

Global Growth Worries May Pressure Stocks
3/10/2014 9:35 AM ET
The major U.S. index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Monday, with sentiment suggesting nervousness of traders amid a lack of clarity due to the absence of any major domestic catalysts. Adding to concerns, China reported an unexpected trade deficit, which has triggered global growth concerns. Stocks may go about a consolidation move, with some degree of profit taking most likely to occur.
U.S. stocks extended their advance in the week ended March 7th, as the markets braved the fears generated by the developments in Ukraine and the uncertainty triggered by mixed economic data.
Last Monday, the major averages were hit by geopolitical concerns and closed notably lower. However, with Russia softening their stance, geopolitical worries faded, triggering a substantial rebound by the markets on Tuesday. Amid the release of soft economic data on private payrolls and the non-manufacturing sector, the averages went about in a lackluster manner on Wednesday before closing mixed.
Notwithstanding the release of positive jobless claims data, the major averages closed mixed again on Thursday. The major averages closed mixed once again on Friday, as the simmering Ukrainian crisis and uneasiness over the overbought levels of the markets took the sheen out of the positive non-farm payrolls data.
For the week, the Dow Industrials rose 0.80 percent and the S&P 500 Index climbed 1 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.65 percent.
Among the sector indexes, the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the KBW Bank Index advanced over 3 percent for the week, and the NYSE Arca Airline Index and the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index rose over 2 percent each. Additionally, the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index added close to 2 percent each, while the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index slipped 1.31 percent.
Commodity, Currency Markets
Crude oil futures are sliding $1.46 to $101.12 a barrel after ending almost flat at $102.58 in the week ended March 7th.
Last Monday, crude oil rallied by over $2-a-barrel amid geopolitical concerns. However, the commodity retreated by over $1.50-a-barrel on Tuesday after Russia pulled its troops back from the border.
The commodity fell further, dropping close to $2-a-barrel on Wednesday amid the release of weak private payrolls data. Oil edged up modestly on Thursday. The commodity jumped by over $1-a-barrel on Friday in reaction to the non-farm payrolls report.
Gold futures, which rose $16.60 or 1.26 percent to $1,338.20 an ounce last week, are moving down $1 to $1,337.20 an ounce.
On the currency front, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro in the week ended March 7th, losing 0.53 percent before ending the week at $1.3875. At the same time, the greenback rose 1.45 percent against the Japanese yen to 103.28 yen.
The U.S. dollar is currently trading at 103.35 yen and is valued at $1.3883 versus the euro.
Asia
The Asian markets retreated amid profit taking, as the recent run up and soft Chinese trade data generated negative sentiment. The Chinese market plunged close to 3 percent, and the Japanese and Hong Kong markets also retreated sharply.
Japan's Nikkei 225 average opened lower and declined steadily till the afternoon. Thereafter, the index moved sideways before closing down 153.93 points or 1.01 percent at 15,120. Export stocks moved to the downside, while construction, real estate, pharma and banking stocks found buying interest.
Australia's All Ordinaries languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before closing down 46.20 points or 0.84 percent at 5,431. Material stocks with exposure to the Chinese economy slumped, while energy and financial stocks also came under selling pressure.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 22,265, down 395.56 points or 1.75 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index plunged 58.84 points or 2.86 percent to 1,999, closing below 2,000 for the first time since January 20th.
On the economic front, a report released by Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that Chinese exports declined 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports. Consequently, the trade balance turned to a deficit of $22.98 billion from a surplus of $31.86 billion last year. Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.
Separate data released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that annual consumer price inflation in Chine eased to 2 percent in February from 2.5 percent in January, with the drop coming in line with estimates.
Final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that Japan's fourth quarter GDP growth was downwardly revised to 0.2 percent quarter-over-quarter from the 0.3 percent increase estimated earlier. The downward revision was in line with estimates.
Overall bank lending in Japan was up 2.4 percent year-over-year in February, according to data released by the Bank of Japan. This was down from 2.5 percent in January.
Europe
After a weak start, European stocks recovered in early trading but have turned mixed since then
In corporate news, Bouygues agreed to sell part of its mobile phone network and a portfolio of frequencies to smaller peer Ilaid SA in a deal valued at up to 1.8 billion euros or $2.5 billion. Unilever bought a majority stake in Chinese water purification company Qinyuan Group for an undisclosed amount.
Sentix released the results of its investor sentiment survey, which showed that confidence among investors in the eurozone remained almost unchanged in March. The corresponding index came in at 13.9 compared to 15 in February.
U.S. Economic Reports
The unfolding week's economic calendar is backend loaded, with some first-tier economic data due only in the latter part of the week. The spotlight is likely to be on the Commerce Department's retail sales report for February, the weekly jobless claims report and preliminary results of the consumer sentiment survey by Reuters and the University of Michigan.
The Commerce Department's wholesale and business inventories reports for January, the Treasury Budget for February, the Labor Department's import and export prices data for February, the producer price inflation report for February and Treasury auctions of 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds round up the economic events of the week.
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser is scheduled to speak on monetary policy, banks and protectionism in Paris at 4:45 am ET. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak on the economy and monetary policy in Columbus, Georgia at 12:40 am ET.
Stocks in Focus

The company now expects comparable store sales growth of 1.7 percent compared to its previous guidance of 2-4 percent growth.  The company also lowered its fourth quarter earnings guidance to $1.57-$1.61 per share from $1.60-$1.67 per share.

Stocks continued to pare losses Monday afternoon as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting that starts tomorrow and key economic data later this week.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were off 0.2%. Volume was down 18% on the Nasdaq and was little changed on the NYSE compared to the same time Friday.
Russian Internet portal Yandex ( YNDX ) took the biggest hit among IBD 50 stocks, sinking 4%. Company co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Ilya Segalovich died Sunday of cancer after slipping into a coma last week. He was 48.
Elsewhere, Chinese Internet portal Sohu.com ( SOHU ) plunged 9% on weaker-than-expected Q2 revenue. Volume was huge as the stock sliced through its 50-day line and fell 8% below a 68.41 buy point of an irregular base. That was enough to trigger a key IBD sell rule for investors who bought at the breakout.
SouFun Holdings ( SFUN ), another Chinese stock, fell 6% after hitting a new high Friday. But it's still extended 22% from a 27.90 buy point.
The real-estate listings website triggered the eight-week hold rule earlier this month after jumping more than 20% above the buy point in less than three weeks. Stocks that rise that much within three weeks of a breakout should be held for at least eight weeks because they're potential big winners.
On the upside, IBD 50 stock Actavis ( ACT ) climbed 1% to a new high in heavy volume, adding to its breakout from a 133.10 buy point. On Friday, the developer of generic and branded drugs said Q2 profit rose 42%, edging above expectations, on a 47% jump in sales. Both figures were the best in five quarters.

S&P dips after record; China data, Boeing weigh
US stocks dipped today, weighed down by soft data out of China and Boeing's latest production setback.
Merger and acquisition announcements, however, as well as company-specific news including on Facebook and Alexion Pharma, helped keep the S&P 500 and Nasdaq from bigger losses.
China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

The S&P 500 had closed at a record of 1,878.04 on Friday.

The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed 0.4 percent lower at 1,320.98 points after re-testing a low set last week earlier in the session, in a broad sell-off involving most sectors.

Stock Market News for March 10, 2014 - Market News
March 10, 2014, 10:06:01 AM EDT By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

Benchmarks ended Friday's trading session on a mixed note. The S&P 500 and Dow gained modestly on the back of better-than-expected nonfarm payroll data. These marginal gains were strong enough for the S&P 500 to hit another record high for the second consecutive day. Investors were also kept on the edge by recent developments in the Crimea region; leading to a volatile trading session.
For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today's Ahead of Wall Street article
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.2% to close Friday's trading session at 16,452.72. The Standard & Poor (S&P 500) edged up 0.1% to finish at 1,878.04. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 4,336.22. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped 0.7% to settle at 14.11. Total volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.5 billion shares. Advancing stocks were outnumbered by declining stocks on the NYSE. For 41% stocks that advanced, 56% declined.
For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 1.0% and the Dow posted a gain of 0.8%. The Nasdaq gained for the fifth-straight week and has improved 0.7% since last Friday. The benchmarks managed to remain in the positive territory through the week as tension between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea region subsided. Following these developments, investors have been confident enough to invest in equities rather than traditional safe-haven assets.
The new agreemenmt between The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS ) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ: DISH ) has added to the bullish mood. The European Central Bank and the Central Bank of United Kingdom's decisions to not change the key lending rates were welcomed by investors. There were mixed reports on the economic front; which investors overlooked as an outcome of the bitter winter season.
Coming back to Friday's events, US stocks began the day on an upbeat note following a better-than-expected nonfarm payroll report for February. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payroll employment had risen to 175,000 in February from 129,000 in January. The rise came despite the harsh winter weather. The increase was more than the consensus estimate of a jump to 152,000.
This report from the Labor Department pushed the S&P 500 to an intraday record of 1,883.57. However, the benchmarks gave away some of the gains as investors remained apprehensive about the US Federal Reserve's next possible move following better jobs data. The Fed's next  policy meeting will take place later this month.
The Labor Department also reported that unemployment rate had edged up to 6.7% in February from 6.6% in January. This rise in unemployment rate was the first increase in 14 months and was more than the consensus estimate of it remaining flat at 6.6%.
Meanwhile, consumer credit increased 5.3% or $13.7 billion in January according to the Federal Reserve. However, the increase in the indicator of potential future spending levels was slightly less than the consensus estimate of an increase by $14 billion.
Separately, the Department of Commerce reported a deficit in goods and services of $39.1 billion in January, up from revised $39.0 billion in December. This rise in the country's largest component of balance of payments was also more than the consensus estimate of $37 billion.
Investors also kept an eye on the developments in the Crimea region where a referendum on whether or not to split the region from Ukraine and make it a part of Russia is possibly being prepared. Geo-political concerns surged when Russian President Vladimir Putin turned down a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over movement of Russian troops in the Crimea region.
Five out of ten sectors of the S&P 500 ended in green. Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) led the gains as the sector rose 0.5%. Top holdings from the sector such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE: WFC ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM ), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) and American Express Company and (NYSE: AXP ) increased 1.3%, 0.9%, 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively.
Among the declining stocks, SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) led the decline as the sector fell 0.5%. Key stocks from the sector such as USG Corporation (NYSE: USG ), DR Horton Inc. (NYSE: DHI ), NVR, Inc. (NYSE: NVR ) and Lennar Corp. (NYSE: LEN ) decreased 2.4%. 1.6%. 0.6% and 1.9%, respectively.

Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary
3/10/2014 10:16 AM ET
Stocks have moved modestly lower in early trading on Monday, giving back some ground after trending higher over the past few weeks. The major averages have all moved to the downside, although selling pressure has remained relatively subdued.
Currently, the major averages are posting modest losses, near their lows for the young session. The Dow is down 66.73 points or 0.4 percent at 16,385.99, the Nasdaq is down 6.95 points or 0.2 percent at 4,329.27 and the S&P 500 is down 4.19 points or 0.2 percent at 1,873.85.
The early weakness on Wall Street comes on the heels of the release of disappointing Chinese trade data, with a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.
With Chinese exports falling 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of $22.98 billion compared to a trade surplus of $31.86 billion in the same month last year.
Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.
The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.
Nonetheless, trading activity on Wall Street has remained somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

Steel stocks have moved sharply lower, however, with worries about the outlook for Chinese demand weighing on the sector. The NYSE Arca Steel Index has fallen by 2.2 percent, hitting a five-month intraday low.
Gold, housing and defense stocks are also seeing early weakness, while most of the other major sectors are showing only modest moves.
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable weakness during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.8 percent.
Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.4 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.1 percent.
In the bond market, treasuries are showing a lack of direction amid a quiet day on the U.S. economic front. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is unchanged at 2.79 percent.

The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.
Nonetheless, trading activity on Wall Street has remained somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.
Steel stocks have moved sharply lower, however, with worries about the outlook for Chinese demand weighing on the sector. The NYSE Arca Steel Index has fallen by 2.2 percent, hitting a five-month intraday low.
Gold, housing and defense stocks are also seeing early weakness, while most of the other major sectors are showing only modest moves.
The major averages are currently posting modest losses, near their lows for the young session. The Dow is down 66.73 points or 0.4 percent at 16,385.99, the Nasdaq is down 6.95 points or 0.2 percent at 4,329.27 and the S&P 500 is down 4.19 points or 0.2 percent at 1,873.85.

Wall street edges lower after record
International | 10 March 2014
Chuck Mikolajczak
New York - US stocks edged modestly lower on Monday, and the S&P 500 held near record highs, as investors largely shrugged off unexpectedly weak data in China.
China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.

 We did shrug off the (China data), almost as if was a non-event,  said Peter Kenny, chief executive of Clearpool Group in New York.
 I don't think it's disruptive to the way people are looking at China as an economy that has lost some of its hyperbolic move and that is almost welcome. 
Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 2.6 percent to $31.35 as signs of a slowing China sent London copper to an eight-month low. The S&P materials index lost 0.4 percent.
Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P's 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades.
 That five-year anniversary has given market investors a sense of pause rather than a sense of enthusiasm because there is still this lingering fear that resides in the approach people have with the market - have we come too far, too fast? Are valuations justified?  said Kenny.
In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 67.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 16,385.29, the S&P 500 lost 4.46 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,873.58 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 6.551 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,329.672.
McDonald's Corp slipped 0.3 percent to $95.25 after the hamburger chain reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales.
Boeing Co shares lost 1.9 percent to $126.10 as the biggest drag on the Dow and S&P 500, after the plane maker said on Friday that  hairline cracks  had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company's newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an  unprecedented aviation mystery,  a senior official said on Monday.
Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe's largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world's biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 14.6 percent to $12.42.
United Rentals Inc, gained 3.9 percent to $91.98 after the world's largest equipment rental company said it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.

Bull market celebrates its 5th birthday: But is the party over? Daily Ticker Monday, March 10, 2014
Five years ago today the stock market, reeling from the financial crisis, hit bottom. The Dow (^DJI ) closed at just under 6,500 and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) ended at 676.5. Since March 9, 2009, the Dow and the S&P 500 have more than doubled but how much longer can this rally last?
No one knows the answer, of course, but there are reasons to be cautious. Here are five of them:
1. Tenure: The average bull market lasts about 4.5 years. Only three of the 11 previous bull markets (excluding this one), celebrated a sixth birthday.
2. Valuation: Profit growth is slowing and revenue growth is sluggish, but the price-to-earnings-ratio for the S&P 500 is still strong--about 16 times earnings for the past 12 months. That's near the peak reached in October 2007, just before stocks began their decline during the financial crisis.
3. Margin debt: It's been rising since June and reached a record $488 billion in January. Investors are borrowing to invest, which is a euphoric sign, says Phil Pearlman, interactive editor at Yahoo Finance. And too much euphoria in the stock market is considered a sign of vulnerability. But Pearlman notes that a major reason for rising margin debt is that the cheap cost of borrowing due to extremely low interest rates.
4. The Fed: the U.S. central bank is reducing its purchases of mortgage debt and long-term Treasuries, which have kept long-term rates low and helped fuel the stock market rally. Many strategists say Fed policy is THE key factor for the stock market rally so less Fed asset purchases means less support for the rally.
5. Biotech weakening. Pearlman says biotech stocks have been a leader in the bull market but have been selling off lately. Over the past two weeks the Nasdaq Biotech index (IBB) has fallen 2.3% while the Nasdaq has gained 1.6% and the S&P 500 and Dow are both up about 2%.
Biotechs have been lagging big-cap growth stocks like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Priceline (PCLN) and Netflix (NFLX) , which have also outperformed in the current rally, says Pearlman. "Keep an eye on biotechs and large-cap growth stocks," he warns. "When they [both] start to roll over that would be a second signal that momentum is waning."

Asia Worries Send Stocks Sliding

FOX Business: Capitalism Lives Here

U.S. equity markets stumbled on Monday after weaker-than-expected export data from China spooked Wall Street traders.
Today's Markets
As of 11:56 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 79.4 points, or 0.48%, to 16373, the S&P 500 slumped 6.5 points, or 0.35%, to 1872 and the Nasdaq Composite slid 14.1 points, or 0.32%, to 4322.
The broad S&P 500 closed at yet another record high last week, climbing 1%. The monthly jobs report, which is considered one of Wall Street's most important gauges, showed the American economy added more jobs than expected last month, helping traders shake off worries that the recent bout of weakness was sparked by more than temporary factors. 
A report on Chinese trade, however, once again sparked concerns about the global economy. The world's No. 2 economy saw its exports plummet 18.1% on year-over-year basis in February, compared to expectations they would rise 7.5%. Japan's fourth-quarter growth was also revised down to an annual rate of 0.7% from 1%.

Dow Averaging 3% Since 2000
March 10, 2014, BY Thomas H. Kee Jr - Editor, Stock Traders Daily |
Subscribe to RSS
Recent headlines make you believe that the market has been doing exceptional, and it is had a nice run recently, but let's get real.  The Dow Jones industrial average ( NYSE:DIA ) has barely increased by 3% annually on average since January 1, 2000, and that beats the S&P 500 ( NYSE:SPY ) and NASDAQ ( NYSE:QQQ ) handily.  In addition, if current sentiment has anything to do with it, another major peak may be on the horizon.
Smaller investors are greedier today than they have been in quite a long time.  My business is one that is constantly monitoring these smaller investors, be it through their responses through social media, traditional media outlets, market based financial articles, television, or through the real time trading reports that we publish for individual stocks, and in keeping my finger on the pulse of these smaller investors I often find contrarian indicators that are actionable from time to time. 
This might be one of those times.
The epitome might be a conversation I had with one of my best friends, who said real estate would never fall again.  Clearly, the sentiment on the street is not limited to the stock market, it is based on asset price increases from virtually all asset classes, but my primary business is the stock market, and as stock market investors come across my plate I find that every one of them, with the exception of a very small niche, are actually expecting to get 15 or 20% a year from their stock market investments.
To anyone experienced in this industry, that's an eye opener.  The Dow Jones industrial average is up only 17% since September, 2007 (that all came last year), and it is up only 43% since January 1, 2000 (when I started stock traders daily).  Said another way, the Dow Jones industrial average has averaged about 3% a year since the turn of the millennium, plus dividends of course.
During that time it has had its share of collapses and recoveries, and a resounding similarity occurs after every recovery.  Somewhere near the peak, smaller investors begin to get extremely greedy.  They become overly confident, and they start to throw caution to the wind.  On the other side of the coin, when everything looks ugly, smaller investors get defensive, but in each case that is almost exactly the opposite of what they should be doing.  When everything is ugly, investors should be aggressive and taking positions to buy the market, and when the market is at relative peaks and everyone else is greedy, prudent investors should become defensive.
Given what I know about today's environment, the greedy sentiment on the street today is very similar to the over exuberance that I have been witness to many times during the life span of my business.  The boom and bust cycles are almost predicated on sentiment sometimes, and if that is true this time we will soon see a peak in the market that will last for quite awhile.

  CHARTS: If the S&P 500 repeat past bull runs
Weighing on stocks was a report from China, the world s second-largest economy, over the weekend that showed its exports unexpectedly skidded 18.1% in February over a year earlier. Economists had expected an increase of 5%. The surprise drop also hit copper prices .
 In the short term, China s trade data was disappointing, however, at this point it is unclear how much of it was distorted by the Lunar New Year holiday,  said John De Clue, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
 U.S. equities still remain the market of choice for a lot of international money, which is why we have seen more multiple expansion over the past few weeks,  he added.
Among individual stocks, shares of Chiquita Brands International Inc. US:CQB jumped 11% after the company announced an all-stock merger deal with Fyffes PLC UK:FFY  worth $1.07 billion on Monday.
FMC FMC, +0.00%  shares climbed 6.2% after the company said Monday it will split into two entities by early next year, with one company consisting of FMC s agricultural solutions and health and nutrition units and the other will focus on its minerals business.
Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. CLF, -3.19%  shares dropped 3.8% in the wake of weak data out of China.
Boeing Co. BA, -0.26%  shares fell 1.3% after The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that the company has discovered cracks in some 787 Dreamliner jets , which will lead to a delayed delivery of some aircraft.
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ALXN, +0.18%  shares gained 7.1% after the biopharmaceutical company on Monday raised its 2014 adjusted earnings outlook .
Plug Power Inc. PLUG, +4.85%  shares jumped 25%, adding to last week s gains of 77%. Plug Power last week scored a contract with six distribution centers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.04% and the price target on its shares was boosted by Cowen & Co. analysts on hope of more contracts.
Facebook Inc. FB, +0.19%  shares rose 3.2% after UBS raised the stock s price target to $90 from $72. Analyst Eric Sheridan said Facebook shares are undervalued but is expected to accelerate in value going forward.
In overseas markets, Asian stocks fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.84%  down nearly 3%. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.07%  lost 1%. European markets fell.
Oil prices fell, with April crude US:CLJ4  off more than 1%. Gold prices regained foot and rose.

Futures Pointing To A Lower Open On Wall Street
3/10/2014 8:50 AM ET
With disappointing Chinese trade data generating some negative sentiment, stocks are likely to move to the downside in early trading on Monday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets , with the Dow futures down by 39 points.
The downward momentum for the markets comes following the release of a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.
With Chinese exports falling 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of $22.98 billion compared to a trade surplus of $31.86 billion in the same month last year.
Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.
The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.
Nonetheless, trading on Wall Street may be somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.

3/10/2014 8:50 AM ET
With disappointing Chinese trade data generating some negative sentiment, stocks are likely to move to the downside in early trading on Monday. The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets , with the Dow futures down by 39 points.
The downward momentum for the markets comes following the release of a report from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showing that China swung to a trade deficit in February.
With Chinese exports falling 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports, the report showed a trade deficit of $22.98 billion compared to a trade surplus of $31.86 billion in the same month last year.
Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent, resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.
The data contributed to a significant sell-off by Chinese stocks, with the Shanghai Composite Index plunging by 2.9 percent.
Nonetheless, trading on Wall Street may be somewhat subdued amid a lack of major U.S. economic data following the slew of data released last week.
Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the Lindsey Group, said, "In the U.S., the important economic data of the week doesn't come until Thursday's retail sales and Friday's PPI, and with commodity prices at the highest level since October '12, inflation numbers should now be a focus."
Among individual stocks, shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) may come under pressure in early trading after the household goods retailer warned of weaker than previously estimated fourth quarter results due to adverse weather conditions.
After failing to sustain an initial upward move, stocks turned in a lackluster performance over the course of the trading day on Friday. The choppy trading came despite the release of a relatively upbeat monthly employment report.
The major averages eventually closed mixed for the third consecutive session. While the Nasdaq dipped 15.90 points or 0.4 percent to 4,336.22, the Dow rose 30.83 points or 0.2 percent to 16,452.72 and the S&P 500 crept up 1.01 points or 0.1 percent to 1,878.04.
Nonetheless, the major averages all moved higher for the week due to the substantial rally seen last Tuesday. The S&P 500 jumped by 1 percent, while the Dow and the Nasdaq advanced by 0.8 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively.
In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw considerable weakness during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.8 percent.
Meanwhile, the major European markets are turning in a mixed performance on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index is up by 0.5 percent, the German DAX Index is down by 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is just below the unchanged line.
In commodities trading, crude oil futures are sliding $1.27 to $101.31 a barrel after ending almost flat at $102.58 in the week ended March 7th.  Gold futures, which rose $16.60 or 1.3 percent to $1,338.20 an ounce last week, are edging up $0.30 to $1,338.50 an ounce.
On the currency front, the U.S. dollar turned in a mixed performance last week. The greenback rose 1.5 percent against the Japanese yen to 103.28 yen but fell 0.5 percent versus the euro to $1.3875. The dollar is currently trading at 103.31 yen and is valued at $1.3883 versus the euro.

U.S. futures mixed to lower, Chinese data weighs; Dow Jones down 0.09%

Investing.com -
Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed to a mixed to lower open on Monday, despite the rally created by upbeat U.S. employment data on Friday, as a disappointing trade balance report from China weighed on sentiment.
Ahead of the open, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.09% loss, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.10% fall, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.03% gain.
The Labor Department reported on Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.
However, data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on a year-over-year basis in February, confounding expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.
A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.
The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.
Tech stocks were expected to be active, after chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices surged nearly 6% on Friday when Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said in an interview that the company makes about 30% of its sales from selling chips into devices other than PCs.
That number is up from about 4% when he joined the company in 2011, according to Read. The companys shares slightly retracted in pre-market trade, down 0.25%.
The energy sector was also slated to be in focus, following reports that BP is now the biggest loser among U.S. government vendors. The oil and gas giant was once the Pentagon's top fuel supplier.
Bloomberg reported that a combination of no big contracts awarded and promised military work withdrawn left BP with a net loss of $654 million in federal contracts in the year that ended September 30, compared with $2.51 billion in awards in fiscal 2012.
Elsewhere, Boeing shares tumbled 1.98% in early trading after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers during a Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8.
Other stocks likely to be in focus included Urban Outfitters, scheduled to report quarterly results later in the day.
Across the Atlantic, European stock markets were mixed to higher. The EURO STOXX 50 climbed 0.58%, France's CAC 40 advanced 0.87%, Germany's DAX slipped 0.11%, while Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.41%.
During the Asian trading session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 1.75%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 Index lost 1.01%.

MARKET ANALYSIS: Global Growth Worries May Pressure Stocks
Mon, 10th Mar 2014 13:35
WASHINGTON (Alliance News) - The major US index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Monday, with sentiment suggesting nervousness of traders amid a lack of clarity due to the absence of any major domestic catalysts. Adding to concerns, China reported an unexpected trade deficit, which has triggered global growth concerns. Stocks may go about a consolidation move, with some degree of profit taking most likely to occur.
US stocks extended their advance in the week ended March 7th, as the markets braved the fears generated by the developments in Ukraine and the uncertainty triggered by mixed economic data.
Last Monday, the major averages were hit by geopolitical concerns and closed notably lower. However, with Russia softening their stance, geopolitical worries faded, triggering a substantial rebound by the markets on Tuesday. Amid the release of soft economic data on private payrolls and the non-manufacturing sector, the averages went about in a lackluster manner on Wednesday before closing mixed.
Notwithstanding the release of positive jobless claims data, the major averages closed mixed again on Thursday. The major averages closed mixed once again on Friday, as the simmering Ukrainian crisis and uneasiness over the overbought levels of the markets took the sheen out of the positive non-farm payrolls data.
For the week, the Dow Industrials rose 0.80% and the S&P 500 Index climbed 1%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index added 0.65%.
Among the sector indexes, the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the KBW Bank Index advanced over 3% for the week, and the NYSE Arca Airline Index and the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer Index rose over 2% each. Additionally, the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index added close to 2% each, while the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index slipped 1.31%.
Commodity, Currency Markets
Crude oil futures are sliding USD1.46 to USD101.12 a barrel after ending almost flat at USD102.58 in the week ended March 7th.
Last Monday, crude oil rallied by over USD2-a-barrel amid geopolitical concerns. However, the commodity retreated by over USD1.50-a-barrel on Tuesday after Russia pulled its troops back from the border.
The commodity fell further, dropping close to USD2-a-barrel on Wednesday amid the release of weak private payrolls data. Oil edged up modestly on Thursday. The commodity jumped by over USD1-a-barrel on Friday in reaction to the non-farm payrolls report.
Gold futures, which rose USD16.60 or 1.26% to USD1,338.20 an ounce last week, are moving down USD1 to USD1,337.20 an ounce.
On the currency front, the US dollar weakened against the euro in the week ended March 7th, losing 0.53% before ending the week at USD1.3875. At the same time, the greenback rose 1.45% against the Japanese yen to 103.28 yen.
The US dollar is currently trading at 103.35 yen and is valued at USD1.3883 versus the euro.
Asia
The Asian markets retreated amid profit taking, as the recent run up and soft Chinese trade data generated negative sentiment. The Chinese market plunged close to 3%, and the Japanese and Hong Kong markets also retreated sharply.
Japan's Nikkei 225 average opened lower and declined steadily till the afternoon. Thereafter, the index moved sideways before closing down 153.93 points or 1.01% at 15,120. Export stocks moved to the downside, while construction, real estate, pharma and banking stocks found buying interest.
Australia's All Ordinaries languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before closing down 46.20 points or 0.84% at 5,431. Material stocks with exposure to the Chinese economy slumped, while energy and financial stocks also came under selling pressure.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 22,265, down 395.56 points or 1.75%, and China's Shanghai Composite Index plunged 58.84 points or 2.86% to 1,999, closing below 2,000 for the first time since January 20th.
On the economic front, a report released by Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that Chinese exports declined 18.1% year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1% increase in imports. Consequently, the trade balance turned to a deficit of USD22.98 billion from a surplus of USD31.86 billion last year. Combining the data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6% but imports rose 10%, resulting in a 79.1% drop in the trade surplus to USD8.89 billion.
Separate data released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that annual consumer price inflation in Chine eased to 2% in February from 2.5% in January, with the drop coming in line with estimates.
Final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office showed that Japan's fourth quarter GDP growth was downwardly revised to 0.2% quarter-over-quarter from the 0.3% increase estimated earlier. The downward revision was in line with estimates.
Overall bank lending in Japan was up 2.4% year-over-year in February, according to data released by the Bank of Japan. This was down from 2.5% in January.
Europe
After a weak start, European stocks recovered in early trading but have turned mixed since then
In corporate news, Bouygues agreed to sell part of its mobile phone network and a portfolio of frequencies to smaller peer Ilaid SA in a deal valued at up to 1.8 billion euros or USD2.5 billion. Unilever bought a majority stake in Chinese water purification company Qinyuan Group for an undisclosed amount.
Sentix released the results of its investor sentiment survey, which showed that confidence among investors in the eurozone remained almost unchanged in March. The corresponding index came in at 13.9 compared to 15 in February.
US Economic Reports
The unfolding week's economic calendar is backend loaded, with some first-tier economic data due only in the latter part of the week. The spotlight is likely to be on the Commerce Department's retail sales report for February, the weekly jobless claims report and preliminary results of the consumer sentiment survey by Reuters and the University of Michigan.
The Commerce Department's wholesale and business inventories reports for January, the Treasury Budget for February, the Labor Department's import and export prices data for February, the producer price inflation report for February and Treasury auctions of 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds round up the economic events of the week.
Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser is scheduled to speak on monetary policy, banks and protectionism in Paris at 4:45 am ET. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak on the economy and monetary policy in Columbus, Georgia at 12:40 am ET.

Stocks futures edge lower on weak Chinese export data
Mar. 10, 2014  9:25 AM ET
|By: Carl Surran , SA News Editor
Stock futures slip as surprisingly weak trade data out of China looks set to stop the market's run to record highs after Friday's upbeat U.S. jobs report; A&P and Dow -0.2%, Nasdaq flat.
Asian markets finished broadly lower, with China's Shanghai Composite -2.9% to a near two-month low on the disappointing trade data; European shares are mixed.
While the Chinese data is of some concern, money manager Kent Engelke says "it's just a good reason for some profit-taking after a great run that we've had... I don't see any great issues that could cause the market to trade down substantially from here."
The Chinese numbers are weighing on the materials sector, as Cliffs Natural -2% and Freeport McMoRan -1.5% premarket.
Treasury enter the session little changed, with the 10-year yield just below 2.79%.

Benchmarks ended Friday s trading session on a mixed note. The S&P 500 and Dow gained modestly on the back of better-than-expected nonfarm payroll data. These marginal gains were strong enough for the S&P 500 to hit another record high for the second consecutive day. Investors were also kept on the edge by recent developments in the Crimea region; leading to a volatile trading session.
For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today s Ahead of Wall Street article
 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) gained 0.2% to close Friday s trading session at 16,452.72. The Standard & Poor (S&P 500) edged up 0.1% to finish at 1,878.04. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.4% to 4,336.22. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) dropped 0.7% to settle at 14.11. Total volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 3.5 billion shares. Advancing stocks were outnumbered by declining stocks on the NYSE. For 41% stocks that advanced, 56% declined.
 
For the week, the S&P 500 advanced 1.0% and the Dow posted a gain of 0.8%. The Nasdaq gained for the fifth-straight week and has improved 0.7% since last Friday. The benchmarks managed to remain in the positive territory through the week as tension between Ukraine and Russia over the Crimea region subsided. Following these developments, investors have been confident enough to invest in equities rather than traditional safe-haven assets.
 
The new agreemenmt between The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Dish Network Corp. (NASDAQ:DISH) has added to the bullish mood. The European Central Bank and the Central Bank of United Kingdom s decisions to not change the key lending rates were welcomed by investors. There were mixed reports on the economic front; which investors overlooked as an outcome of the bitter winter season.
 
Coming back to Friday s events, US stocks began the day on an upbeat note following a better-than-expected nonfarm payroll report for February. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payroll employment had risen to 175,000 in February from 129,000 in January. The rise came despite the harsh winter weather. The increase was more than the consensus estimate of a jump to 152,000.
 
This report from the Labor Department pushed the S&P 500 to an intraday record of 1,883.57. However, the benchmarks gave away some of the gains as investors remained apprehensive about the US Federal Reserve s next possible move following better jobs data. The Fed s next  policy meeting will take place later this month.
 
The Labor Department also reported that unemployment rate had edged up to 6.7% in February from 6.6% in January. This rise in unemployment rate was the first increase in 14 months and was more than the consensus estimate of it remaining flat at 6.6%.
 
Meanwhile, consumer credit increased 5.3% or $13.7 billion in January according to the Federal Reserve. However, the increase in the indicator of potential future spending levels was slightly less than the consensus estimate of an increase by $14 billion.
 
Separately, the Department of Commerce reported a deficit in goods and services of $39.1 billion in January, up from revised $39.0 billion in December. This rise in the country s largest component of balance of payments was also more than the consensus estimate of $37 billion.
 
Investors also kept an eye on the developments in the Crimea region where a referendum on whether or not to split the region from Ukraine and make it a part of Russia is possibly being prepared. Geo-political concerns surged when Russian President Vladimir Putin turned down a warning from U.S. President Barack Obama over movement of Russian troops in the Crimea region.
 
Five out of ten sectors of the S&P 500 ended in green. Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) led the gains as the sector rose 0.5%. Top holdings from the sector such as Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) and American Express Company and (NYSE:AXP) increased 1.3%, 0.9%, 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively.
 
Among the declining stocks, SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) led the decline as the sector fell 0.5%. Key stocks from the sector such as USG Corporation (NYSE:USG), DR Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI), NVR, Inc. (NYSE:NVR) and Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN) decreased 2.4%. 1.6%. 0.6% and 1.9%, respectively.

US STOCKS-Wall St to dip at open after record, China data
* China trade data weak
* McDonald's February same-restaurant sales fall
* Boeing finds cracks in wings of Dreamliners in production
* Futures down: Dow 28 pts, S&P 3 pts, Nasdaq 1 pts
By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK, March 10 U.S. stocks were set to open slightly lower on Monday, on the heels of a record high for the S&P 500, following unexpectedly weak data in China which tempered enthusiasm over the strength of the global economy.
* China's exports unexpectedly tumbled 18.1 percent in February, against expectations for a 6.8 percent rise, swinging the trade balance into deficit and adding to fears of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy, despite the Lunar New Year holidays being blamed for the slide.
* The data put a damper on positive sentiment generated by Friday's better-than-expected U.S. payrolls report, which sent the S&P 500 to a record high for a second consecutive session.
* Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold lost 1.4 percent to $31.74 in premarket trade as concerns over China sent London copper to an eight-month low.
* Sunday marked the five-year anniversary of the S&P's 12-year low of 676.53, when the U.S. economy suffered its worst recession in seven decades.
* In a speech at the Bank of France, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said severe winter weather likely affected U.S. jobs growth in February, the latest U.S. central banker to suggest that some weakness in the labor market was only temporary, which suggested the Fed will stay on course in winding down its stimulus measures.
* S&P 500 e-mini futures slipped 3 points and were slightly below fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures  shed 28 points and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1 point.
* McDonald's Corp reported a bigger-than-expected drop in comparable global sales at established restaurants for February, with competition and bad weather battering U.S. sales.
* Boeing Co shares lost 1.2 percent to $127.06 in premarket trading after the plane maker said on Friday that "hairline cracks" had been discovered in the wings of about 40 787 Dreamliners that are in production, another setback for the company's newest jet. Separately, the disappearance of a Malaysian jetliner, a Boeing 777-200ER, is an "unprecedented aviation mystery," a senior official said on Monday.
* The situation in Ukraine remained unsettled. Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Monday it was outraged by lawlessness in eastern Ukraine, blaming the far-right paramilitary movement Right Sector for "conniving" with the new government in Kiev. Germany's Angela Merkel delivered a rebuke to President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, telling him that a planned Moscow-backed referendum on whether Crimea should join Russia was illegal and violated Ukraine's constitution.
* Chiquita Brands and Irish rival Fyffes, Europe's largest distributor, have struck an all-stock merger deal to create the world's biggest banana supplier. Chiquita shares jumped 18.1 percent to $12.80 in premarket trade.
* United Rentals Inc, the world's largest equipment rental company, said on Sunday it had agreed to acquire privately held National Pump, the second-largest specialty pump rental company in North America, for $780 million.

Stock Futures Dip After Asia Selloff

U.S. stock-index futures slumped mildly after weak China data sparked a selloff in Asian markets.
Today's Markets
As of 8:00 a.m. ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slipped 19 points, or 0.12%, to 16430, S&P 500 futures dipped 1.8 points, or 0.09%, to 1876 and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.7 points, or 0.02%, to 3705.
The broad S&P 500 closed at yet another record high last week, climbing 1%. The monthly jobs report, which is considered one of Wall Street's most important gauges, showed the American economy added more jobs than expected last month, helping traders shake off worries that the recent bout of weakness was sparked by more than temporary factors. 
A report on Chinese trade, however, once again sparked concerns about the global economy. The world's No. 2 economy saw its exports plummet 18.1% on year-over-year basis in February, compared to expectations they would rise 7.5%. Japan's fourth-quarter growth was also revised down to an annual rate of 0.7% from 1%.

Uncertain Mood Prevails On Wall Street
3/10/2014 6:30 AM ET
The trading in the U.S. index futures suggest that the markets may search for direction following their recent run up. The major index futures are pointing to a lower opening on Monday. Earlier in the global trading day, weak Chinese trade data weighed down on Asian stocks, with the Chinese market retreating sharply, while the European markets are trading mixed amid a lack of any directional cues. The domestic markets may also face difficulty in finding their footing amid a lack of any meaningful economic and corporate catalysts.
At 6:15 am ET, the Dow futures are receding 19 points and the S&P 500 futures are moving down 2.10 point and the Nasdaq 100 futures are declining 0.75 points.
U.S. stocks extended their advance in the week ended March 7th, as the markets braved the fears generated by geopolitical concerns surrounding the developments in Ukraine and the uncertainty triggered by mixed economic data.
On the economic front, the unfolding week's economic calendar is backend loaded, with some first-tier economic data due only in the later part of the week. The spotlight is likely to be on the Commerce Department's retail sales report for February, the weekly jobless claims report and preliminary results of the consumer sentiment survey by Reuters and the University of Michigan.
The Commerce Department's wholesale and business inventories reports for January, the Treasury Budget for February, the Labor Department's import and export prices data for February, the producer price inflation report for February and Treasury auctions of 3-year and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds round up the economic events of the week.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans will speak on the economy and monetary policy in Columbus, Georgia at 12:40 am ET.
Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) announced preliminary fourth quarter results to reflect the impact of adverse weather conditions. The company now expects comparable store sales growth of 1.7 percent compared to its previous guidance of 2-4 percent growth.  The company also lowered its fourth quarter earnings guidance to $1.57-$1.61 per share from $1.60-$1.67 per share. The company also said that the estimated impact on net earnings for the first quarter was 6-7 cents per share.
United Rentals (URI) announced an asset purchase agreement to acquire National Pump, along with GulfCo, a two branch rental business also based in Texas, for a purchase price of $780 million. The company expects the deal to be accretive to its free cash flow and earnings per share in 2014.
Casey's General (CASY), FuelCell Energy (FCEL), Novavax (NVAX), Tech Data (TECD) and United Natural Foods (UNFI) are among the companies due to release their quarterly results after the close of trading.
The Asian markets retreated amid profit taking, as the recent run up and soft Chinese trade data generated negative sentiment. The Chinese market plunged close to 3 percent and the Japanese and Hong Kong markets also retreated sharply.
Japan's Nikkei 225 average opened lower and declined steadily till the afternoon. Thereafter, the index moved sideways before closing down 153.93 points or 1.01 percent at 15,120.  Australia's All Ordinaries languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before closing down 46.20 points or 0.84 percent at 5,431.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index closed at 22,265, down 395.56 points or 1.75 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index plunged 58.84 points or 2.86 percent before closing at 1,999, closing below the 2,000 level for the first time since January 20th, 2914.
On the economic front, a report released by Chinese General Administration of Customs showed that Chinese exports declined 18.1 percent year-over-year in February compared to a 10.1 percent increase in imports. Consequently, the trade balance turned to a deficit of $22.98 billion from a surplus of $31.86 billion last5 year. The combined data for January and February to smooth out the volatility caused by the Lunar New Year holidays showed that exports fell 1.6 percent but imports rose 10 percent resulting in a 79.1 percent drop in the trade surplus to $8.89 billion.
Separate data released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that annual consumer price inflation in Chine eased to 2 percent in February from 2.5 percent in January, with the drop coming in line with estimates.
Final estimates released by Japan's Cabinet Office reported that Japan's fourth quarter GDP was downwardly revised to 0.2 percent quarter-over-quarter from the 0.3 percent estimated earlier. The downward revision was in line with estimates.
Overall bank lending in Japan was up 2.4 percent year-over-year in February, according to data released by the Bank of Japan. This was down from 2.5 percent in January.
After a weak start, European stocks have recovered and are currently trading in positive territory.
In corporate news, Bouygues agreed to sell part of its mobile phone network and a portfolio of frequencies to smaller peer Ilaid SA's Free in a deal valued at up to 1.8 billion euros or $2.5 billion. Unilever bought a majority stake in Chinese water purification company Qinyuan Group for an undisclosed amount.
Sentix released the results of its investor sentiment survey, which showed that confidence among investors in the eurozone remained almost unchanged in March. The corresponding index came in at 13.9 compared to 15 in February.

  CHARTS: If the S&P 500 repeat past bull runs
Data over the weekend showed Chinese exports unexpectedly fell 18.1% in February, compared with a year earlier, which left a trade deficit of $22.98 billion for the month. Economists had been expecting an expansion of 5%, and the number was also well off a rise of 10.6% in January.
 The shock drop in exports raises serious questions about how realistic Chinese growth prospects are and casts doubt on their current target,  said Rebecca O Keeffe, head of investment at stockbroker Interactive Investor.  This increased uncertainty is not helpful for either the commodity market or wider global-equity markets. 
Asian markets fell sharply, with the Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +0.84%  down nearly 3%. The Nikkei 225 index NIK, +0.07%  lost 1%. Also coming under pressure were the Australian dollar USDAUD, +0.5215%  and copper prices US:HGK4   the latter fell more than 1%. Oil prices were also sharply lower, with April crude US:CLJ4  off more than 1%.
Stock futures struggled between the flat line and losses, and European markets also traded choppy.
 We think this is just the market trying to weigh out two real stories: The positive numbers from payrolls against Chinese numbers overnight, and it almost seems the positivity of payrolls has won out over China,  said James Hughes, chief market analyst at Alpari U.K.
Some are cautious as the S&P 500 is up more than 170% since its March 9, 2009 low. That string of S&P 500 highs, along with levels of margin debt and a small number of prior bull markets that have made it this far, are among reasons why some investors are wary.
Reuters
Shipping containers are seen piled up at a port in Qingdao, Shandong province in China on Dec. 10, 2013.
Hughes said that markets were also ignoring negative data that arrived in 2008, near the beginning of the euro crisis. While investors will be keeping an eye on geopolitical situations such as Ukraine, at the moment, he said it is just hard to bet against the market.
Shares of Chiquita Brands International Inc. US:CQB jumped 13% in premarket. Chiquita and Fyffes PLC UK:FFY  announced an all-stock merger deal worth $1.07 billion on Monday.
Boeing Co. BA, -0.26%  eased over 1% in premarket after The Wall Street Journal reported late Friday that the company has discovered cracks in some 787 Dreamliner jets , which will lead to a delayed delivery of some aircraft.
McDonald s Corp. MCD, +0.18%  reported a global same-store sales drop of 0.3% and a 1.4% fall for U.S. sales ahead of the open.
Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. BBBY, +0.05%  cut its fourth-quarter earnings-per-share outlook on Friday, blaming bad weather. Shares inched up in premarket.

3 Predictions for the New Week
There are always calls to be made, because the market never sleeps.
Rick Munarriz
( TMFBreakerRick )
Mar 9, 2014 at 3:00PM
I went out on a limb last week , and now it's time to see how that decision played out.
I predicted that RadioShack ( NYSE:RSHCQ ) would post a wider loss than expected. The struggling small-box retailer of wireless products and other consumer electronics was having a hard time keeping its red ink in check in recent quarters, and larger chains had already provided uninspiring snapshots of the niche. Well, the report was brutal. RadioShack's adjusted loss of $1.29 a share was far worse than the $0.13 analysts were forecasting. I was right.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) has been strong lately, but my second prediction still called for the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to outpace the Dow. It was close, but the Dow's 0.8% advance squeaked past Nasdaq's 0.7% gain. I was wrong.
My final call was for Ambarella ( NASDAQ:AMBA ) to beat Wall Street's income estimates in its latest quarter. The provider of system-on-chip solutions for the HD camera industry has been riding high with its handiwork found in GoPro sports enthusiasts' cameras and Dropcam home security products. Ambarella closed out the quarter with an adjusted profit of $0.26 a share. Analysts had been banking on net income of $0.19. I was right.
Two out of three? I can live with that! I have now gone a solid 20 out of 24 over the past eight weeks.
Let me once again whip out my trusty, dusty, and occasionally accurate crystal ball to make three calls that may play out over the next few trading days.
1. Novavax will post a wider loss than expected
Novavax ( NASDAQ:NVAX ) is a widely traded maker of vaccines. It moved higher late last month after extending its contract with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Sciences to develop seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines.
Unfortunately, Novavax is losing money, and analysts seem to underestimate the red ink. Wall Street has failed to nail its projections when it comes to Novavax, aiming for a much smaller deficit than what the vaccine maker ultimately reports.
Why get in the way of a long-running streak? My first call is for Novavax to post a wider quarterly loss than Wall Street's projecting this week.
2. The Nasdaq will beat the Dow this week
I've routinely picked the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average, but I've been switching things out in recent weeks. I'm going back to my original call this time around, betting on a strong week for tech now that earnings season is starting to wind down. This approach didn't pan out for me this past week, but that won't deter me.
My second call is for the Nasdaq Composite to outperform the Dow Jones Industrial Average on the week.
3. magicJack VocalTec will beat Wall Street's earnings estimates
Some stocks are just flat-out better than others.
magicJack VocalTec ( NASDAQ:CALL ) is a provider of Web-based phone services. Consumers looking to save money have been ditching traditional landlines, and the VoIP pioneer has sold 10 million of its magicJack devices.
Another thing it does is make analysts look like perpetual underachievers. If analysts say the company posted a profit of $0.19 a share in its latest quarter, I'll argue that it held up better than that. History's on my side!
One of my best tricks to beating the market is finding stocks that perpetually land ahead of the prognosticators. Let's go over the past year of earnings reports.

The Dow's 5 Most Hated Stocks
The Dow Jones Industrial Average may be near a record high, but short-sellers have been unrelenting with these five components.
Sean Williams
( TMFUltraLong )
Mar 8, 2014 at 7:01PM
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJINDICES:^DJI ) may not be knocking off new all-time highs on a daily basis like the broader market S&P 500, but it is once again with striking distance of a new high as it's rebounded ferociously off its beginning-of-the-year swoon.
Helping the Dow move decisively higher has been a steady recovery in the U.S. economy, aided by a double-digit rise in home prices, a precipitous fall in the unemployment rate, improving worker productivity, and the continuation of historically low lending rates.
But are things really as they appear?
Two months ago we looked at three variables that may be inflating how strong the U.S. economy actually looks. The first is the labor participation rate, which has been falling consistently for the past 14 years. Some of this drop is expected as baby boomers hit their retirement age and others go back to school, but a growing concern is that some people have simply given up on finding work. Comparing the current number of employed workers with those in mid-2008, you'd see that job creation is basically flat.
Second, the Federal Reserve's economic stimulus, QE3, has been a boost for the housing and banking sector, but has spoiled the U.S. consumer by keeping rates too low for too long, By artificially keeping rates low and reducing this sense of urgency, consumers have drastically cut back on loan originations anytime lending rates tick up in the slightest.
Finally, a combination of stock buybacks and cost-cutting has helped push corporate earnings higher, but it's also masking what has generally been weak organic growth.
With these points in mind, I suggest we do what we do every month, which is to take a closer look at the Dow's five most hated companies -- in essence, the five stocks with the highest level of short interest -- to better understand what characteristics, if any, are attracting short-sellers so we can avoid buying similar stocks in the future.
Here are the Dow's five most hated stocks.
Company

Caterpillar
Why are investors shorting Caterpillar?
The bet against heavy-duty machinery manufacturer Caterpillar has grown dramatically within just the past month, rising from 3.46% last month to 5.96% this month. The reason for the recent run higher was its sizable earnings beat in the fourth quarter , which was a complete surprise after Caterpillar had lowered its earnings guidance on three separate occasions last year. Short-sellers are betting that this past quarter, which was aided primarily by cost-cutting, was nothing more than a fluke, and that weak mining demand will continue to weigh on Caterpillar's share price.
Is this short interest warranted?
With Caterpillar's management remaining cautious in 2013 and not exactly knowing when this protracted downtrend in heavy-duty machinery would end, I'd suggest that a high level of skepticism could be warranted, at least in the interim. Over the long run, Caterpillar is well positioned globally and has incredible pricing and brand power, which should translate into decades of growth potential, especially in emerging markets. Over the near term, though, stagnant commodity prices could put a cap on any upside in Caterpillar's share price and play right into the hands of short-sellers.
Patrick Gelsinger, Intel Sr. VP, Source: Intel.
Intel
Why are investors shorting Intel?
The bet against Intel hasn't changed in more than a year now, with pessimists counting on Intel's PC processing business to slowly shrink, and for the company to have to spend heavily on research and development to play catch-up with regard to mobile processing and the cloud. The end result has been stagnant top- and bottom-line growth for Intel, which short-sellers suspect will weigh on Intel's share price.
Is this short interest warranted?
Pessimists do have a point about continued PC declines, with research firm IDC upping its estimate this past week from an expected 3.8% decline in 2014 to 6.1%. Furthermore, IDC anticipates that PC sales will decline through 2018.While that's not good news for Intel, what is good news is that it'll still be able to generate significant cash flow from its dominant position as the processing king of PCs to fund its mobile and cloud-based R&D. Intel has already shown small snippets of success in penetrating the mobile tablet market and should be a major player in cloud-based hardware by the end of the decade. I believe you'd be doing yourself a disservice by writing off Intel here.
AT&T
Why are investors shorting AT&T?
The reason short-sellers have piled into AT&T has nothing to do with poor results. It merely has to do with the risk-on investing approach we're witnessing throughout the market that has traders cycling out of traditionally defensive names like AT&T, which grows at very slow but steady rate, and instead focusing on seeking out riskier but higher-growth investments. In addition, relative to Verizon, AT&T is trailing in 4G LTE-capable cities, meaning it'll have to spend bountifully if it hopes to catch its main rival. 4G LTE is a strong lure in the U.S. to gaining new smartphone subscribers.
Is this short interest warranted?
Somehow this short trade has indeed worked for pessimists over the past year, but I doubt it'll work over the long run. Sectorwide consolidation should help tighten AT&T's costs (AT&T is purchasing Leap Wireless), and mobile devices have practically become necessity products for much of today's consumers. What this means for AT&T is steady cash flow, a healthy dividend that's currently yielding 5.8%, and few reasons to bet against the company .
Verizon
Why are investors shorting Verizon?
Although telecom giants Verizon and AT&T switched spots this month, with AT&T leapfrogging Verizon in a bad way, the story is almost exactly the same for both. Like AT&T, Verizon bears a high number of short-sellers because it's generally a slower-growth business model that simply won't be able to keep up with the double-digit growth traders are witnessing in the networking and cloud-tech space. As investors cycle out of these defensive names, they tend to slowly tick lower.
Is this short interest warranted?
Let me be clear that I don't think betting against AT&T or Verizon is a smart idea, but with the recent acquisition of its remaining unowned interest in Verizon Wireless from Vodafone, coupled with its sizable lead in rolling out 4G LTE-capable networks across the U.S., Verizon makes even less sense than AT&T to bet against. Verizon is paying out a premium 4.4% yield, and at 12 times forward earnings it looks ripe as a possible buy, if you ask me.
IBM
Why are investors shorting IBM?
Are you noticing the major tech bias on this list of the Dow's most hated companies? No. 2 through No. 5 are all tech or telecom based! IBM finds its way onto this list for many similar reasons as Intel. IBM has seen its hardware division get whacked by weakening demand, and, like Intel, has had to beef up its R&D spending to develop new cloud-based products. Pessimists believes that Big Blue may simply have fallen too far behind not to see its EPS erode in the near-term.
Is this short interest warranted?
On the surface, IBM looks like a company that should be avoided as it transitions to a number of new products. However, with the backing of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as a major shareholder, as well as its incredibly strong cash flow, I'd suggest that short-sellers would probably be wise to lock in their gains now and keep their distance. With its forward P/E of just 9 , I've even added IBM to my personal watchlist as a possible buy candidate.

A Secular Bull Market Arises From the 2009 Shadows
Charts and investor psychology both point to a new secular bull market in the S&P 500
By Serge Berger , Head Trader & Strategist, The Steady Trader  |   Mar 10, 2014, 12:13 pm EDT
   
View All Posts
Respect the bear, but never fear it. That s a lesson every investor should take away from the panic of 2009, and it s applicable everywhere   even now, as we sit around all-time highs.
I remember the scene as if it was yesterday: It was Sept. 15, 2008, and investment banking giant Lehman Bros. had just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The S&P 500 fell more than 4.5% on the day, and as I left the office around 6pm after a busy trading day in Manhattan, the streets were quiet   much too quiet for New York City.
On any other day, a sea of yellow cabs greeted me right outside my building in mid-town Manhattan, but not on Sept. 15. I found myself walking a few blocks north just to find a cab. It was eerie. With the financial epicenter of the globe being shaken to the core that day, the fear in the air was palpable.
The market eventually would take the market through a shaky autumn and winter. In fact, it wouldn t be until six months later, while headlines of doom and gloom were still flying faster than ever, that the market began to climb out of the abyss. On March 6, 2009, the S&P 500 finally capitulated to the ironic intraday level of 666, then on March 9, the market hit its closing low point at 676.53. A day later, stocks saw a big follow-through buying day, with the index rallying more than 6%.
As it usually goes, neither the media nor the investing crowd took the March 10 bounce as anything more than a short-lived lift, and those smart enough to buy kept very quiet. But to me, it became clearer that considering the typical six-month lag in which the market works, coupled with the still-paralyzed investing public, at least a medium-term bottom was in place.
I wasn t smart/dumb enough to go all-in on stocks that day either, but because the psychological picture seemed to match up with what I saw on the charts, I knew better not to be caught short the market at the time.
I was right.
Of Bulls and Bears
The general story in terms of bull and bear markets, particularly in the S&P 500, is that roughly every 13- to 17-year bull market is followed by a 10- to 15-year bear. (The Great Depression, depending on when you re measuring from, stands out as an exception.)
So, looking at the below chart of the S&P 500, which spans all the way back to 1927, this rhythm should somewhat stand out. After a flat tape the bear market from the mid- 60s through the early  80s, the S&P 500 began its great bull run. Aside from the crash on Oct. 19, 1987, the bull market really kept running until the dot-com bubble of the late  90s and early aughts popped. This then led to the  lost decade  and the easy monetary policy introduced by then-Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan, during which stocks wildly gyrated and ultimately bottomed five years ago   in March 2009.
Click to Enlarge
Looking at the past 20 or so years of trading in the S&P 500 a little more closely, what stands out on the below weekly chart is that the March 2009 capitulation marginally and classically broke below the index s 2002 lows. This helped to wash out all those players who placed their stop-loss orders around this area, and paved the path for the steep and vicious rally we have witnessed since.
The nail in the coffin for the bears came in spring 2013, when the S&P 500 broke to fresh all-time highs, leaving behind the market tops from 2000 and 2007.
Click to Enlarge
This has, in my opinion, given birth to a new secular bull market   the long 13- to 17-year type of cycle that I discussed above.
However, with the cyclical bull market now five years of age, it is slowly but surely getting somewhat long in the tooth. While many sectors and industries/groups of stocks still look good on the long side, it is somewhat too early to clear the portfolio and or lean short this market. But if history is any guide, then at some point over the next three to nine months, a first cyclical bear market will throw investors a curveball.
The thing to remember when all turns to panic (which it inevitably will) is that if we do indeed find ourselves in a new secular bull market, then the next cyclical bear should lead to a correction no bigger than roughly 30%.
That would mean the major breakout that the S&P 500 staged in spring 2013 when it broke past long-term highs around 1,550 could easily get retested at some point.
And if it does, just remember   the market always bounces back.

U.S. Stock-Index Futures Are Little Changed After S&P 500 Record
By Sofia Horta e Costa, Bloomberg News
Monday, March 10, 2014
Comments
March 10 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock-index futures were little changed, after equities surged to a record, as investors weighed a slowdown in Chinese exports for clues about the strength of the global recovery.
Boeing Co. dropped 2 percent in early New York trading after a 777-200 plane disappeared with 239 passengers and crew during a Malaysia Airlines flight to Beijing on March 8. 3D Systems Corp. lost 3.4 percent and Stratasys Ltd., fell 2.8 percent after Barron s magazine said stocks of the 3D printer makers were overvalued.
Futures on the Standard & Poor s 500 Index expiring this month slid 0.1 percent to 1,876 at 7:17 a.m. in New York, after the benchmark gauge completed a five-year, 178 percent rally. The measure rose 1 percent last week, buoyed by improving hiring and manufacturing data. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 17 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,431 today.
 The health of the global economy is a tale of two parts,  said Teis Knuthsen, chief investment officer at Saxo Bank A/S s private-banking unit in Hellerup, Denmark.  The U.S. will drive global growth this year but a few key emerging markets like China are looking a bit weaker and relatively vulnerable. With extremely expansive monetary policy still in place, developed-market equities are the place to be. After the S&P 500 rose to a new record, valuations are only fair now but investors may be willing to pay higher multiples. 
Stock Valuation
Nine of 10 main S&P 500 groups advanced last week, sending the index to trade at 15.97 times its members  projected earnings. Financial stocks paced the gains, rallying 3 percent to the highest since September 2008. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, a gauge for future volatility known as the VIX, added 0.8 percent last week.
The S&P 500 has rallied 7.8 percent since hitting a three- month low on Feb. 3 amid turmoil in emerging markets from Turkey to Argentina. That restored $1.8 trillion to U.S. equity prices.
Asian stocks retreated from a six-week high today and China s CSI 300 Index dropped to a five-year low after customs data from March 8 showed exports from China fell 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier. That was the largest decline since August 2009. The median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had called for a 7.5 percent increase.
Boeing Co. lost 2 percent to $126.02. Malaysia still had no information about the Boeing aircraft, which was carrying 239 people when it left Kuala Lumpur. A team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board was heading to Malaysia to be in place once the wreckage of the plane is located. The team was being joined by experts from the Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing.
3D Systems fell 4.9 percent to $64.01, while Stratasys declined 2.2 percent to $112.01 in early trading. Barron s said 3D printer stocks look overvalued and that the two companies have  exorbitant  share prices, according to its March 10 issue. 3D Systems trades at 84.2 times its projected earnings, and Stratasys trades at a multiple of 51.9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

NEW YORK  
Happy 5th birthday, bull market.
The current bull run is not the longest, or strongest in history, but it has survived a near default by the U.S. government, a debt crisis in Europe, and a war in Syria.
Despite all the obstacles thrown in its way, this bull market is now the fourth-longest since 1945, according to S&P Capital IQ. The Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 178 percent in the five years since it bottomed out on March 9, 2009.
A bull market is a rise of 20 percent or more over a period of at least six months, following a decline of 20 percent or more. The run-up over the past five years has been helped by stimulus from the Federal Reserve, record corporate profits, the economic recovery and companies repurchasing their own stock.
The current bull had a tough start to 2014. In January, the S&P 500 index fell 3.6 percent on concerns about slowing growth in China and other emerging markets. Investors also worried about the strength of the U.S. economy. This month, the market has been rattled by events in Ukraine, where the region of Crimea is preparing for a referendum on whether to split away and join Russia. President Barack Obama and several other Western leaders have condemned the referendum.
Despite the latest setbacks, stocks recovered and the S&P 500 index closed at a record high of 1,878.04 on Friday.
There have been 11 bull markets since 1945. The longest one stretched for almost a decade, between October 1990 and March 2000. The average bull market lasts 4-1/2 years, making the current one longer than average.
The last bull market ended in October 2007, as the financial crisis was taking hold. The S&P 500 index dropped 57 percent from a record high of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2009, before bottoming out at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.
Typically, bull markets end when investors get spooked by a recession, or anticipate one, and sell stocks. None of that is happening, which suggests this bull may have room to run yet. The economy appears to be strengthening rather than faltering. Corporate profits are at record levels. The job market is gradually improving and consumer confidence is rising.
Inflation also remains low. When the Fed starts to worry about rising prices, it hikes interest rates to curb them. The higher rates can tip an economy into recession and prompt a sell-off in stocks.
But with inflation under control, the Fed has stressed that it plans to keep its key short-term rate near zero for an extended period.
Stock valuations remain in line with historical averages, says John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo Fund Management. The price-earnings ratio for the next twelve months, which measures stock prices compared with forecast earnings, stands at 15.5, slightly below its 20-year average of 16.4.
The stock market is "not cheap, but it's not expensive either, so I think the market continues to move higher until further notice," Manley says.
The bull market's gain is above the average advance of 141 percent for S&P 500 bulls. But it is well short of the 417 percent jump from October 1990 to March 2000.
Here is what's changed since the bull run began:
HERE'S WHAT YOU COULD'VE WON
Since starting its advance in March 2009, the S&P 500 has handed investors a total return, including reinvested dividends, of 209 percent.  If you'd played it safe and invested in bonds, your total return would be 28 percent over the same period, according to the Barclays U.S. aggregate index, which tracks the broader debt market. If you'd played it even safer and invested in short-term government debt, certificates of deposit and other short-term debt securities, your return would be even smaller. Fidelity's money market fund, which makes such investments, returned 4.1 percent over the same period.
BEST PERFORMERS
The best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 index during the five year bull market are a drugmaker, a hotel company and a broadcaster. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is developing an experimental asthma drug, has climbed from $12.40 in March 2009 to $328.11 on Friday. That's a cumulative return of 2,546 percent, making it the best-performing stock since the start of the rally. Wyndham Worldwide, a hotel and lodging company that owns the Ramada and Days Inn, has soared from $3.10 to $75.70 as demand for hotels revives. The company has also raised its dividend. CBS has climbed from $3.09 to $67.40 as advertising revenue increased.
THE LAGGARDS
Among stocks still in the S&P 500 index since the start of the bull market, the worst performers are a solar panel maker, a mining company and a supplier of wholesale electric power.
First Solar's shares are down from $108.36 to $56.11, a drop of 48 percent. The company has struggled to adapt to sharply lower panel prices. Newmont Mining has dropped from $37.79 to $24.60, hurt by falling gold and copper prices. Exelon, the nation's largest supplier of wholesale electric power, has dropped from $43.84 to $29.82 as electricity prices have fallen.
THE ECONOMY
When the stock market hit rock bottom, the economy was struggling, too. Jobs were harder to find five years ago and the U.S. had yet to emerge from the Great Recession. Economic growth has since strengthened, but the recovery remains slow.
When the bull market began in March 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.7 percent. It rose to 10 percent in October that year, its highest level in 26 years. It has since fallen, and was 6.7 percent in February.
COMPANY PROFITS
S&P 500 companies earned an average of $60.81 per share in 2009. Those earnings are projected to almost double to $118.16 by the end of this year, according to S&P Capital IQ data. Corporate profits have climbed as companies have cut costs and demand has revived.
NEW FACES
Twitter shares now trade in the stock market, following its initial public offering in November. Facebook had a $16 billion IPO in May of 2012 and became a member of the S&P 500 in December. Outside of social media, luxury clothing and accessories maker Michael Kors has been one of the more successful market debutants. Its IPO was in December 2011 and it joined the S&P 500 in November.
RETURN OF THE RICH
Like the stock market, billionaires have also staged a comeback.
In 2009, the number of billionaires in the world shrank by 30 percent to 793, with an aggregate wealth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes. The latest list of billionaires published last week shows that their ranks have more than doubled to 1,645, with a combined wealth of $6.4 trillion. The rebounding stock market has helped boost those numbers.
Bill Gates is back on top this year as the world's richest person. The Microsoft founder and philanthropist reclaimed the spot from Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim Helu, who topped the list for the previous four years. Gates' net worth is estimated at $76 billion, compared with $40 billion in 2009.
CAR COMEBACK
The American auto industry has roared back. Crushed by unsustainable debt and sliding sales, General Motors filed for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and got government funding to help it recover. Since then, it has ditched its Pontiac, Saturn, Hummer and Saab lines. The automaker returned to the stock market in November 2010. Its stock closed at $37.69 on Friday, and is up 35 percent in the past year. Chrysler also filed for bankruptcy and has been acquired by Italian automaker Fiat. The only big U.S. automaker to avoid bankruptcy was Ford. Its stock has surged from $1.74 in March 2009 to $15.62 as of Thursday -- gain of 800 percent.

What Comes Next as the Bull Market Turns Five?
This bull, the second strongest since WWII, still looks strong
Mar 10, 2014, 9:30 am EDT   |  By Editor , Zacks Investment Research
   
The current bull market turned five this weekend.  On Mar 9, 2009, the S&P 500 index touched a low of 676.13; it s up 177% since then.
The average length of bull markets since 1921 is 62 months, while average gains are 180%. On the other hand, median gain and length are just 115% and 50 months respectively.
Last bull market ended days after it turned five in October 2007. But according to Capital IQ, bull markets have added another 26% gain if they survived for another year after their fifth anniversary.
Most investors expect the market to go up this year and the path of least resistance for US equities is still up, even though this bull market has been the second strongest since World War II (chart from WSJ).
But can this ageing bull maintain its momentum? Are you turning cautious now?

(Read more: Bull market may still have some sizzle )
The FTSEurofirst300 , an index which ranks the 300 largest companies in Europe by market capitalization, has almost doubled over the same period, closing at 1326.7 at the end of last week. This happened despite the euro zone debt crisis and the bailout of weaker euro zone states like Greece and Ireland threatening the region's stability.
Greek equities are one of only two major asset classes (the other is the U.S. dollar) to fall over the period, and are down 30 percent   but this followed a huge credit crisis which some worried would force the country to leave the euro.
The bull market shows how faith in the will of the European Central Bank and European governments to keep the euro afloat has been restored. Confidence in European equities has returned.
The recent unrest in Ukraine, which some feared could be the kind of black swan event that derails markets, caused a minor dip in European stock markets which has since recovered.
A prolonged military conflict or sanctions may disrupt the region's gas supply from Russia.

Persistent slow growth in the region's biggest economies is potentially more damaging.
"Earnings and economic growth have been (and we believe will continue to be) lackluster, and without growth or central bank liquidity, we see no generic reason to be bullish of European equities," Stewart Richardson, chief investment officer at RMG Wealth Management, warned.
(Read more: Why bull market is like sex: Warren Buffett )
There is a risk of excess liquidity causing "excess valuations in a narrow range of assets"   or asset bubbles like the dotcom bubble of the early years of the twenty-first century, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. So, roughly, if the flight out of emerging markets continues, then the price of assets like London real estate or peripheral euro zone bonds could reach unrealistic heights.
"There are eerie similarities with the 1998-99 period," the BoAML strategists warned.
There are also concerns over European equities' exposure to emerging markets, which account for around 25 percent of European corporate revenues according to UBS research. Panic over the emerging markets has distilled slightly since last year's major sell-off, but is still in the backdrop of market movements.

Picture of the Day
Happy birthday, bull market.
If that sounds less than super-enthusiastic (what, no exclamation mark?), so be it. Yes, the S&P 500 index hit another record on Friday. But two facts make it hard to uncork the champagne and cut myself a slice of cake. The first is that a very large proportion of Americans haven t benefited from this five-year-long rally. The second? I m not confident that this bull market is going to last much longer than many of its predecessors. I certainly doubt whether we re in the early stages of another 18-year bull market like that we witnessed from 1982 until 2000.
I d be more likely to celebrate this bull market if it had enriched a larger swath of the country. Data from Lipper and other providers who monitor flows into mutual funds show that until last year, ordinary investors stayed away in droves; they were more likely to keep yanking money out of stock mutual funds. So while the S&P 500 index is up 177.6 percent since the March 9, 2009 bottom (and 208.9 percent if you take dividends into consideration), anyone who delayed investing until last January lost out on most of those gains. Stocks have continued to soar since then   the S&P 500 is up 28.4 percent, and 31.7 percent if you include dividends   but that s a fraction of what investors could have earned had they been willing and/or able to jump back in the market in 2009.
Related: Confident Market Remains Watchful for Ukraine Disruption
Of course, ordinary investors had plenty of reasons to stay away. In the wake of the financial crisis, many Americans simply may not have felt financially solvent enough to take more risks with their money. Collectively, they had seen trillions wiped off their net worth as a result of the 40 percent stock market nosedive and the meltdown in real estate values.
At the same time, it s not easy to follow Warren Buffett s advice and be greedy when others are fearful, especially when the pain of market losses is so fresh. Consumer confidence   a proxy of sorts for the willingness of investors to take risks   has recovered from the lows seen during the crisis and up until 2009, but it still languishes below its average during non-recessionary periods.
Whatever the reason for the average investor s reluctance to load up on stocks, it s clear they haven t benefitted as much from the market s run. Yes, the net worth of U.S. households hit a new record of $80.6 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2013, according to the Federal Reserve   about $12 trillion above where it stood in the spring of 2007, before the financial crisis. Yet the income gap has only widened in recent years: By the time the economic recovery (as distinct from the stock market recovery, which preceded it) finally got going, the top 1 percent of earners collected 93 percent of income gains .
Let s put to one side the vexing question of whether that s fair or moral or sustainable. This data suggests that the vast majority of American households likely were less able to take advantage of the stock market s recovery, even if they had been able to shake off the lingering psychological effects of the events of 2007 to 2009. Corporate profits may have rebounded, justifying the increase in price/earnings multiples and market valuations that we have witnessed   most dramatically during the course of 2013   but personal earnings and profits didn t .
By the time individual investors shook off their aversion to stocks and climbed back on the bandwagon , it was already 2013. The lion s share of the gains had already been captured. Of course, to the extent that those investors already had a toehold in the market in the form of 401(k) investments in mutual funds that owned stocks, they benefited to some extent, but odds are that their risk aversion was mirrored in their choice of 401(k) allocation as well.  
The question now is whether the bull market will keep going so that those who arrived late to the party have a chance to capture some more gains going forward. It s certainly possible, but market fundamentals are less rosy than they have been. The S&P 500 looks relatively pricey, and analysts are calling for relatively unimpressive first-quarter earnings growth . And economic growth is still clouded in uncertainty.
The Federal Reserve is another source of uncertainty. How committed is the Fed to easing up on its bond market purchases and allowing interest rates to drift higher once more? It s hard to argue that the incredible inflation in the size of the Fed s balance sheet that accompanied the stock market rally is merely a coincidence; what remains unclear is the degree of willingness on the part of investors to focus on equity market fundamentals when the Fed removes its heavy hand from one side of the scales.   
That doesn t mean that we re about to careen off the edge of a cliff   clearly, the bull market requires more than just a slow-motion taper on the part of Fed policymakers and pockets of bad news from emerging markets before it bids us sayonara.
It s worth remembering, however, that if you do feel like celebrating the bull market s birthday, the safest way to do it may be by ordering up a big dessert after dinner rather than by allocating a lot more of your assets to U.S. stocks. Analysts widely expect that, even if the rally does continue, the path forward may be much bumpier than it has been. Certainly, it will be tough for the broad market to replicate its outstanding gains from last year.
If you haven t already rebalanced your portfolio in the wake of the 2013 gains, this is probably a great time to do so   and to scour the market for asset classes that are just as much in the doldrums today as U.S. stocks overall were back in the gloomy days of March 2009.

The 10 Best Stocks of the Bull Market
1. Pharmacyclics
Five-year total return: 19,213% (189% annualized)
52-week price range:$71.85-$154.89
Price-earnings ratio: Not meaningful
Market capitalization: $10.4 billion
Biotechnology has been one of the hottest sectors for the past two years, and no stock shows that better than Pharmacyclics ( PCYC ), which takes the crown as the biggest winner of the five-year-old bull market. A $1,000 investment in the Sunnyvale, Cal., company's shares at the market s bottom in March 2009 is worth a stunning $177,557 today.
The buzz began to build in 2011 for Pharmacyclics's drug Imbruvica, a new treatment for blood cancers such as leukemia. The company that year signed a deal with Johnson & Johnson to develop and market the drug. Last November, the two firms got Food and Drug Administration approval to start selling Imbruvica for a rare blood cancer. In February, the FDA approved the drug for a more common leukemia. Sales have already surged, and analysts on average expect Pharmacyclics's revenues to jump from $260 million in 2013 to $405 million this year and $778 million in 2015. They expect earnings at 8 cents a share this year, then see profits surging to 65 cents a share in 2015.
The real excitement is about broader future uses for Imbruvica in cancer treatment. That's what is driving analysts' extremely bullish outlook for the 23-year-old firm. Robyn Karnauskas, of Deutsche Bank Securities, sees revenues of $4 billion and earnings of $15.66 a share by 2018 and sees the stock at $180 in 12 months. But as the past year has shown, a major challenge for long-term believers in Pharmacyclics is dealing with wild short-term trading in the stock.
Bottom line: Likely to stay a hot stock, but suitable for big risk takers only. How patient can you be?

The Bull at 5: Where Do Stocks Go From Here?
Don't expect anything near the same gains over the next five years.
Alex DUMORTIER, CFA
( TMFAleph1 )
Mar 9, 2014 at 3:30PM
Happy 5th birthday, Mr. Bull Market -- it seems like only yesterday that you sprang from the loins of a dying Bear. Yet, on March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 ( SNPINDEX:^GSPC ) put in its crisis low of 676.53. Investors had given up on stocks in an environment in which they were being bombarded with seemingly catastrophic headlines on a daily basis.
Seven days earlier, troubled insurer AIG had reported a $61.7 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2008 -- the largest loss in U.S. corporate history. Two days after that, General Motors disclosed to its shareholders in its annual report that "there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern" (the company was ultimately restructured under bankruptcy protection.) On March 9, the CBOE Volatility Index ( VOLATILITYINDICES:^VIX ), or VIX, which is sometimes referred to as Wall Street's "fear index," closed at 49.68 -- it has not closed above that since then.
What did we know then?
Instead of imminent doom, however, investors might have anticipated that, barring outright economic collapse, there was a decent chance that stocks would perform reasonably well over the next five years (though the market's actual performance has exceeded what one could have hoped for).
Why?
Valuations. On March 9, the S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE, stood at just 11.9 -- cheaper than it had been at any point since 1986 (the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric popularized by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller, compares stock prices to an average of inflation-adjusted earnings per share over a trailing-10-year period).
And so it was that the fear and revulsion that brought low risky assets in general, and equities in particular, set the foundations for a stunning bull market:
^GSPC data by YCharts
For the S&P 500 (blue line), which now boasts a 178% price return, a triple is almost in sight, if not immediately within reach. Note that the broad market, as represented by the Wilshire 5000 index (orange line) has done even better, thanks to the huge outperformance of small-capitalization stocks; the Russell 2000 (red line) has well more than tripled over the past five years. (Although the S&P 500 is the most widely used measure of the market's performance, it's technically a large-capitalization index.)
Where do we go now?
But where do those gains leave valuations today and what does that augur for returns over the next five years?
As of Friday's close, the S&P 500 now sports a corpulent CAPE of 25.6, going from a 27% discount to its long-term historical average five years ago, to its current 55% premium. That puts the CAPE into the highest 10% of its values over its entire history going back to 1881.
As hedge fund manager Cliff Asness observed in a November 2012 paper , historically, when the CAPE is within the top decile of its values, subsequent stock market returns are mediocre, with a 10-year real return that has averaged just 0.5% on an annualized basis (it's important to note, however, that the range of returns is very wide, varying from (6.3%) to +6.1%).
Last month, another well-regarded value investor, James Montier of GMO, published a white paper describing two methods to forecast real returns over the next seven years based on the CAPE. The more optimistic estimate called for an annualized return of just +0.8%, while the more pessimistic produced a (3.2%) loss! Those ought to be sobering figures, particularly for individual investors who have only now begun to drink directly from the equity market punchbowl.
With the prospect of such mediocre returns, should investors be selling their stocks instead of buying? My answer is "no." As my Foolish colleague Morgan Housel has highlighted, the CAPE isn't perfect (though I would argue it's the best metric we have) and even with a high starting CAPE value, the range of outcomes in terms of performance is very wide. As Cliff Asness points out:
I would, if trading on a tactical outlook, give the Shiller P/E some small weight, particularly when it's above 30 or below 10. But I think this type of analysis is most useful not for a trading strategy but to set reasonable expectations.
If you are a "know-nothing" investor (there is no shame in this -- it's the path almost every investor should adopt), the lesson is to temper one's expectations for future stock market returns -- the next five years are unlikely to mirror the past five and they could end up being very disappointing relative to stocks' historical average return (roughly 6.5% per annum, after inflation). Still, if you have an equity-appropriate time horizon, you can continue to put money into a low-cost index fund at regular intervals.
2 values in a heated market
If you have some skill, experience, and time -- and the inclination to pick individual stocks -- know that it's becoming increasingly difficult to ferret out names that trade at a discount to (or even at) their intrinsic value. However, there are still some values out there. Take the insurance sector, for example: MetLife ( NYSE:MET ), the No. 1 publicly traded life insurer in the U.S., is a wonderful franchise, yet it is valued at less than 9.5 times the next 12 months' earnings-per-share estimate -- a significant discount to the overall market. Viewed from another angle, it does not take much in the way of returns on equity to justify the stock's 21% premium to its tangible book value.
Another insurance-related name, Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE:BRK-B ), looks reasonably priced. In his recently released annual letter to shareholders, CEO Warren Buffett wrote that stock repurchases at 120% of book value "benefit continuing shareholders because per-share intrinsic value exceeds that percentage of book value by a meaningful amount." On Friday, Berkshire's shares closed at 136% of book value. My sense is that when Buffett refers to a "meaningful amount," it's more than the difference by which 136 exceeds 120.
When it comes to individual stocks or the broad market, valuation has predictive value with regard to future performance. Right now, the U.S. stock market doesn't look particularly cheap, and while that tells us nothing about the market's direction in the near term, it's an anchor on performance over the medium to long term. Just as investors who extrapolated bear market losses into the future five years ago were wrong, those who extrapolate similar gains to those achieved over the past five years could well be making the same mistake today.

Sweet, well behaved one day, an unruly hellion the next? It's about what you'd expect from a 5-year-old.
And so it has been recently with the stock market, which marks the fifth anniversary on March 9 of its bear-market lows, when the Standard & Poor's 500 index touched 666, the mark of the Devil from the Book of Revelation, following a near-biblical set of plagues loosed on the financial system and the world economy in 2007-08....

Huge 5-year fund returns? Don t be misled
Many funds have more than doubled in the last five years, but that s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market.
Start the conversation >
Fabulous can have a flip side.
It s something investors should remember as mutual funds  five-year return figures grow more eye-popping by the day. Many funds have more than doubled over that time, but that s due in part to the calendar creeping closer to the five-year anniversary of the March 9, 2009, bottom for the market.
That means the darkest days of the financial crisis are no longer counted in five-year returns, leaving only the recovery that sent the Standard & Poor s 500 index to a record high.
The anniversary is a key milestone because many potential investors scrutinize a fund s five-year record when deciding whether to buy a fund. It s important, though, to put those stellar performance numbers in context and to temper expectations.
Market conditions are stacked against both stock and bond mutual funds having such strong returns over the next five years, analysts say. Plus, some of the funds with the best five-year returns led the pack because they focused on the riskiest investments. Many conservative managers, meanwhile, got left behind in the bull market.
To see how big the numbers are, check the performance of the largest mutual fund by assets. Vanguard s Total Stock Market Index fund (VTSMX) has a five-year annualized return of 23.2 percent, according to Morningstar. At the end of 2012, its five-year annualized return was only 2.2 percent.
Investors already have some experience with this effect. Something similar happened with funds  three-year returns in early 2012.
A fund s three- and five-year returns are typically the numbers that average investors find most important, says David Mertens, a principal at Jensen Investment Management. Its mutual funds include Jensen Quality Growth (JENSX), which has Morningstar s gold-medal analyst rating.
Mertens would prefer that investors give greater weight to a fund s returns over 10 years or even longer. But  people tend to buy what s just happened,  he says.  People buy yesterday s story. 
Before you invest, here are some key considerations to put that story in perspective:
  A repeat performance is doubtful
Stocks are unlikely to rise as dramatically, in part because they don t look as cheap as they did in 2009. One popular way to measure whether a stock is expensive is to divide the price of a stock by its earnings per share over the last 12 months.
Robert Shiller, a professor at Yale University and one of the winners of the Nobel Prize in economics last year, takes it a step further. He thinks it s misleading to look at just one year because earnings can surge or drop in an economic cycle. To smooth out distortions, he looks at the S&P 500 s level versus its average earnings per share over the prior 10 years, adjusting for inflation.
By that measure, the S&P 500 in March 2009 was at its cheapest level in 23 years. Now, it s nearly twice that level and back above its average since World War II. That suggests future gains for stocks won t come from a further rise in price-earnings ratios as much as from growth in earnings.
This year, analysts forecast earnings per share for S&P 500 companies to rise 7.9 percent.
For bond funds, strategists are more pessimistic given expectations that interest rates will rise from their relatively low levels. Five years ago, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 3 percent and on its way down. Falling interest rates help bond mutual funds because they push up prices for existing bonds.
Now, the 10-year Treasury s yield is below 2.7 percent, but strategists say it s on its way up. Many bond mutual funds in 2013 had their first down year in more than a decade amid rising interest rates.
  The last five years have rewarded risk
The top-performing stock fund over the last five years has been the Direxion Monthly NASDAQ-100 Bull 2x fund (DXQLX), which has a 60.7 percent annualized return. But it s not what most people would consider a core investment. The fund is meant more for short-term traders than long-term investors.
It uses leverage in its attempt to double the monthly results of the Nasdaq 100 index, before fees and expenses. While that supercharges gains when the market is strong, it also accelerates losses during downturns. The fund lost 82.8 percent in 2008.
The reward for risk taking can also be seen among target-date mutual funds, which many savers depend on for their retirement accounts. These funds own mostly stocks when an investor s retirement date is far off and automatically migrate toward bonds as the date nears. But some have less in stocks than others, even if they re targeted at the same year of retirement.
The Wells Fargo Advantage Dow Jones Target 2025 fund, for example, is more conservative. That s why it s in the bottom 3 percent of its peer group for five-year returns. But in 2008, its greater emphasis on bonds helped to cushion the stock market s losses, and it was in the category s top 7 percent.
The good news is that investors don t have to look back too far to see how a fund manager performed in a variety of markets, says David Lafferty, chief market strategist for Natixis Global Asset Management. It has $867.2 billion in assets under management.
Since the late  90s, stocks have undergone three bull markets (the dot-com boom, the housing bubble and the most recent recovery for stocks) and two bear markets (the dot-com bust and the financial crisis).

Odds are against the stock market's aging bull making it through a sixth year, but this is no ordinary bull market.
Analysts expect stocks to continue running higher but at a slower pace than the 30 percent gain of last year.
It was five years ago this week that the S&P 500 plunged to an intraday low of 666, forcing capitulation of even the steadiest hands in a market panicking on fears that the financial sector was so ill it couldn't be cured.

Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
Blue chips, like American Express and General Electric , were trading in the single digits. Since then, the S&P 500 has rebounded 177 percent to new highs, and the wounded financial sector is up more than 250 percent but still 60 percent off its 2007 high, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Fewer than a third of bull markets make it through a sixth year, but those that do have averaged gains of 26 percent in that year, says S&P Capital IQ. Monday marks the start of year six, and Wall Street strategists nearly all expecting solid gains this year say the economy will now have to prove that it is strong enough to keep corporate profits rising, as the Fed continues to pull back from its easy money policies.
"I think in a sense we're back to a more normal market environment,"  said Sam Stovall, chief strategist of S&P Capital IQ. Stovall, like others, says the market is particularly stretched since it has not had a major correction in months. "I think we're bumping up against fair value for stocks, so unless we make some dramatic change to our economic and earnings growth expectations then I think we either have to correct in time or in price." But he still targets the S&P reaching 1,940 by year-end.
(Read more: All clear on jobs front? Hmmm, maybe not so much )
While many analysts drew parallels during the financial crisis to the Great Depression and the market crash that preceded it, Stovall said the policy reactions were very different this time. "What was different was the way the Fed responded to the financial crisis. What made me think this is not the 1930s/1940s is we got back to break even after five years. It took 25 years to get back to break even after the crash of 1929, and I think the bulk of that delay was the missteps of both the Fed and the Treasury."
With the Fed stepping back  from its bond-buying program, stocks will have to navigate an environment of rising rates as long as economic growth improves as expected. Rates moved higher after Friday's jobs report reinforced the view that a recent batch of weak data is likely temporary and the result of bad winter weather. The 10-year yield was as high as 2.81 percent, a six-week high. There were 175,000 nonfarm payrolls added in February, the best pace since last year.

"We are paying most attention to the growth numbers. Typically over the last several years, the monetary policy picture has been a huge driver, and getting that right was a big part of being correct about making money in the market," said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust. "We think that's fading to the back burner. The market's got QE fatigue. What the market really needs to see to continue the bull market is organic growth because the Fed said: 'we want to get out of this game.' "
The market will also have to deal with more volatility, already impacting stocks this year since the Fed began pulling back from its quantitative easing program. Analysts, however, do not expect rates to rise so rapidly stocks will be jarred, and that's partly because the Fed has vowed to hold short-term rates lower for longer.
(Watch: Cashin says: Goldilocks jobs number )
"Our base case is we will see better performance of the market in the second half of the year because we do think better growth will come through. The stock market can handle higher rates as long as the economy is growing but if rates are rising because inflation is the cause, the market doesn't like that," McDonald said. "The increases we have had in rates are because of better growth and a view the Fed is beginning to normalize policy, and we think that's good for the stock market."
Gary Thayer, chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors, said the market should be able to handle the Fed's move away from QE. He expects the S&P to reach 1,975 to 2,025 this year. "I think the economy has been healing, and I think there's a lot of room for growth, and if you look at things like consumer debt ratios, debt service to income is very low the lowest level in 30 years. The last two times we were this low were the early stages of expansion in the early 1980s and early 1990s," he said. Thayer said the debt service to disposable income is down to 9.92 percent from 13.18 before the financial crisis and compared to 10.37 in the early 1990s.
(Read more: Americans borrow more but hit the plastic less )
"The bottom line is we still have the capacity to grow further if there aren't any major disruptions in the global economy. We think even though the market has done well in five years, there's a lot of room for further gains. It may not be smooth sailing every year, but we see more gains."
Thayer said he sees that the biggest risks for U.S. stocks are likely to come from overseas, and he would put money first into U.S. stocks, then Japan and Europe, and lastly emerging markets.
McDonald said the situation with Ukraine should not impact stocks even if Crimea becomes part of Russia, but further aggression could change that view.
"What would cause the bull market to end? There's two possibilities. One is the economy runs out of gas and investors say: 'There's no more monetary support. We're going to take money off the table,' " he said. "The second is the economy gets so strong that the Fed has to raise interest rates and you have a typical end of the bull market." But McDonald said he is still constructive on stocks though he said the idea that the economy gets weaker is the scenario he sees as more likely at some point in the next couple of years.
"We have gone over 600 days without a 10 percent correction. Typically on average, you have a 10 percent correction every 161 days. 1,250 days without a 20 percent correction. We typically have one every 635 days. The market is extended," said McDonald. "Those periods tend to be more extended during bull cycles. It is not unusual to have longer cycles when the market is going up, and that 's what we experienced, but it's telling you this rally is long in the tooth."

The S&P 500 closed up just about 1 percent this past week, at 1,878. Events in Ukraine first sent stocks spiraling lower Monday before swinging to record highs later in the week. The Dow was up 0.8 percent for the week, at 16,452, and the Nasdaq was up 0.6 percent at 4,336. The Dow is still more than 100 points away from its all-time high.
In the coming week, traders said Treasurys could continue to trade lower, with yields rising, ahead of $64 billion in auctions for three- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds Tuesday through Thursday.
Key data in the week ahead includes retail sales on Thursday.
Perhaps one of the biggest events of the week will be the confirmation hearing for Stanley Fischer as Fed vice chair. The hearing also includes the renomination of Jerome Powell as Fed governor, and the nomination of Lael Brainard as a member of the board.

S&P 500 rebound from March 2009 lows joins small club of five-year-plus surges
By
WallaceWitkowski
Reporter
SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch)   U.S. stocks enter their sixth year of a bull market this Monday, joining a rare group of multi-year stock surges that can support early retirements, pay off college debt, and make pension funds whole.
Or not. The fifth year of the last bull market ended spectacularly and painfully for investors in October 2007, leaving many so scarred they avoided stocks years into this latest rebound.
The good news: The few cycles that make it past their fifth birthday keep motoring along, churning out as much as a decade of gains. Momentum is your friend: On average, the sixth year has produced 26% growth.
The bad: There's plenty that s different this time around, starting with the Federal Reserve s full-throttle bond buys to flatten yields. The S&P 500 already produced an eye-popping 30% gain last year. The economy needs to get back its mojo   the 3% growth rate that s been elusive since 2005.
 What ended nearly every [bull market] was a recession, so we need continued economic growth,  said Jeff Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
The almost five-year-old bull market started on March 10, 2009, when the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.26%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.20%  both rebounded 6% in one day off their respective multi-year lows reached March 9 . At the low, the S&P 500 closed at a bottom of 676.53, a drop of nearly 57% from its October 2007 highs. The Dow closed at 6,547.05. Since then, the S&P 500 has climbed 177% and the Dow has gained 151%.
Group of three
Concern that days are numbered for the current bull market are not unfounded. A minority of bull markets since 1945 have made it to their sixth birthday.
P/E ratios are back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007.
Including the current bull market, there have been 12 since the end of World War II. Of those, only half of them made it to a fifth birthday, according to Sam Stovall, chief equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ, in a recent note.
After that, the list gets halved again for those making it to a sixth birthday. Those bull markets include the 7-year bull market that ended in August 1956, the 6-year bull market that ended in November 1980, and the nearly 10-year-old bull market that ended in March 2000. Those go-go days of the 1990s bull market, which ended in the Internet bust, fattened nest eggs with an S&P 500 gain of over 400%.
The history is tantalizing, particularly for investors still repairing the damage from the last bear market and a concurrent housing market collapse.
Here s what this bull market needs to do to make it to its sixth birthday, says Stovall:
U.S. economic growth needs to ramp up and reach 3% by the end of 2014 supported by gains in auto sales and housing.
Earnings per share growth needs to increase in the mid-to-high single digits in 2014 coupled with gains in revenue. Stovall expects an 8% advance in EPS with revenue rising 3.7%.
Congress needs to indicate that it is working toward meaningful tax reform legislation by 2015 to help spur increased capital expenditures and repatriation of foreign earnings.
Valuations based on price-to-earnings ratios remain supportive.
That last part can be troubling given concerns that stock prices have grown faster than their supporting earnings. Stovall said that while the trailing 12-month P/E is above average since 1947, it s actually below the average when the consumer price index has been in the 1.5% to 2.5% range.
For the economy, a 3% growth rate for the U.S. isn t a slam dunk. The U.S. economy hasn t grown 3% or more in nine years. A recent revision of fourth-quarter GDP figures showed the economy growing at 2.4% , down from a previous figure of 3.2%.
Read: Is the White House s 3.1% growth forecast still too rosy?
In this aging bull s favor, it s still cheap to borrow to buy and build. The yield on the 10-year Treasury US:10_YEAR  note is in the 2.7% range   in contrast to 4.65% at the end of the last bull market in October 2007.
Stocks are  shackled to earnings growth 
Back in March 2009, P/E ratios for stocks in the S&P 500 had fallen below 11x . Now, they re back over 17x, where they were at the end of the last bull market in 2007. That means that earnings growth has become even more crucial to cool off those multiples.

Law360, New York (March 10, 2014,  1:50 PM EDT) -- Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox sought Chapter 15 protection in Texas on Sunday, saying it needed to halt two pending lawsuits in the U.S. while it sorts out its financial affairs through its main bankruptcy proceeding in Tokyo.
Mt. Gox CEO Robert Marie Mark Karpeles said in court papers that the exchange is seeking Chapter 15 recognition of its main proceeding in Japan so that it can focus on maximizing recoveries to its creditors. Karpeles is also asking that the Texas bankruptcy court where the petition...

(Photo : Reuters/Jim Urquhart) Every MIT undergrad will receive $100 of the digital currency this semester.
Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of Mt. Gox, one of the world's most popular bitcoin exchanges, which is now bankrupt.
The company initially announced that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins, 750,000 of which belonged to investors and users. It is estimated that the number balances out to $480 million.
The attackers are claiming that, along with the 750,000 customer bitcoins, 100,000 of the company's own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits are missing, PC World reported .
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy last month after the exchange mysteriously went offline, stopping cryptocurrency trades, according to PC Magazine .
"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin community's wrath instead of the bitcoin community getting Goxed," the unnamed group wrote, referring to Mt. Gox's downtime and other glitches.
According to PC Magazine , the hackers posted a 716MB file of stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers to the French CEO's website, including a spreadsheet of over a million trades, 18 currencies of the company's balance (in addition to bitcoin), access to Tibanne Limited (Gox's parent company), and a screenshot of the hackers' access. Karpeles's home address and personal resume were also listed.
"This release would have been sooner, but in the spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the date," the hackers wrote, telling readers to "repost and share this info before it's gond."
The initial post on Reddit was deleted, and Kerpeles's website is currently down.
Mt. Gox has blamed a security issue called transaction malleability, which lets hackers manipulate transaction identification numbers, so they can steal bitcoins, PC World reports .

Mt. Gox is well-known for creating one of the world's first Bitcoin trading posts. Unfortunately, in the company's most recent attempt to save its legacy, the virtual company has had to file for bankruptcy to protect its remaining assets, while trying to expand internationally.
Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States. Chapter 15 bankruptcy is special because it often deals with cases and scenarios that are related to other countries as well. The goal of this proceeding is to combine efforts to come to a mutual agreement.
The Japanese company first filed for bankruptcy protection on February 28, back in Tokyo, Japan. Filing in the U.S. enables the virtual currency company to use the U.S. court systems which would help solve the company's case faster and much more efficiently.
Related: What Companies Accept Bitcoin?
CEO Mark Karpeles is blaming cyber attacks and theft for the loss of monetary gain and has even stated that it can go bankrupt at any point in time. "For several weeks MtGox customers have been affected by bitcoin withdrawal issues that compounded on themselves. Publicly, MtGox declared that 'transaction malleability' caused the system to be subject to theft, and that something needed to be done by the core devs to fix it."
Karpeles continued, "Gox's own workaround solution was criticized, and eventually a fix was provided by Blockchain.info. The truth, it turns out, is that the damage had already been done. At this point 744,408 BTC are missing due to malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years.
"The cold storage has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet. The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company."
Even though all signs point to a bankrupt company, the Bitcoin industry has flourished in general and some signs have even pointed to new ATMs being created to function with Bitcoin currency.

Getting Goxed: Mt. Gox s U.S. bankruptcy and hacker attack

Furious about your Mt. Gox losses? You ll have to cool your heels.
U.S. legal actions against Mt. Gox   notably a lawsuit filed in Chicago federal court that sought class-action status   are on temporary hold after the bitcoin exchange submitted a bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday.
Mt. Gox sought Chapter 15 protection, designed for cases where the parties are based in multiple countries. The Tokyo company, once the world s largest bitcoin trading post, filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on Feb. 28 .
At the time it said  750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 Mt. Gox bitcoins were missing, meaning a cool $450 million had gone up in smoke.
The U.S. bankruptcy eventually could benefit stranded investors, giving the U.S. a structure to work with other countries to track down any remaining assets.
Over the weekend, furious bitcoin users hacked the website of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles , posting data that appears to show that the exchange still holds customer investments in the millions of dollars.
 It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities  wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,  an anonymous hacker wrote.
So on the downside, Mt. Gox has imploded. On the upside, it s vaulted into the echelons of companies whose names became common verbs. Of course, being synonymous with total flakiness is not something most CEOs aspire to.
Believe it or not, getting  goxed  first showed up in Urban Dictionary almost three years ago after a spate of Mt. Gox closures and trading delays, but it s caught fire in the past couple of weeks.

Hackers this weekend targeted the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of the bankrupt Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, posting information online that they claim proves Karpeles is actually hoarding bitcoins he claims were stolen.
The hackers charge that some of the nearly half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency lost in recent cyberattacks is actually still in the French CEO's possession.
"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," the unnamed group wrote, according to Forbes , a reference to the downtime and other glitches that have plagued Mt. Gox.
The hackers initially posted to Karpeles's website a 716MB file of stolen data from Mt.

An abridged version, which features Mt. Gox's balances, was later posted online , with a link to the entire set of data.

Karpeles's website is currently offline , and the original Reddit post has since been deleted.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan late last month, saying it lost 750,000 bitcoins, or about $480 million 7 percent of the estimated global total of bitcoins. An attack on the company's computer systems also cost Gox about 100,000 of its own units.
The filing came days after the exchange mysteriously went offline, halting trades of the cryptocurrency.
Last month, meanwhile, bitcoins valued at approximately $2.7 million went missing from Silk Road 2, allegedly due to a hack. Silk Road 2 is the reincarnation of the original Silk Road, an online black market for all things criminal that was shut down by the feds last year. The new site emerged in November and is only accessible to those who have an invite and sign in using the Tor anonymizing service.
Bitcoin has been a popular topic of late. Last week, Newsweek said it had uncovered the creator of bitcoin , a 64-year-old California man named Satoshi Nakamoto. But has denied any involvement .

UPDATE 2-Mt. Gox files U.S. bankruptcy, opponents call it a ruse
FULL COVERAGE:
* Objectors allege Mt. Gox's U.S. bankruptcy part of a fraud
* Opponents said Karpeles recently moved millions of dollars of bitcoins
* Case may revive criticisms of U.S. shell corporations
By Tom Hals
March 10 Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.
Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets. Mt. Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.
The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.
"This case involves a massive fraud," said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. "They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse."
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.
"We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles," said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.
Mt. Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.
Hale's order protects Mt. Gox's U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.
Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.
Mt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies' owners.
The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company's true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies' activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.
Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means "worthless little symbol" in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.
It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.
Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.
When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.
He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.
Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.
The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.
The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver's license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.
The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

Mt. Gox Chief Stole 100,000 Bitcoins, Hackers Claim
Cryptocurrency aficionados' ire stoked by leaked accounts showing 100,000 bitcoins remain missing.
Hackers seized control of the personal blog of Mark Karpeles, CEO of the bankrupt Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange, on Sunday and posted a message accusing him of stealing 100,000 bitcoins (BTC).
"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," read the message, which hackers posted both to Karpeles's magicaltux.net site as well as to his Reddit page. "This release would have been sooner, but in [the] spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of [our] ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than [we] would have liked to verify the data."
The data in question referred to a dump -- a.k.a. dox -- in the form of a 716-MB zip file, which hackers distributed via Karpeles's site, and which purportedly contained evidence of fraud. "Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, CSV exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with [expletive] Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included." The zip file also includes an Excel spreadsheet listing about a million Mt. Gox trades , a screenshot of hackers' access to the systems of Mt. Gox's parent company, Tibanne Limited, a listing of Mark Karpeles's home addresses, as well as his CV, Forbes reported.
[Mt. Gox is not the only Bitcoin exchange with problems. See Bitcoin Heists Cause More Trouble .]
Also included -- and excerpted in a post to Pastebin -- were the exchange's alleged balances, in 18 different currencies, including a bitcoin balance of 951,116 BTC. Whoever hacked Karpeles's site cited that number as evidence that the Mt. Gox chief lied about the site going bankrupt, since he'd said that attackers appeared to have stolen 850,000 bitcoins . In other words, there appeared to be a discrepancy involving 100,000 BTC, which would have been worth about $62.4 million.
Some Bitcoin followers read that discrepancy as evidence that Karpeles still controlled a horde of bitcoins, no matter whether hackers had stolen the rest. Or in the words of one Reddit commenter: "We've been goxed!"
But other Bitcoin watchers said that the leaked data, while likely legitimate, didn't prove anything about the actual state of either Mt. Gox's coffers -- to say nothing of its accounting prowess. "It's legit data, but it's not proof of anything ," said "PuffyHerb" on Reddit. "This is Mt. Gox's internal accounting. If there are problems with this, then it lines up with what they've been [saying] all along (i.e. they didn't know BTC was being siphoned off)."
While Karpeles appears to have blanked out his personal site after hackers began using it to distribute their dox, supposed copies of the data dump have been mirrored to other download sites and are also circulating via BitTorrent.
One caution for anyone who wants to analyze the leaked information: In a discussion on Bitcoin Forum, multiple people said that the text files in the download "are interesting and safe," but warned that executable files in the zip archive contain malware , and thus should only be analyzed using a virtual machine (VM). "One of the .exe files contains the wallet.dat stealer," said "oyvinds" in a comment. "Only run the .exe files in a throw-away VM if you are curious or on your normal Windows installation if you have too many Bitcoins and want to get rid of them." He noted that a PDF document included in the dump also included "evil JavaScript," suggesting that it was designed to steal bitcoins.
As the hackers' accusations suggest, many Bitcoin aficionados are fuming over Mt. Gox's meltdown, and don't mind taking revenge at the expense of other Mt. Gox -- or Bitcoin -- users. On a related note, as Forbes first reported, a Bitcoin Forum user called "nanashi___" on Friday posted a message offering to sell a 20-GB file of user information -- including passport scans -- allegedly stolen from Mt. Gox, for 100 bitcoins (about $62,000) to cover losses he incurred from the exchange's failure. "Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure," according to the post, which has since been deleted by the forum's administrators. "Asking 100BTC for entire document. Willing to sell it in pieces, 10BTC for 2gb of data."
Revenge aside, fresh evidence that Mt. Gox's bitcoins were stolen by outside attackers surfaced Sunday, when The Japan News reported -- referencing multiple, unnamed sources -- that the exchange was being hammered by distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks , peaking at 150,000 system access attempts per second. The attacks, which reportedly originated from systems in the United States and Europe, began on February 7, and apparently occurred at the same time as hackers were draining the company's bitcoin balance via transaction malleability attacks .
On February 10, Mt. Gox suspended all bitcoin withdrawals, before filing for bankruptcy protection on February 28.
While it's not clear whether Mt. Gox's bitcoin thieves also launched the DDoS attacks, criminals have regularly employed DDoS smokescreens to steal bitcoins. In November, for example, the Denmark-based Bitcoin Internet Payment System (BIPS) was hit by a DDoS attack at the same time that attackers hacked into the company's free online wallets and stole 1,295 bitcoins, worth nearly $1 million. According to Kris Henriksen, CEO of the Bitcoin payment processor, the attacks against his site appeared to emanate "from Russia and neighboring countries."

Mt. Gox files for U.S. bankruptcy to halt class action
Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.

Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.
Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.
A hearing in Dallas was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday to consider Mt. Gox's request to stay pending lawsuits against the company.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets.
Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.
Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.
In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.
Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.
Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie.

Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles announces the request for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo last month.Reuters
The Japanese-based bitcoin exchange has filed bankruptcy papers in the US following a similar move in Japan last month.
On Sunday, Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US having filed a similar application in Japan on 28 February. The particular chapter of bankruptcy protection sought deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.
The move is just the latest move in the unfolding story of what was once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, handling up to 80% of all trades at one point in 2013.
On 28 February the exchange's CEO Mark Karpeles filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo claiming that 850,000 bitcoins (at the time worth around  240 million) had been stolen from the exchange, 100,000 which belonged to the company and 750,000 belonging to the customers.
Chapter 15 protection in the US was introduced back in 1997 and is almost entirely based on the UN Model Law which aims to modernise and harmonise cross-border insolvencies around the world.
Some relief
If granted it would provide some relief for Mt. Gox, including the granting of an "automatic stay" preventing creditors seizing its US assets.
A company files for bankruptcy protection if it believes it can recover financially, given time and some amount of restructuring and reorganisation - this could include a change of management, business model or the selling of a highly-value assets such as buildings (which could be leased back from the buyer) or vehicles.
When a company files for bankruptcy outright, it has accepted that it is no longer able to repay its creditors and any steps for recovery are impossible.
The latest move in Mt. Gox's story comes after hackers claim to have stolen transaction logs from the exchange which they published on Karpeles' personal blog over the weekend. The hackers claim the under-fire CEO was lying about the amount of bitcoins the exchange had leading to many users of Mt. Gox to claim Karpeles had stolen their bitcoins.

Anonymous hackers claim MtGox still has 'stolen' Bitcoins
The bad news keeps getting worse for MtGox. Two weeks on from being forced to close after hackers stole approximately 850,000 Bitcoins (BTC), the currency exchange now faces accusations that it is still holding onto some of the 'stolen' Bitcoins.
Bitcoin exchanges hit by malformed code DDoS attacks
Forbes reports that anonymous hackers took over community website Reddit, as well as the personal blog of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles, on Sunday to allege that Karpeles had actually retained some of the Bitcoins that the company said had been stolen from its users.
The blog post has since been removed, although the message can be viewed on Pastebin .
"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data."
The 716MB file dumps appears to include personal data   including Karpeles' home address and resume, as well as a purported screenshot of MtGox's Bitcoin balance.
Hackers say that this ledger shows that the trading exchange still has a current balance of 951,116 BTC which would   if true   mean that customer Bitcoins have not been lost, but rather that fraud has been committed. MtGox filed for Japanese bankruptcy on 28 February and claimed at the time that it had lost around 850,000 Bitcoins , including 100,000 of its own, as well as approximately  16.41 million (US$ 27.3 million) in customer deposits.
Forbes writer Andy Greenberg points out that it is possible that this could simply be a case of accounting mismatches, with the exchange counting Bitcoins as being safe even when they had already been stolen. However, it is worth noting that since MtGox has filed for bankruptcy protection, the public ledger of Bitcoin transactions   the Bitcoin blockchain (which tracks the movement of currency, while ensuring that the users are anonymous)   has not registered any movement of the  stolen  virtual coins.
 I couldn't verify that Sunday's database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how MtGox's accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins that it was counting Bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves,  said Greenberg.
In related news, MtGox recently issued a press release to say that phishing campaigns have been making the rounds. Hackers have used MtGox's identity and been asking for the name, address, username, password and bank account numbers of those who have lost virtual currency.
Karpeles and other MtGox officials couldn't be reached for comment on this story.

Mt. Gox files for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S.
March 10, 2014, 12:39 PM ET
Share:
Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox on Sunday filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy in the U.S., more than a week after it filed for bankruptcy in Japan and disclosed that it had lost about 750,000 of its customers\  bitcoins.
Bloomberg News
Mark Karpeles, chief executive of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.
Chapter 15 is a chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code that facilitates insolvency cases involving parties in more than one country. Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 in Dallas and is being represented by Baker & McKenzie, which is also the law firm representing Mt. Gox its civil rehabilitation proceeding in Japan.
\ There may be Mt. Gox assets and liabilities in the U.S.   clearly there is at least one lawsuit that we re already aware of   and to the extent bitcoins with a relationship to Mt. Gox are accessible in the U.S., Mt. Gox wants to invoke the bankruptcy automatic stay,\  said Ira Herman, a partner at Thompson & Knight in New York.
\ The automatic stay will serve to halt attempts including litigation to recover against Mt. Gox or to seize Mt. Gox\ s assets,\  said Herman, adding that the stay doesn\ t apply until a recognition order is entered.
Mt. Gox\ s Chapter 15 filing showed it is seeking relief from two parties in the U.S. with pending litigation: CoinLab Inc. and Gregory Greene, a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit who alleges he lost $25,000 worth of bitcoin. The  class-action lawsuit  was filed against Mt. Gox and Chief Executive Mark Karpeles on Feb. 28 in Illinois on behalf of all people in the U.S. who held bitcoins in the exchange by the law firm Edelson PC. The lawsuit seeks the return of the customers\  funds and damages against Mt. Gox and Karpeles.
There is an emergency hearing scheduled for Monday in Texas on Mt. Gox\ s filing, according to Christopher Dore, a partner at Edelson who is working on the case. He refused to comment until after the hearing.
Mt. Gox\ s  application for a Japanese civil rehabilitation proceeding on Feb. 28 disclosed that the exchange\ s liabilities exceed its assets, and some of the liabilities may have been linked to missing bitcoins. The Japanese proceeding, which is similar to a Chapter 11 filing in the U.S., noted the possibility of letting Mt. Gox continue business operations \ in order to increase repayments to our creditors.\ 
The bankruptcy filing in Japan came after Mt. Gox abruptly shuttered its website, leaving users unable to trade or access the bitcoins stored in the exchange, and followed days of halts on bitcoin withdrawals.
\ Rebuilding MtGox Co., Ltd under the supervision of the court in a legally organized procedure while giving proper explanations will not be for the sole benefit of the company but for that of the whole bitcoin community,\  the application for civil rehabilitation in Japan said.

Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange files for bankruptcy in the U.S., hackers reveal more inside info
10 March 2014, 12:30 pm EDT By Doug Olenick Tech Times

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for Chapter 15 U.S. bankruptcy protection on March 9, a follow up to a similar filing in Japan in late February.
Chapter 15 protection allows for insolvent international companies to benefit from the U.S. court system. It is not exactly clear yet how this will benefit Mt. Gox. The purpose of Chapter 15, and the Model Law on which it is based, is to provide effective mechanisms for dealing with insolvency cases involving debtors, assets, claimants and other parties of interest involving more than one country.
"Generally, a chapter 15 case is ancillary to a primary proceeding brought in another country, typically the debtor's home country," according to the U.S. Federal Court bankruptcy statute.
Another report has the Mt. Gox system being hacked over the weekend with someone breaking into Mt. Box CEO Mark Karpeles blog. The hackers allegedly pulled a spreadsheet showing that 950,000 Bitcoins were still on the books. Other tidbits include that Mt. Gox had around 1 million customers as of December, although no personal data was released by these tech hounds.
Karpeles has blamed his company's weak security system for the original Bitcoin loss.
This is just the latest in a string of moves surrounding Mt. Gox and the Bitcoin world during the last week.
Bitcoin itself has been the center of controversy since it was created in 2009. Banks and nations have fretted over what it could do to traditional currencies and the bankruptcy of Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox last month is causing further worries over the viability of the currency and the fact that the largest such exchange simply lost or could not find 850,000 Bitcoins priced at the time at around $500 billion.
That is a lot of money, real or digital.
Then, last week the burner was turned on full blast with the revelation by Newsweek that the mysterious man behind Bitcoin was an unassuming, retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto has  denied  he is the brains behind Bitcoin and that until recently he had never even heard about Bitcoin, but Newsweek is sticking by its story.
Since then Nakamoto has had to lead a life more akin to a Hollywood celebrity, with dozens of reporters chasing his every move.
The urge to discover who truly is the founder of the digital currency is understandable. That person could potentially be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, and if a face could be connected with the service it could help make it even more successful or at least save it from an early death.
A famous definition of money is that it's an idea backed by confidence, something that is lacking right now. A currency depends on people believing that it is a safe haven and there is little reason for any confidence to be placed on Bitcoin now with the only names associated with Bitcoin either denying their affiliation or trying to explain why their firm went  bankrupt  or  dying .
The most important failure may well be that the entire Bitcoin universe is nothing but a house of cards waiting to topple.
"Mt. Gox is not alone. Forty-five percent of Bitcoin exchanges to date  have failed , in most cases with their customers' money. The digital currency industry's track record on fiduciary responsibility is abysmal,"  wrote  Ken Griffith.
The other aspect of this that has to be studied is whether or not a currency, digital or otherwise, can be sustainable without being governed and backed by a national entity.
At  Hackingdistributed.com  Bitcoin exchanges were compared to the infamous Nigerian prince Internet scams, but these are actually targeted at tech-savvy people.
"Even if the Bitcoin protocol were perfect,  and it isn't , our computing infrastructure is not up to the task of handling high-value transactions. The exchanges are built on the latest hyped technologies that have incredibly poor guarantees, and routinely run into technical problems," the site wrote.

Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.
Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.
In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.
Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.
Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie.

Just days after it sought protection in Japan , once popular Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been forced to file for bankruptcy in the US in the hope of climbing out of the huge hole it's found itself in. Still reeling from the loss of 850,000 Bitcoins (currently worth around $549 million) and debts of more than $63.6 million, the company has filed papers that will temporarily suspend US legal action against it , allowing it to work out how "weaknesses in the system" allowed the digital currency to go missing in the first place. It's not quite the news customers were hoping for, but it's a logical move by Mt. Gox as it will better protect investors located outside of Japan and could also open avenues for it to take on financial aid. While it continues to piece together exactly what happened, some are taking matters into their own hands. Over the weekend, hackers reportedly gained access to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog as well as his Tumblr and Reddit accounts, accusing the company of fraud and alleging it kept some of the Bitcoins that had been reported stolen.

Hackers accuse Mt. Gox of pocketing users' Bitcoins
Hackers accuse Mt. Gox of pocketing users' Bitcoins

10 Mar, 2014
Mystery surrounding Bitcoin exchange's demise deepens with allegations of financial deception.
Defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been accused of pocketing its users  cash by a group of hackers who infiltrated the personal blog and Reddit account of the service s CEO.
The repository made headlines last month after  200 million worth of Bitcoins were allegedly stolen by hackers, forcing the organisation to file for bankruptcy protection in Japan and close its doors.
The company claimed in the bankruptcy filing that it had lost 750,000 customer Bitcoins, as well as 100,000 company-owned ones too.
However, a separate group of hackers have now accused the firm of pocketing at least some of the money it told users had been stolen.
According to a report by Forbes , the hackers gained access to the Reddit account and personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles to post a missive detailing their accusations.
 It s time that MTGOX got the Bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,  the hackers wrote.
The term  Goxed  is often used by Mt. Gox users to describe instances where the site has gone offline or experienced other technical issues.
The group also reportedly posted a 716 megabyte file to Karpeles  personal website that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox s servers about the organisation s finances.
The hackers said it shows the company has a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins, and have used it to pour scorn on Mt. Gox s assertion that users  money had been lost.
Karpeles was unresponsive to requests for comment from Forbes, and   at the time of writing   the hackers  claims were still awaiting verification.
In the meantime, industry watchers have started questioning why no evidence has been uncovered to date about how the stolen Bitcoins are being spent, fuelling speculation they may not have been stolen at all.

RPT-Mt. Gox files for U.S. bankruptcy protection
FULL COVERAGE:
INDIA ELECTIONS 2017
March 10 Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. Bankruptcy in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily put U.S. legal action on hold against the Japanese company.
The company said without U.S. bankruptcy protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in Chicago federal court.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan in February after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers bitcoins.

Mt. Gox Shielded From U.S. Suits During Japan Bankruptcy
Steven Church
Mt. Gox Co., the Bitcoin exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo after millions of dollars  worth of virtual currency vanished from customer accounts, won a temporary halt to lawsuits it faces in the U.S.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas today agreed to shield the company s assets from creditors and halt two suits, both of which are in their early stages. The company will return to court April 1 to seek to extend the protection until the Japanese case is resolved.
The Tokyo-based exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after losing Bitcoins worth about $473 million at the time. The company said in its U.S. filing that almost 750,000 customer Bitcoins and 100,000 of its own, about 7 percent of all Bitcoins in existence worldwide, were missing and probably stolen.
 The facts known to date indicate that it was caused or related to a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies Bitcoin, and  hacking  attacks of one or more persons,  Mt. Gox Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles said in a sworn statement filed in the Dallas court.
The exchange was founded in 2011, two years after Bitcoins first appeared. Shortly after it opened in July of that year, hackers attempted to break into the system or shut it down with so-called denial of service attacks, according to court papers.
Federal Probe
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are probing possible criminal violations tied to the shutdown of Mt. Gox, two people familiar with the matter said last month. The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the digital currency, said last month that it briefed federal prosecutors about possible theft at Mt. Gox.
A spokeswoman for Bharara, Jennifer Queliz, today declined to comment on whether a software flaw would effect a federal investigation, citing the office s policy to neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation.
Last month, Mt. Gox was sued in federal court in Chicago by an Illinois resident accusing it of misappropriation and fraud. The company also faces a $75 million breach-of-contract suit filed by CoinLab Inc. in Washington state.
Mt. Gox filed for creditor protection yesterday in federal court in Dallas under Chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which can be used to shield assets while the main bankruptcy proceeding is carried out in another country. The petition listed about $37.7 million in assets and $63.9 million in liabilities.
Jed MacCaleb, who built the initial Mt. Gox software, owns 12 percent of the company. Tibanne Co., a Japanese company, owns the rest, according to court documents.
The U.S. bankruptcy is In re MtGox Co., 14-bk-31229, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). The Illinois lawsuit is Greene v. Mt. Gox Inc., 14-cv-01437, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago).

Mt. Gox, which used to be the world s largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection late Sunday.
The Japan-based company filed for bankruptcy in a Dallas court, according to Reuters . By seeking bankruptcy, it hopes to avoid extensive legal costs stemming from a class-action suit filed against the company in Chicago.

The company has already filed for bankruptcy in its home nation.

The company eventually said weaknesses in its system had allowed hackers to
At the time it closed its doors, Mt. Gox had been home to roughly 750,000 bitcoins, worth about $470 million at the time.
The high-profile collapse has led to fresh scrutiny of the new currency, and even has attracted some attention in Washington.

Hackers Accuse Mt. Gox Bitcoin Of Fraud After Hack
7:44 am
By Roland Hutchinson
Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange shut down recently after the company claimed that their service was hacked, and hundreds of millions of dollars worth of its customers Bitcoin s were stolen.
Now it looks like Mt. Gox may have been hacked again, although according to a recent report, what was taken from the exchange this time was data.
According to Forbes, the hackers who carried out the latest attack on Mt. Gox are accusing the company of fraud, and have alleged that MT. Gox actually kept some of the Bitcoins that were previously reported as stolen.
The hackers have said that they have found a balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which they claim are owned by Mt. Gox, and these Bitcoins were apparently reported as stolen in the previous Hack.
They also published personal details, including the home address of the Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, there has been no comment from anyone from Mt. Gox as yet regarding the allegations.

MtGox chief executive Mark Karpeles announces his company's request for bankruptcy protection, blaming "a weakness in our system."Reuters
Hackers have stolen account transaction information from beleaguered Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.
The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.
The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called "Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!" and posted the stolen information there.
The information was contained in a 716 megabyte file which includes an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades as well as an internal SQl database administration tool and even Karpeles' own CV.
A note on the file add: "That fat f**k has been lying!!" The hackers also took over the Reddit account of Karpeles and posted the information there too. Reddit moderators have since removed the post, which said: "It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed."
Scam exposed
Despite the removal of the post, users of the bitcoin subreddit have made their position very clear, with one of the top posts on the forum saying:
"Mt. Gox scam was just exposed   MK [Mark Karpeles] officially stole our funds."
Karpeles has so far not responded to the claims.
The hackers added that the bitcoin community could use the relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialised tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data from the given download link to help expose what really went on at Mt. Gox.
The hackers have redacted any user details from the files.

Collapsed
Last month Japan-based MtGox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to a hack - 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. Two weeks ago, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan.
The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m,  38m,  46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.
The Tokyo-based company was the largest and most well-known bitcoin exchange in the world when the cryptocurrency shot to fame last year.
The exchange claims that problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins than were being recorded by the exchange.
Known as " transaction malleability ", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.
The exchange's collapse led to the price of bitcoin crashing but the virtual currency has shown remarkable resilience and the price of the cryptocurrency has bounced back and is currently trading at  381 on the Coindesk index.

Over the weekend, hackers stole the database of the failed Bitcoin exchange MtGox , hijacked the blog and Reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles   and published the former via the latter. The data appears to show that MtGox did not have all its bitcoins cleaned out by hackers, as it claimed when it went bankrupt.
 Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data,  the hackers wrote in the document they published. No user data was included, but some of those  specialized tools  linked to in the document turned out to be Bitcoin wallet-stealing malware (taken down by the host, once Redditors notified it.)

If you can t trust an angry cryptocurrency-fanatic hacker to dump a risk-free executable file into the wild, who can you trust?
Sarcasm aside, the leaked information appears to bolster the case of those who suspect Karpeles of defrauding his customers. The way Karpeles and his lawyers told it, hackers had stolen 750,000 bitcoins belonging to MtGox s customers and 100,000 belonging to the exchange itself, supposedly leaving nothing.
According to the data leaked on the weekend, MtGox actually still has 951,116 bitcoins. This detail is accompanied in the document by a strongly-worded suggestion that Karpeles has been less than honest. One bitcoin is currently worth around $620, so that would be roughly $590 million worth.
That said, by MtGox s version of events, the exchange only recently noticed that the 850,000 bitcoins had been stolen a long time   perhaps even years   ago. There s no evidence that the outfit ever conducted a proper audit of what it did and didn t actually hold, so the possibility remains that the information leaked over the weekend is just plain wrong.
Either way, that s not even the end of the risky business floating around the MtGox collapse. The exchange also put out a notice on Saturday, warning that its former users were being targeted by spam/phishing emails, dressed up to look like MtGox emails and asking for MtGox and bank account details.
 We highly recommend not to respond to these emails,  MtGox said in the notice. That much, certainly, is true.

Hackers Claim Mt. Gox Sat on 'Stolen' Bitcoin

(Newser)                                   Hackers say the now-bankrupt Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has been less than honest about money lost in a major security lapse . Yesterday, they hacked into CEO Mark Karpeles' blog and Reddit account, announcing that the company had kept currency it claimed was stolen, Forbes reports. They said they'd hacked Mt. Gox's servers, and posted a file full of data suggesting the exchange had a balance of 951,116 bitcoins. Hackers say that points to fraud after the company claimed it lost 750,000 of users' bitcoins.
The authenticity of the document isn't entirely clear, though some Reddit posters noted that personal account information revealed in the file appeared accurate, CNET notes. Still, it's possible that the balance shows money that was already lost in the security breach, reflecting bad accounting rather than theft, the Verge reports. Meanwhile, a bitcoin forum user said he or she was trying to sell 20 gigabytes of stolen information from Mt. Gox a database that holds user details, including passport scans. "Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses (sic) from gox closure," the user said. The price: 100 bitcoins, or some $63,000, Forbes notes.

Hacked bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the US, having already filed in Japan last month, and seen its CEO s blog vandalized with claims of exactly how much of investors  virtual cash was lost . The bankruptcy filing, on Sunday, March 9th, follows revelations by Mt. Gox that hackers broke into its digital vaults and drained them, leaving the Japanese company $63.6m in debt.
The Japanese bankruptcy filing was made on February 28th, MarketWatch reports, but now has been extended to a US filing under Chapter 15. That s the part of the bankruptcy process which facilitates representatives of non-US companies from accessing the US legal system, such as when assets in the US are at stake.
Whether that will mean US investors who had their bitcoins holdings stored with Mt. Gox will ever see any of their money back is unclear at this stage.
Also unclear is just how much was stolen. Mt. Gox originally declared 744,408 bitcoins had been taken, but documents acquired by hackers over the weekend claim the figure is more like 951,116. The alleged numbers   as well as other details   were posted to Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles  own blog.
 We stole no bitcoins  the hackers added.  There were none to steal.

'Hacked docs' prove MtGox has 1 MILLION Bitcoins, claim blog-snatchers
Firm files in US for Chap 15 bankruptcy as creditors gather
10 Mar 2014 at 14:22, Jasper Hamill
Hackers have released what they claim are genuine documents which they say prove the stricken exchange still controls almost a million Bitcoins.
As Bitcoin exchange MtGox was filing for bankruptcy in the US on Sunday, a group of hackers took over MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog , which has since been taken down, and posted a 716MB file they claimed they had snatched from MtGox's servers.
Although the document's veracity cannot be confirmed, it suggested the exchange was still in possession of 951,116 Bitcoins.
MtGox's US bankruptcy case was filed under Chapter 15, which is used to handle bankruptcy cases where parties are based in more than one country. This comes two weeks after the exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan.
 It s time that MtGox got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,  the hackers wrote .
However, even if the leaked docs are genuine, it does not necessarily prove wrongdoing. It is still unclear what exactly happened to MtGox that caused it to file for bankruptcy protection . It may be that its systems still show a huge balance even though the Bitcoins have all disappeared, because any theft may not been properly recorded.
MtGox also released a statement (PDF) warning former users of a number of phishing attacks that may be directed at them.
Meanwhile, Dorian Nakamoto, the man Newsweek controversially accused of being the inventor of Bitcoin, has kept a dignified silence whilst the world frantically debates whether or not he was wrongly identified as the creator of the cryptocurrency.
Someone claiming to be Dorian's brother Arthur Nakamoto   who was supposedly quoted in the Newsweek article   took to Reddit and issued various bizarre statements about the alleged Bitcoin brainbox.
"Mis-quoting and blatant lies are unfortunately the journalistic world that exist today," the other supposed Nakamoto wrote. "I am just a humble handsome Asian man who is confused as to how a female asshole can become transferred onto my brother's rear end. But I saw with my own eyes from released video that there is a surgeon operating without an ethical or moral license to do exactly that."
He added: "I understand that I will be mis-quoted and that I will be made out to be the brother who is the asshole remark guy. What I wanted to do is to plead to allow Dorian to live whatever life he has left to live it in dignity, peace and in private. To let him play with his trains and obsess over being treated to free lunches that he craves for some reason since his stroke. What's a real bitch (I am welling with tears right now) is that I cannot physically go to to see him and my mother to be of family support or call for fear of my immediate family being in physical danger."

Mt. Gox files for bankruptcy in U.S.
The Japan-based Bitcoin exchange files Chapter 15 bankruptcy paperwork in the U.S. in efforts to protect its remaining assets, while opening up international channels of co-operation.
| Topic: Tech Industry
Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the United States.
The once-dominant Bitcoin trading post filed for Chapter 15 in the U.S. on Sunday . This particular chapter of the U.S. bankruptcy code deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country.
On 28 February, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. However, by filing for Chapter 15 in the United States, foreign debtors and parties are able to use the U.S. Bankruptcy Courts and systems. This means that Mt. Gox's insolvency now reaches beyond the confines of Tokyo, and the U.S. is able to work with other countries and connected parties around the world in order to better solve the case and protect the interests of all creditors as well as Mt. Gox and its remaining assets.

As Mt. Gox accounts for investors worldwide, it makes sense that this secondary bankruptcy filing has occurred. Through Chapter 15, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court will generally defer to the actions of a foreign court -- in this case, in Japan, as the primary place for bankruptcy procedures. However, when circumstances do not violate laws or public policy in the U.S., Chapter 15 also allows aid to be offered to the foreign company filing for bankruptcy protection.
The Bitcoin exchange shut down abruptly last month, closing its Twitter feed and rendering itself mute for over a week before announcing that Mt. Gox was closing its doors. In total, according to Mt. Gox's announcement that it was filing for  Japanese bankruptcy protection  (.PDF), approximately 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 Bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox disappeared, which is worth roughly $500 million in today's trading rates.
Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles said the loss --  taking place over several years  -- was due to "weaknesses in the system" which allowed cyberattacks and Bitcoin theft to occur.
Over the weekend , anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to Mt. Gox systems and lifted apparent evidence that customer investments were not the target of theft, but instead are still being held at the exchange as part of a fraudulent plot by Mt. Gox management.

MtGox boss Mark Karpeles has been targeted by hackers following the company's recent bankruptcy protection filing .
The Bitcoin magnate's personal blog and Reddit account were breached, resulting in information about the exchange's trading activities being posted online.

The leaked material includes an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million transactions, entries from the firm's business ledger and details about its admin software.
"It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed," said the hackers in a statement accompanying the data dump.
MtGox went dark last month after 744,000 Bitcoins - worth around  210 million - were reportedly stolen via a security loophole.
It remains unclear whether the information leaked by hackers was genuine and sheds any light on the incident, according to Forbes .

So Where Are Mt Gox's Stolen Bitcoin Millions?
So Where Are Mt Gox's Stolen Bitcoin Millions?
Now anonymous hackers believe they have the answer   they're still in Mt Gox. "On Sunday," reports Forbes , "hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users."
The blog has since been taken down, but the hackers' message is available on Pastebin . "It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data."
The message provides a link to a zip file. "Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included."
The hackers also provide what they claim to be the balances of virtual currencies still existent    and it includes more than 950,000 bitcoins. This alone is proof of nothing. Forbes points out, "I couldn t verify that Sunday s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the 'lying' that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves."
Nevertheless, the lack of movement for the stolen bitcoins has puzzled the community. On Friday, however, writing in Coindesk , Danny Bradbury noted that a wallet most likely owned by Mt Gox had started to be active. This wallet had been dormant until July 2012, when it started receiving small transactions. "However," writes Bradbury, "no coins left that wallet, until today, when its 50,000 bitcoins were sent to another address, as part of outputs from various bitcoin addresses totaling 180,000 bitcoins ($113 million)."
Since then, he continues, "these coins have been rapidly splitting, with coins being subdivided repeatedly. One branch was found to have been splitting every 30 minutes in what appeared to be an automated fashion. This suggests that there may be some code splitting the coins."
Why this is happening is not so clear. "One explanation is that it makes the coins easier to use for a high volume of transactions," suggests Bradbury. Another possibility, of course, is that it also makes them harder to trace. 
It is not absolutely clear that the bitcoins concerned are still 'owned' by Mt Gox, but bitcoin developer Gregory Maxwell suggests they are. "Maxwell also argued that the splitting behavior is consistent with a function in the leaked source code from Mt Gox," writes Bradbury. "This suggests that some of the coins have been dropped into the Mt Gox online wallet, and that the system is now automatically breaking them up, he said."
One thing is clear: the Mt Gox debacle is still posing more questions than it is providing answers.

Anonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles lied about the theft of more than $500 million worth of bitcoin. 
According to the hackers, Karpeles still controls all of the cryptocurrency he says was stolen recently in the biggest heist of bitcoin s brief history. Mt. Gox was the world s largest bitcoin exchange until about 850,000 bitcoin were allegedly stolen during a breach, forcing the exchange to shut down and file for bankruptcy protection. 
According to new claims from anonymous hackers, however, the heist never occurred and Karpeles still controls nearly 1 million bitcoin worth approximately $596 million at Monday s exchange rate.
According to a report from Forbes , the anonymous hackers took over Karpeles s blog and published a post supposedly exposing fraud committed by the CEO. The post was also published on Pastebin .
 It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] bitcoin community getting Goxed,  the hackers wrote.  This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of [our] ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than [we] would have liked to verify the data.

*Mark Karpeles, CEO Mt. Gox (Bloomberg)
A group of hackers told Forbes that they ve broken into Mt. Gox servers in order to bring to light what actually happened in the days leading up to the company s bankruptcy filing, which left its customers without hundreds of millions of bitcoins. Mt. Gox has not been forthcoming with the Bitcoin community apart from attributing the closure to a massive hacker attack.
 Hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users,  said Forbes. Reddit moderators removed the hackers  post soon after it was posted saying that stolen material was not permitted in the subforum, but the community had already been drawing its own conclusions.
In its three-year history, Mt. Gox customers experienced technical difficulties so often   delayed trades, suspended withdrawals and offline issues   that users started using the term  goxed  to describe user issues:  You ve been goxed! 
The hackers accessed a massive database and 716 megabyte file detailing over a million trades, among other things , and posted it to Karpeles  personal website. According to Forbes:  In the hackers  summary of Mt. Gox s balances in various currencies, they point to a claimed balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which they take as evidence that Mark Karpeles  claim to have lost users  digital currency to hackers is fraudulent.  That fat fuck has been lying!!  a note in the file reads. 
Bitcoin experts haven t seen the movement of the 850,000 bitcoins that Mt. Gox claims to have lost in its bankruptcy filing. The coins should be accessible on the public transaction ledger meant to prevent fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy.
Forbes reporter, Andy Greenberg , said that as of yet he has been unable to verify the hackers  claims.  I couldn t verify that Sunday s database dump was real, or that it showed any of the  lying  that the hackers claimed. In fact, it may simply show how Mt. Gox s accounting mismatched with its actual store of Bitcoins   that it was counting bitcoins as being safe in its coffers when they had already been stolen by thieves.

Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key
Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.
They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox s claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.
Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.

Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.
Karpeles  blog was titled  Magical Tux in Japan Geekness brought me to Japan!  Karpeles, who is French, often used the nickname  MagicalTux  when posting on public message or chat forums. His blog went offline on Sunday shortly after it was attacked.

Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.
The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users  personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.
The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles  CV and a Windows executable called  TibanneBackOffice,  among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.
The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.
Mt. Gox s demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin s public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.
One of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.
Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.
The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin s core software who ve said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.
Follow the money
Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.
The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user s public bitcoin  address  or  wallet,  which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.
Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox s bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.
In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.
At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.
The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million.
Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.
 There s a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it s very, very difficult, and it s tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it s just obvious,  he said.
The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cybercrime thefts on record.
An academic pape r published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.
 For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange,  they wrote.
Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.
 A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money,  said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization.  This is serious money for serious people. 
Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.
If that s the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.

Summary
Bitcoin s volatility makes it an unreliable medium for financial transactions.
A Bitcoin-generated free market system becomes an inherently adversarial process, pitting the best interests of the buyer against the best interests of the seller.
Rising concerns about the security of the Bitcoin software indicate that its economic system is vulnerable to externalities.
Bitcoin may actually violate the principles of the free market economy that it purports to establish.
There are two ways to look at Bitcoin: as an investment opportunity and as a virtual currency. As an investment, one is buying "shares" in a pecuniary transaction system - a software-driven enterprise developed to provide users with a regulation-free, totally "libertarian," economy. As a virtual economy, Bitcoin provides a currency (the bitcoin), the value of which is mediated by the marketplace, rather than by a government, and that is not subject to legislative control and political manipulation.1
The beautiful simplicity of the whole concept is that the two functions - investment and currency - are bound inextricably in the same instrumentality: the bitcoin. In this way, the value of a bitcoin is tied to the desirability of participating in the Bitcoin economic system; that the value of a bitcoin is tied to its desirability is essentially guaranteed by the fact that, ultimately, there will be only 21 million bitcoins in existence, and with constancy of supply, the only variable in the worth of the "commodity" (the bitcoin) is its desirability (or, its demand).2
I have a problem with Bitcoin. It would seem that one should be disinclined to place one's trust in a "currency" the value of which is fundamentally dependent upon the enthusiasm of its adherents. Because of the volatility in a bitcoin's value, it introduces a measure of unfairness into the marketplace. That unfairness, coupled with growing concerns about security issues within the Bitcoin system seems to make Bitcoin an inferior alternative to fiat currencies.
The Subjective Value of Bitcoins
Fiat currency (such as the U.S. dollar) derives its value from the fact that it has a government backing it up. The government establishes and guarantees the value of the currency it issues. It is the stability in its assigned objective value that enables the fiat currency to be used as a transactional medium.
The pecuniary worth of bitcoins is based on subjective value - that is, their value is dependent upon what the bitcoin purchaser is willing to pay for it, and that subjective value is a complex assemblage of personal attitudes that contribute to the deliberative process as one decides just what value one is willing to assign to the bitcoin.
The responsibility for the variability in the monetary value of bitcoins is the conflation of monetary value with investment price that occurs in Bitcoin. The resultant valuation of bitcoins, thus, tends to be subject to periods of volatility. Consider the following chart3, which traces bitcoin price from July 18, 2010 through March 5, 2014:
On July 18, 2010, a bitcoin was worth $0.09, and on December 4, 2013, that same bitcoin was worth $1,147.25 - a 1.25-million percent increase in value. Barely more than three months later, on March 5, 2014, that bitcoin was worth $661.79 - a 43% drop from the December high. Serious fluctuations in the value of bitcoins did not occur until early 2013.
Bitcoin Transactions
If all bitcoins had a standard value, there would be no question but that any transaction involving bitcoins would be fair and equitable. If, for instance, bitcoins were worth $500.00 (and set at that value), buying a bitcoin would be a matter of paying $500 to the bitcoin exchange and getting the one-bitcoin amount added to one's account. A person buying something for $100 would spend 20% of his bitcoin's value to do so, and the seller would receive 20% of a bitcoin's value in exchange for the item sold.
It should be noted that all bitcoin transactions take place in terms of the fiat currency in which the seller participates - to effect the transaction, the current value of a bitcoin must be determined, the amount needed to conduct the transaction is determined, that amount is transferred from the buyer's account to the seller's account, once in the seller's account it is registered as (a portion of) a bitcoin.4
Since all bitcoins (in the scenario) are of a standard value, all transactions would be like this - both buyer and seller would be conducting business under purely equitable currency valuations. In the kind of transaction described above, the bitcoin functions - for all intents and purposes - like a fiat currency.
Unfortunately, a transaction such as the one described can only occur in reality if (1) both buyer and seller acquired their bitcoins at the same price, and (2) the transaction takes place at a time when bitcoins are valued at the same price as that at which both buyer and seller acquired theirs.
Transactional Dilemma, Part I: Let the Buyer Beware
In the "real" world of the virtual currency, however, the value of a bitcoin changes - literally from one minute to the next. A person ("X") buys a bitcoin at the rate of $550.00 per bitcoin. Later that day, X visits a local electronics store that transacts in bitcoin, and finds an excellent Tablet PC for $275.00. A quick calculation informs him that that is one-half bitcoin at the rate at which he made his recent purchase.
Transaction 1: As X informs the seller ("Y") that he wants to buy the tablet using bitcoin, Y begins the transaction. It is discovered that at the time of the transaction, the bitcoin is worth only $500.00 - an approximately 9% loss of value in terms of dollars. This being the case, the tablet will cost X 55% of his bitcoin, essentially a 10% increase in price compared to the original purchase price of the bitcoin (55% of the original bitcoin value is $302.50).
Transaction 2: Of course, things could work out differently for X. Suppose, as the transaction is taking place, the value of a bitcoin is $600.00 - a 9% increase in bitcoin value. In this case, X pays just over 45% of a bitcoin, and since 45% of the original bitcoin value equals $247.50, X gets what amounts to a 10% discount on the tablet.
Based on the above considerations, we can generalize: The Buyer should always prefer to transact when his bitcoins are worth more than he paid for them (i.e., when bitcoins have appreciated in value).
Transactional Dilemma, Part II: Seller's Remorse
Things work quite differently for the seller in our example. Y does business in U.S. currency, so for him, there is no preference in terms of the bitcoin rate at the time of the transaction with X (at least, on the face of it).5 We may suppose that Y has a profit margin of 5% on his electronic equipment, so that the sale of the tablet represents a profit of $13.75; the remaining $261.25 represents fixed costs (his cost for the tablet, plus overheads).
Transaction 1a: According to the above scenario for transaction 1, Y receives .55 bitcoin. At some point, Y will want to exchange his bitcoin for fiat currency, either for his own use or to use for business expenses. Suppose that when he goes to exchange the .55 bitcoin he received from X the exchange rate has dropped to $475.00. In this case, Y's bitcoin is worth $261.25 - the 5% drop in the bitcoin rate has effectively eliminated Y's profit for the tablet.6
Transaction 1b: Suppose that the exchange rate for Y has gone up since the sale, and bitcoins are valued at $525.00. Y's .55 bitcoin is now worth $288.75. After accounting for his fixed costs, Y is left with a profit of $27.50, or double his usual profit.
Transaction 2a: In transaction 2, above, Y receives .45 bitcoin. If the exchange rate is $475.00 when Y seeks to collect his dollars, he realizes only $213.75 - not only costing him his profit, but also causing him an additional loss of $47.50, or 18% of his fixed costs.
Transaction 2b: Now suppose that the exchange rate for the bitcoin is $525.00. Y's .45 bitcoin is worth $236.25 - certainly more than he realizes in 2a, but he still loses not only his profit, but comes up $25.00 short in covering his fixed expenses (an almost 10% loss).
Generalizing on these considerations: It is always in the Seller's interest to seek the greatest amount of bitcoin in any transaction (i.e., transact when bitcoins have depreciated in value).
The Adversarial Economy
It is a principle of free markets that buyer and seller meet and come to a mutually agreed-upon basis for exchange. Fundamental to the concept of such an exchange is that there is some way that the needs of the seller and the needs of the buyer can be made compatible. If that compatibility cannot be achieved, the transaction does not take place (at least, in principle).
In light of the set of examples I've just presented and the two generalizations that were drawn therefrom, it would seem to follow that Bitcoin, as it is currently conceived, may not produce a truly free market wherein both buyer and seller can come to agreement as to the conditions of a transaction. It will always be in the interest of the buyer to transact with the highest valuation achievable of the transactional medium (the bitcoin), and it will always be in the interest of the seller to transact with the lowest valuation achievable of that same medium.
In short, it would seem that a Bitcoin economy would be - as it is currently conceived - an adversarial economy, where buyer and seller are both committed to strategies that are mutually incompatible and would inhibit the possibility of reaching the agreement that characterizes a free market.
I believe that the reason Bitcoin economics reaches this fundamental standoff is because it seems not to acknowledge an important aspect of investment: cost basis. Any rational investor is bound to consider the costs involved in making an investment. That cost basis is the measure against which capital gains (and losses) are determined, and - ultimately - what determines whether the investment was worth the undertaking. And since Bitcoin is both an investment and a system of currency, it needs to be mindful of the expectations people have both as investors and as participants.
What it costs the individual to partake in a particular investment is part and parcel of the ultimate rationality of pursuing that investment. To ignore the relevance of cost basis is to neglect the very fundamental principle upon which the acceptability of free market economics is dependent: it is always rational for an individual to be motivated to seek the maximum gains for the minimum costs. Like it or not, in its current form, Bitcoin is fundamentally anchored to fiat currencies inasmuch as those currencies are the means by which Bitcoin acquires its users and conducts transactions.
Summary and Addendum about Security
The considerations I have presented are products of my thinking. I may be wrong on some things, but I think not. In any event, it is important that potential and current investors in Bitcoin have access to all information available, and that they be exposed to various perspectives of the Bitcoin enterprise. It is not my intention to discourage anyone from participating in the Bitcoin enterprise.
Since the fiasco of Mt. Gox, it has become clear that there are serious security issues to be had with the software that serves as the foundation for Bitcoin. One such issue is transaction malleability, which involves the manipulation of the digital signatures that are used to generate the IDs that identify each transaction occurring on the Bitcoin network. By doing so, transactions can be "lost," with a resultant loss of bitcoin. Bitcoin programmers have known about malleability issues since 2011, but have not been able to completely eradicate the problem as yet.7
On March 5, 2014, it was reported that two bitcoin sites suffered significant losses of digital currency by flooding accounts with transfers between users' accounts before the accounts could be updated; the thieves would then close out their own account (loaded with the transferred coins). Canadian bitcoin bank, Flexcoin suffered the loss of all of its digital currency with a total value approaching $600,000.00; Flexcoin has gone out of business. Poloniex, another bitcoin exchange, lost 12.3% of its digital currency; Poloniex plans to devalue all users' accounts by 12.3%, since precise records indicating which accounts actually lost coinage have not been found.8
Given the security issues that seem to be becoming rife with the open-source software, it seems to some degree irresponsible to attempt to continue doing business. Further, given the fact that open-source software can be altered by users, it would seem to be difficult, if not impossible, to guarantee that all users in the system can be made secure - at least, until standardized software is developed that addresses the security issues and is made mandatory for all users.
It is no wonder that it is now possible to "short" bitcoin, just as one could short any currency.9
1 I follow the convention of using the word "Bitcoin" (capital "B") to refer to the system, and the word "bitcoin" (small "b") to refer to the currency.
2 Alternatively, it is considered a serious flaw of Bitcoin by Anthony Alfidi here that constancy of supply will result in a stagnant economy, because Bitcoin would be unable to generate new capital for growth. I think it is not as limited as some might argue. If the value of a bitcoin is dependent upon its desirability, even if the number of bitcoins is constant, their value should be variable according to the elasticity of demand.
3 The data used in constructing the chart is from CoinDesk, here .
4 This is admittedly a rough characterization. The bitcoin transactions I refer to are according to bitpay.com , a company that provides merchants with the software and data needed to conduct bitcoin transactions. The price is what bitpay.com calls its "Bitcoin Best Bid" ("BBB") - the best rate available from exchanges with "adequate liquidity" and withdrawal capability in the U.S. and eurozone. Rates are updated every minute.
5 A quick survey of some of the websites that will accept bitcoin as payment shows that they list their prices in dollars, relying on a transaction facilitator (such as bitpay.com) to manage bitcoin transactions for them.
6 Please note that in all of these transactions, I do not include transaction fees. While the absence of fees is often used as a selling point for Bitcoin, it is understood that exchanges and other intermediaries are free to charge for their services. A quick review showed that most agencies do charge a small service fee for at least some services.
7 Danny Bradbury, for instance, discusses this issue for CoinDesk, here ; it has also been acknowledged by Gavin Andresen of the Bitcoin Foundation in his blog, here .
8 Information about the "withdrawal vulnerabilities" at the facilities is described by Lucian Constantin for PCWorld, here ; details of Poloniex's recovery strategy are outlined by Cyrus Farivar for ars technica, here .
9 The process must be undertaken using an exchange that will transfer between bitcoins and other currencies, and the process is described here .

But don't go clicking any links found in the spreadsheet the hackers posted, for There Be Trojans.
Update: Mt Gox has filed for US bankruptcy protection. CEO Karpales says, in the statement accompanying the bankruptcy protection documents , that it would "allow Mt Gox a necessary breathing period for it to focus on its restructuring efforts without the distraction that would result if certain litigation currently pending in the United States were allowed to proceed."
According to Karpales, Mt Gox has $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets. Karpales also claims that the hack which took down Mt Gox stole approximately 7% of the world's Bitcoin supply.
Source: Ars Technica
Original Story:
One of the things that's been puzzling the Bitcoin community is, if the Mt Gox wallet really was emptied by person or persons unknown, where did all the coins go? You'd think a transaction of that size would show up in the public ledger of transactions, runs the theory. Those of you following all things Bitcoin related may remember that other self-appointed investigators followed a very similar theory searching for Sheep Marketplace's Bitcoin, with dismal results . Now some of Mt Gox's customers have hacked the personal blog and Reddit account of Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpales, posting what they claim is evidence of fraud. Or, as they prefer to put it, evidence that they've been Goxed.
The hackers posted messages, since removed from Karpales' blog and Reddit, claiming that they had discovered where Karpales stored the loot. The hackers claim Karpales kept back 951,116 Bitcoin, though this claim may not be all it seems.
For one, as Forbes points out, the spreadsheet posted by the hackers may simply indicate how badly Mt Gox dropped the ball; that all those figures show is what Mt Gox thought it had, not what it actually possessed.
For another, the information posted seems to be infested with Trojans . The posts included genuine Mt Gox data mixed in with a healthy helping of .exe and Mac.app files, some of which are actually Bitcoin stealing viruses disguised as back office tools. Should you go looking for the files yourself, you're advised not to open them.
One poster says that the data was obtained by installing a rootkit months ago on one of Mt Gox's servers via known Gentoo Linux distribution flaws, and the installation was successful because Karpales didn't bother to update. This same poster, nanashi, claimed to have access to much of Mt Gox's customer data in a 20GB stolen database, possibly including bank details, passwords, usernames, even passport scans. Nanashi offered this database for sale for 100 Bitcoin.  "Selling it one or two times to make up personal loses from gox closure," he says.

Australian Bitcoin traders burnt in Mt.Gox crash

Ruth Liew
Former Macquarie banker Joe Lee and Wall Street investment adviser George Samman suspected something was wrong with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox in the closing months of 2013.
The founders behind Singapore-based derivatives trader BTC.sx had begun withdrawing money as early as December, fearing the premium Mt.Gox users paid for Bitcoins was a sign of liquidity issues at the Tokyo-based exchange.
But it didn t stop Lee and Samman from sustaining a six-figure loss when Mt.Gox finally went under last month.
 We were one of Mt.Gox s biggest customers but we got no inside  information from them at all," says  Samman, chief operating officer at the trader.  They couldn t answer any questions so it was useless. We were lucky to get off what we needed to get off before the whole thing went down."

In Melbourne, 22-year-old Bitcoin trader Karl Kloppenborg was also burned by the fall of Mt.Gox.

 I realised something was wrong much earlier on   I threatened legal action, and said I d call the banks," he says.  It became a waiting game when I realised that the money was essentially frozen."
Series of Bitcoin problems
The failure of Bitcoin s most public face is just one in a series of hiccups for the fast-rising virtual currency, after raids on online black market SilkRoad, which dealt solely in Bitcoins, and the purported unmasking of Bitcoin s mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto (later denied by Nakamoto).
For a mathematical code which has seen its value rise from several US  dollars to the thousands in just five years   to be worth $US10 billion at its height   the loss of 744,000 Bitcoins (worth $527 million at Monday s average exchange rate) was no doubt a shock to Bitcoin users, many of whom dedicated their trust to the service.
And the community is no doubt outraged. Despite statements from Mt.Gox that the loss was a theft, resulting from flaws in the system s code, those demanding vigilante justice have attacked the online accounts of Mt.Gox s former chief
Mark Karpeles
, publishing his personal information and the purported bank balance of the company in 18 different currencies, including nearly $A1 million.
The information has fuelled speculation that Mt.Gox s collapse is more fraud than theft, but provides  little hope that users will have their Bitcoins returned.
In an email trail seen by The Australian Financial Review between  Kloppenborg and Mt.Gox staff, the exchange admitted it was unable to process  Bitcoin withdrawals quickly due to difficulty dealing with major banks.
It s a problem that Bitcoin trader David Parrish says needs to be fixed.
 It s still quite difficult to buy  Bitcoins," says Parrish, a software en gineer at Google Australia. Instead of transferring money through online exchanges, Parrish buys and sells  Bitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders.
Average price steady
However, despite a seemingly catastrophic blow to a burgeoning system, Mt.Gox s failure appeared to expose just how little an effect one exchange could have on the global system. Though Mt.Gox s own price collapsed from $US1209 to $US122 shortly before bankruptcy, the average price in the wider market has managed to sustain a $500 average since its collapse, and even risen slightly in recent weeks. Its price remains volatile but it seems those committed to Bitcoin are sticking with it.  People have been looking for reasons to not trust Bitcoin," says  Samman.  But I think it s a short-term negative and long-term positive.
 You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself. It will cause people to want to have more regulation than they have in the past."
Governments globally have salivated over the prospect of regulating the currency. Russia has banned  Bitcoin while China has restricted how banks play with the currency. Japan is contemplating rules as regulators in New York float the idea of a  Bitcoin licence.
No plans for Australian regulations
In Australia, however, Reserve Bank governor
Glenn Stevens
told a parliamentary committee on Friday that he was  not inclined to feel that we have to rush in as a regulator".
 We have seen some pretty substantial losses incurred by Bitcoin holders in a couple of jurisdictions just in recent weeks," he said.  It is a potential alternative currency so how it will hold its value is the first question. There have been countless currencies through history and the ones that survive are the ones that hold value."
Samman says BTC.sx will join the list of 127,000 creditors seeking retribution from Mt.Gox but is unsure how regulators will even tackle a corporation that deals in assets that countries do not yet recognise.
 They probably will have to tread on very careful water, the judges or whoever is involved in this bankruptcy because if they frame it in a certain way they may get a legal precedent for the legitimacy of Bitcoin," he says.

Mt. Gox underwent about 150,000 hack attacks per second for several daysReuters
Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox suffered about 150,000 hacking attacks per second for several days before its collapse last month, according to a report.
Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the exchange was hit by continued distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, during which hackers take control of computers to send large amount of data to a target, resulting in servers to crash.
The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many bitcoins were stolen from Mt. Gox, according to the newspaper.
Mt Gox, which once hosted 80% of the world's bitcoin trades, collapsed after losing about 850,000 bitcoins to DDoS attacks. The company has filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.
The company noted that its liabilities totalled 6.5bn yen ($64m,  38m,  46.5m), while it has only 3.8bn yen of assets.
Problems with the way Mt Gox's automated transaction system operates led to hackers reportedly manipulating transactions to withdraw more bitcoins.
Known as "transaction malleability", the flaw is in the way bitcoin itself is coded and has been known about since 2011, but can be fixed by making relatively simple changes to the way exchanges handle transactions.
The exchange's collapse questioned the reliability of bitcoin that suffered a plunge in prices subsequently.
Separate investigations are underway in Japan and the US against Mt. Gox.
UK-based law firm Selachii said earlier that more than 400 people are willing to join a class action in London against Mt. Gox and its owners.
Bitcoin was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers. They can be transferred without going through banks or clearing houses, reducing fees involved in the services significantly.
The digital currency gained more popularity and value as more and more merchants started accepting bitcoins, boosting investors' morale.
However, a number of adverse incidents including the Mt. Gox debacle questioned the digital currency's reliability.
Governments across the globe have made different decisions regarding businesses related to bitcoin. While some have banned all dealings in the currency, some others have come up with pro-active policies that consider bitcoin firms just like any other tax-compliant companies.

Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.

Karpeles did not immediately answer a query sent to his personal email address.
The attackers claim to have obtained database records containing transaction details from Mt. Gox. They wrote they purposely withheld users' personal data. Mt. Gox had as many as 1 million customers as of December.
The data included a screenshot of what appears to be an internal SQL database administration tool, Karpeles' CV, and a Windows executable called "TibanneBackOffice," among many others. Mt. Gox is a subsidiary of Tibanne, a company owned by Karpeles.
The release of the data adds to the mysterious circumstances around Mt. Gox, which at one time was the largest exchange for buying and selling bitcoin.
Mt. Gox's demise has enraged its out-of-pocket customers as efforts continue to derive clues from bitcoin's public ledger, called the blockchain, that might indicate the fate of its virtual currency holdings.
Mt. Gox in part blamed a security issue called transaction malleability for its bitcoin losses. In some instances, transaction malleability can allow an attacker to manipulate transaction identification numbers in order to steal bitcoins.
The long-known security problem is being addressed by the custodians of bitcoin's core software who've said it is usually only an issue if a bitcoin exchange has not coded its own software correctly.
Meanwhile, intense efforts are underway to analyze the blockchain to figure out where large stashes of bitcoins once held by Mt. Gox may have been transferred.
The blockchain records the movement of bitcoins from a user's public bitcoin "address" or "wallet," which is a 32-alphanumeric character. It is possible, for example, to attribute addresses to a person or company based on past transfers.
Adam Levine, who writes a blog dedicated to bitcoin, investigated Mt. Gox's bitcoin balances along with four colleagues. The group found two addresses, one with 90,000 bitcoins and another with 200,000, that may belong to Mt. Gox.
In a phone interview last week, Levine said those two stashes were found by analyzing a transaction Karpeles made in 2011 when Mt. Gox was pressured to prove the company was solvent.
At that time, Karpeles is believed to have moved just over 424,242 bitcoins between two Mt. Gox addresses. Since the transaction was recorded in the blockchain, it would ostensibly be proof that Mt. Gox had the bitcoins.
Levine, who wrote about their findings, cautioned though that their conclusion may not be accurate. There are a lack of technical tools to perform deep analysis of the blockchain that could make it easier to elicit more definitive conclusions, he said.
"There's a lot of technical depth, but when it comes to attributing it to individuals, it's very, very difficult, and it's tempting to draw conclusions because sometimes it seems like it's just obvious," he said.
The 850,000 bitcoins that were lost from Mt. Gox, 100,000 of which were its own, were worth an estimated $474 million. If stolen, the incident would be one of the largest cyber crime thefts on record.
An academic pape r published last year that analyzed noted thefts of bitcoins found that following a trail of bitcoins was hard if a thief used certain techniques, including splitting balances into many other addresses, but few did.
"For the thieves who used the more complex strategies, we saw little opportunity to track the flow of bitcoins (or at least do so with any confidence that ownership was staying the same), but for the thieves that did not there seemed to be ample opportunity to track the stolen money directly to an exchange," they wrote.
Because bitcoin is just five years old, law enforcement may still be just catching up with how bitcoin works, let alone honing blockchain forensic techniques.
"A lot of people think of bitcoin as funny money," said Bruce Fenton, board member of The Bitcoin Association, a nonprofit industry organization. "This is serious money for serious people."
Another possible scenario that Mt. Gox simply lost the private keys to the bitcoins, which are required to transfer the virtual currency to another address, through a hardware failure or a software error.
If that's the case, it would appear by looking at the blockchain that Mt. Gox would still have bitcoins sitting in an address known to be under its control, but transferring the bitcoins is impossible.

Hackers hit web accounts of MtGox boss
10 March 2014

Image caption Information was stolen via the web accounts of MtGox boss Mark Karpeles
Hackers have taken over some of the web accounts of Mark Karpeles - boss of the troubled MtGox Bitcoin exchange.
The attack on Mr Karpeles seems to have been motivated by growing frustration over the actions of MtGox.
Last month MtGox stopped trading and filed for bankruptcy after finding out that $465m ( 279m) in bitcoins had been lost via a security bug.
Many have called on the exchange to release more information about what happened to the lost bitcoins.
The attacks were mounted on the personal blog and Reddit account of Mr Karpeles and left the hackers in charge of both social media accounts.
The attackers used their access to grab detailed information about trading activity at MtGox. They then shared their findings by posting a 716MB file containing much of what they had found.
The material posted included an Excel spreadsheet of more than one million trades, entries from MtGox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.
"It's time that MtGox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed," wrote the hackers in a message accompanying the data dump. The word "Goxed" has been used to describe the sudden interruptions in trading MtGox imposed when it was going through technical problems before its final closure.
It was not yet clear whether the information dumps were real or shed new light on what had happened at the exchange, said Forbes staff writer Andy Greenberg .
He pointed out that although $465m in bitcoins (approximately 744,000 coins) had supposedly gone astray from MtGox, no activity suggesting they had been traded had been seen in the blockchain - the central list of buying and selling that underpins the entire Bitcoin network.

US concerned about China's Great Cannon
Hackers attacked the personal blog of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday and posted what they claim is a ledger showing a balance of some 950,000 bitcoins based on records they obtained from the defunct exchange for the virtual currency.
They said the sum contradicts Mt. Gox's claim in a Japanese bankruptcy protection filing Feb. 28 that it had lost about 850,000 bitcoins.
Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox officials could immediately be reached to verify the claims.
Karpeles has maintained a low profile since the filing in Tokyo District Court. Mt. Gox, which pulled the plug on its website three days before the court filing, had announced that about 750,000 customer bitcoins it held are missing along with 100,000 of its own bitcoins and $27.3 million in customer deposits.
One of the files released by hackers claiming to have compromised Mt. Gox is a screenshot of what appears to be a SQL database tool.

Bankrupt Exchange Mt. Gox Still Has $600 Million in Bitcoins, Hackers Claim
1.2k
By Stan Schroeder
2014-03-10 11:02:35 UTC
Japan-based Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox has been dysfunctional, bankrupt and shrouded with a veil of mystery for weeks. The site's owners said in February 744,408 bitcoins were stolen due to a glitch in the Bitcoin protocol and took the site down, but updates were scarce since then.
Now, unidentified hackers claim they have data, including database dumps, that proves Mt. Gox's owners actually kept the bitcoins for themselves.
See also: The Comparative Anatomy of the Xbox One vs. PlayStation 4
According to a report by Forbes, Hackers claim to have stolen the data from Mt. Gox's servers; they also took control of CEO Mark Karpeles' Reddit account and personal blog.
"It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," hackers wrote, claiming no user database dumps have been included.
The data comprises of a spreadsheet of more than a million trades on Mt. Gox as well as a 716MB file that appears to show Mt. Gox's balance in 18 currencies, including bitcoin. The file points to a balance of 951,116 bitcoins belonging to Mt. Gox, with a note saying "That fat f*ck has been lying." At the current exchange rate on bitcoin exchange BTC-e.com , that amount of bitcoins is worth approximately $595 million.
Early reports on Reddit claim the database file is genuine, but it's hard to confirm anything at this point, especially since many of the related posts on Reddit have been deleted.
Mt.Gox did not directly respond to the incident, but it did put a warning notice over the weekend, claiming that phishing emails impersonating Mt.Gox were being sent to users and warning them not to respond to these emails.

Hackers allege Mt. Gox CEO still controls 'stolen' Bitcoin
Anonymous hackers claim to have published "evidence" of fraud conducted by Mt. Gox management.
| Topic: Tech Industry
Following the closure of Mt. Gox and the theft of Bitcoins worth millions, anonymous hackers claim to have published evidence that customer Bitcoin is not missing -- but instead is held at the heart of attempted fraud.
Last month, the  abrupt closure and week-long silence  of Mt. Gox and its team frustrated, confused and angered investors. Once the dominant trading post for the cryptocurrency, Mt. Gox closed its doors after saying that cybercriminals managed to steal approximately 850,000 BTC, worth over $500 million, in cyberattacks taking place over several years.
Company CEO Mark Karpeles said Bitcoins were lost "due to weaknesses in the system," and while Mt. Gox has now filed for bankruptcy in Japan, thousands of users have been left out of pocket -- as well as in the dark over their investments' future.
Now embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings, Karpeles and Mt. Gox staff have gone quiet, but this hasn't stopped other parties from trying to get to the bottom of the issue. Over the weekend, anonymous hackers claimed to have broken in to the trading post and accessed to Mt. Gox data. After taking over Karpeles' blog and Reddit account over the weekend, on Pastebin , the group who broke in to the system said:
"It s time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin communities' wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data [...] Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included."
According to Forbes , the 716 megabyte file dump appears to include personal data including Karpeles  home address and resume, an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, Mt. Gox's Bitcoin balance and screenshots of the hackers' access to such information through database cracking.

Cryptocurrency News Round-Up: Mt. Gox Lies, Bitcoin Gun Store and Dogecoin on BitPay
Daily news roundup of bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and more
By David Gilbert
March 10, 2014 09:34 GMT
The debacle surrounding Mt. Gox continues to rumble on as CEO Mark Karpeles remains silent following his application for bankruptcy at the end of last month.
Over the weekend hackers released information they claim shows Karpeles continues to lie about the amount of bitcoin stolen from the exchange, however the continuing uncertainty over what exactly happened at Mt. Gox doesn't seem to have impacted the value of cryptocurrencies in general.
According to stats from CoinMarketCap.com , bitcoin's value rose 3% in the last 24 hours to $640, continuing to show resilience in the face of the Mt. Gox uncertainty. While the cryptocurrency is still some way off its high of $1,200, it is proving some naysayers wrong by remaining relatively stable in the face of widespread upheaval.
Bitcoin's relative stability has buoyed the rest of the cryptocurrency market, with 11 of the top 15 mineable cryptocurrencies showing a rise in value in the last day.
The big winner however was the eco-focused mintcoin which rose some 30% in value in the last 24 hours.
Hackers claim Mt. Gox CEO Karpeles is lying
Over the weekend hackers posted account transaction information from beleaguered Japanese bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, claiming CEO Mark Karpeles was lying about the amount of bitcoins the company had before it filed for bankruptcy.
The stolen information claims to show a ledger balance of 951,116 bitcoins, which is over 100,000 more than Karpeles claimed was stolen from his exchange when he filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on 28 February.
The hackers attacked the personal blog of Karpeles, called "Magical Tux in Japan - Geekness brought me to Japan!" and posted the stolen information there.
Karpeles is remaining silent about the accusations for now.
The bitcoin-friendly gunstore
The reputation of bitcoin was for years hampered by its connection to illicit marketplaces on the dark web - such as Silk Road - where you could anonymously buy everything from drugs to machine guns.
Now one businessman is looking to get remove that stigma by allowing people to purchase guns using bitcoin directly in its store. The firearm shop and training centre Central Texas Gunworks , based in Austin, has installed a bitcoin ATM to allow those wishing to purchase a gun using the cryptocurrency to do so.
However, unlike on the dark web, you won't be able to buy any firearms anonymously as the same paperwork and background checks required of anyone will still apply. Even online buyers can only have firearms shipped to a nearby gun store where the same legal process applies.
Dogecoin on BitPay before Litecoin
According to a comment from the CEO of Bitcoin payment processor startup BitPay, the meme-based cryptocurrency dogecoin could be the next virtual currency accepted on the platform   even before the world's second biggest cryptocurrency litecoin.
Reddit user and dogecoin enthusiast jimmy0x52 claims to have spoken to CEO of BitPay Tony Gallippi at music, film, and interactive conference SXSW which is taking place in Texas this week. Gallippi is reported to have said:
"Think about the consumer - if they have LTC [litecoin] they have BTC [bitcoin]. Doge is really popular and a whole new marketplace currency"
This is contrary to a tweet from BitPay in February, when it said: "Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow."
BitPay has yet to officially confirm its plans for accepting other cryptocurrencies, but with more than 10,000 bitcoin-accepting merchants on its books, the addition of dogecoin to a platform like BitPay could be huge for the young cryptocurrency.
Competition among cryptocurrency is important, but we do not currently have plans to accept Dogecoin. Much currency, such persistence. Wow.

When MtGox suddenly shut up show with $400 million worth of  missing  Bitcoins last month, the owners of the exchange stated that hackers were responsible for this loss. Whoever had raided MtGox has successfully exploited the transaction malleability bug to divert these funds from the exchange, or so its owners claimed. But suspicions have lingered over how true the hacker story really is, with some claiming that the owners may have simply pocketed the cash for themselves.
Now, following MtGox s unnerving silence since it made an application for bankruptcy just over a week ago, a group of hackers claims to have broken into the site s network to find out what the real story is.
According to a report in Forbes , the hacker or hackers successfully compromised Mark Karpeles  personal blog and Reddit account, before using these two platforms to post  evidence  that the MtGox CEO still had access to some of the missing Bitcoins. They also provided a series of files to support these claims, including a spreadsheet that details over a million Bitcoin transactions; a screenshot that appears to confirm the hackers gained access to MtGox s network; and Karpeles  home address.
The hackers also presented a file that show s MtGox s bank balance in 18 different currencies. Most tellingly, this file shows that it still has a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins   something that hackers say is  evidence  that the exchange s owners still have quite a stash of BTC. As the hacker s so eloquently point out,  That fat fuck has been lying!! 
Here s the full text of the message from the hackers:

Mt. Gox faced 150,000 DDoS attacks per second ahead of crash: Report
 
Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit
Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said Sunday.
The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.
Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.
The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.
MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.
Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.
After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.
Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.
US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.
Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.

If the leaked information is valid (and, if valid, accurate, considering Mt. Gox's vulnerability and accounting issues), it reports a sum of 951,116.21905382 Bitcoins deposited by users. During a news conference in Japan, Karpeles claimed 850,000 Bitcoins (worth around $549 million at current prices) had disappeared due to "weaknesses in the system," while bankruptcy filings claimed a debt of $63.6 million. How many Bitcoins were really left in the vault, what happened to the rest and whether or not account holders will ever get their currency back is still unknown.
Forbes points out a (now deleted) forum post that offered a 20GB Mt. Gox database file for sale at a price of 100 Bitcoins. The poster claimed it holds personal details and even passport scans of the site's users, which only adds to the concerns of anyone who had an account before the exchange shut down last month . Meanwhile, Bitcoin watchers have noticed $113 million in coins linked to Mt. Gox accounts moving through the blockchain (check out our Primed article to find out how mining and transaction verifications work) recently, which Coindesk suggests could be preparation to use them "for a high volume of transactions."

After Tokyo-based Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox reported last month that it lost nearly $500 million worth of users  bitcoins in a security lapse, many users were not convinced with the explanation from the exchange s owners.
While Mt. Gox did not provide further information about the attack, which reportedly exploited a transaction bug to divert the funds, a group of hackers claimed Sunday that they broke into Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles  personal blog, and found a discrepancy in the number of bitcoins deposited compared to the number of bitcoins Mt. Gox claimed were stolen in February's security lapse. 
According to a report from Forbes , the hackers gained access to the personal blog and Reddit account of Karpeles and posted a message, claiming that the exchange still had access to some of the bitcoins that Karpeles had reported stolen.

The hackers uploaded a series of files, including a spreadsheet of anonymous user accounts with details of bitcoin balances, Karpeles' home address, and a screenshot allegedly verifying the hackers' access to the data. In addition, the hackers also posted a 716MB zip file claimed to contain stolen data from Mt. Gox servers. Here is the link to the data on Pastebin .

The data posted by the hackers claimed that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, claiming it had lost 750,000 customer bitcoins, in addition to 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.
While the authenticity of Sunday s database dump has not yet been confirmed, some Reddit users said they had found that their personal account balances matched the data in the posting, CNET reported .

Mt. Gox CEO s Blog Hacked
By Edwin Kee on 03/09/2014 21:14 PDT
Mt. Gox, the Bitcoin exchange that has fallen from grace, has not quite reached the bottom just yet. We have just heard word that Mt. Gox s CEO, Mark Karpeles, had his personal blog that is known as MagicalTux.net , in addition to his Tumblr and Reddit accounts, hacked. The person(s) behind this particular hack also left a  MtGox2014Leak.zip  which allegedly points out  relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data.  Of course, it is highly recommended against downloading any kind of executable file from untrusted sources, but some folks who have decided to take the plunge have verified on Reddit as well as Twitter that their personal account balances, along with the data within, is available as an Excel spreadsheet, being tied in to the User ID that was part of their Mt. Gox registration e-mail.
Assuming the leaked information that has appeared is valid, apparently users have already deposited a mountainous sum of 951,116.21905382 Bitcoins. At a news conference in Japan, Karpeles laid claim that 850,000 Bitcoins (which is worth approximately $549 million at the prevailing market price) had vanished, touting a  weaknesses in the system,  with bankruptcy filings claiming a debt of $63.6 million. It remains to be seen just how many Bitcoins remain in the vault, and will account holders actually be on the receiving end of their mined currency eventually?

2014 has kind of sucked for Bitcoin but that doesn t mean that the digital currency is dead in the cyber-water. No, Bitcoin is just fine. And thanks to eBay, the most pressing problem with digital currencies may soon be solved.
The problem, to be clear, has to do with the fact that online digital currency exchanges are terribly insecure, entirely unregulated and completely uninsured. The result is that the collapse of and theft at Mt.Gox , the hacking of Flexcoin , and the breach at Poloniex have all served to damage Bitcoin s young reputation. This for no good reason   Bitcoin is not in any way to fault for the recent problems. But you wouldn t know it by listening to some popular voices; most are all too happy (and quick) to dump on Bitcoin. For example, Bill Maher.
During the New Rules segment of the most recent Real Time with Bill Maher, Maher said:
 If you invested all of your money in virtual currency, don t be surprised when it virtually disappears. Who could have predicted this? Virtually everyone.  Yes, the internet s biggest Bitcoin exchange collapsed after hackers stole all the Bitcoins. Oh no! And I was saving for a unicorn! You know, I m no fan of Citibank but I trust it more than three guys in a basement playing Dungeons and Dragons. 
Actually, Bill, they were playing Magic: The Gathering   Okay? Alright, that s neither here nor there 
On the ultra-libertarian website  The Prudent Bear , writer Martin Hutchinson gleefully wrote ,  Bad luck Millennials. Your new and clever scheme to replicate the old-fashioned virtues of gold in the cybersphere appears to have fallen apart. 
Wrong, both of you! Wrong, wrong, wrong!
This is part of a larger narrative, one that hides in the statistics of Bitcoin and other digital currencies; the people who use them are really young ! Hell, more than 90% of Bitcoiners are male and between 20-30 years old. As a result, this means that just about every person in mainstream media and economics   who have an average age of, what, roughly 3000   have no bloody clue about Bitcoin.
In the end we re left with half-baked thoughts on the subject, like Maher s  I mean, to Bill Maher: you trusted Lehman Brothers not too long ago  How did that work out for you? Was Mr. Fuld more trustworthy than three kids in a basement, or less?
And given that Bill s real money really disappeared with no real charges against real people, I wonder if he   like those who lost their Bitcoin on Mt. Gox   feels like a real idiot?
I'm off-track again...
To move in the right direction, it s important to first understand that Bitcoin is not to blame for the recent screw-ups at Mt. Gox, Poloniex, and Flexcoin; and in order to do that it only makes sense to understand why and how Bitcoin works.
So let s have at it   why and how does Bitcoin work? And what makes it so special?
The most direct answers come from the initial information paper on Bitcoin which was authored by the currency s enigmatic inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. Titled  Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System , the paper asserts a desire to eliminate large financial institutions from internet commerce.
In essence, Nakamoto views the use of third party institutions as an unnecessary expense in the age of online business. To this point Nakamoto writes,  The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions. 
Bitcoin, then, was to serve as  an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. 
And hell, the system has worked amazingly well in this capacity. While it s easy to point to the Colossus-level disaster at Mt. Gox, Bitcoin s impact on global remittance (i.e. when someone who is working abroad sends money home) has been astonishing.  Did you know that global remittance totalled between $400-520 billion USD in 2012, that most major financial institutions charge between 9-20% for money transfers, or that most Bitcoin transfer services charge 3%, or a flat rate (typically $3 USD or so) for the same service?
But this still doesn t fully explain how Bitcoin works. Sure, we ve scratched the surface of why it s useful, but how does it work?
Articles abound, I would suggest starting with the most basic primer, available on Bitcoin.org , or if you re willing to read a somewhat long, slightly biased explanation of Bitcoin, check out the article on HowStuffWorks.com . What every article is essentially explaining though is that the Peer-to-Peer structure of Bitcoin (and, in theory, digital currencies using similar code,) solves what is called the Byzantine Generals  Problem (also called the Two Generals  Problem or Byzantine fault tolerance).
By allowing computers all over the world to assist in providing hashes (essentially transactions stamps) which are then sent to what is called the block-chain (a massive public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions), the decentralized system works to ensure that each transaction between a Bitcoin holder and Bitcoin recipient is unique. As well, the nature of the relationship between the Peer-to-Peer network which is providing hashes to the block-chain is such that the ability for hackers to every disrupt the network grows more difficult as time passes.
In short, Bitcoin   through the use of cryptographic stamps, provided by a decentralized peer-to-peer based network   successfully solves the Byzantine Generals  Problem thus creating an entirely decentralized and secure network for direct business-to-consumer interactions; in theory this serves to eliminate the need for financial institutions that act as third-party operators in online commerce.
What Bitcoin doesn t do, though, is address the issues that arise when tens, hundreds, or thousands of digital currencies are on the market and people want to trade those digital currencies for other digital currencies, or for fiat currencies... And that makes a hell of a lot of sense. Bitcoin is Bitcoin; it is not every coin  To say it again, Bitcoin eliminates the need for trusted third-party institutions as far as a transaction that deal exclusively with Bitcoin.
For example, if a person mines Dogecoin, then wants to trade it in for Bitcoin, then trade the Bitcoin for Mooncoin, then to Litecoin, then back to Bitcoin, they're going to need third-party operator to help out.
Enter online exchanges.
Unlike Bitcoin, online exchanges are not decentralized; just the opposite. Online exchanges have physical and permanent addresses, physical and accessible servers, employees who maintain the security of those servers, profits and expenditures. Unlike a Bitcoin wallet that is hosted on a laptop or USB stick   to which only the user has access ( decent security measures assumed )   a wallet on an online exchange is, fundamentally, in the possession of the online exchange, and accessible to people with admin privileges or the technical capacity to breach them.
So what has happened at these fast-falling exchanges? Well, no one really knows. The best explanations available explain what clearly did not happen. If anything, the conclusion that Bill Maher came to may be closest to correct: The people running these exchanges can be shadier than Slim .
The best read I ve found on the subject,   What Did Not Happen at Mt. Gox   by hacker and Cornell Professor Emin G n Sirer, came to this fantastic conclusion;  What Nigerian scams are to your grandfather, Bitcoin exchanges are to the 20-30 semi-tech-savvy libertarian demographic. 
In other words, it s incredibly easy to be taken for a ride by the  Nigerian princes  that run these exchanges. The theft at Flexcoin, wherein $600,000 US went missing, saw the funds transfer to just two Bitcoin wallets. At Poloniex, 12.3% of Bitcoins were stolen overnight. A few people are suggesting that the breach at Mt. Gox could have been an inside job .
However, if legitimate online exchanges are able to codify a clear system by which they can assure security (or better yet, insure), this problem, like the Byzantine Generals before it, will fall.
And it looks like eBay is about to tackle the issue.
As reported on eCommerceBytes.com , eBay has filed an application that seems to hint they may be getting into the online exchange business. To quote from the patent application :
"...{We have created a system for} digital currency processing. In example embodiments, the transaction request indicating an amount in a first currency and a desired second currency is received by the currency module. A non-exhaustive and example list of currencies capable of being exchanged may include frequent flyer miles, loyalty and reward points (e.g., credit card reward points, hotel loyalty points, retail loyalty points), virtual currency, cash, Bitcoins, Facebook credits, eBay bucks, cash-equivalent currency (e.g., gift cards, travelers checks, cashier's checks), and any other form of currency "
Wouldn't that be interesting to see? My bet is that if a mega-firm like eBay launches an online exchange and markets it well, a horde of new and eager digital currency users will quickly get involved. And that bodes very well for Bitcoin, along with the countless other digital currencies out there. More legitimacy, more publicity (of the positive sort), and more opportunities to use digital currencies will all serve to increase their value.
Of course, it's worth noting safe exchanges already exist provided that you use them properly. A great first step in ensuring safety is to remember that online exchanges are not banks. It's silly and dangerous to think of them as anything other than places to make quick trades; a place where you can take your privately stored currency, trade it for another, and then return your new currency back to a private, backed-up, offline wallet.
After what has been a rough few months for Bitcoin, it's great to see that there might be huge and positive advances with regard to online exchanges in the near future; eBay or otherwise, digital currencies need better, trustworthy exchanges in order for current and future users to better trust the currencies themselves.

If there s a lesson to be learned from the bitcoin collapse, it s that just because an investment is trendy and cool, that doesn t mean you should abandon all common sense and sink your money into it.
 Digital currencies right now are very, very trendy,  said Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board.  There s a lot of buzz about them. It s really easy to look at the benefits, the positives of digital currencies, without really appreciating these risks.
 Those risks can wipe out the entirety of their investment in not months, not weeks, but in a matter of moments. 
Digital currencies like bitcoin are essentially long lines of computer code that may be encrypted and sent or received without involving a financial institution or government agency.
 In many ways, digital currencies operate as  online cash,  only this type of currency is extremely volatile and can disappear the same way your money disappears when you lose your wallet,  said John Morgan, Texas securities commissioner.
Bitcoin has become increasingly popular among tech enthusiasts, libertarians and risk-seeking investors because it allows people to buy goods and services and exchange money across borders without involving banks, credit card issuers or other third parties. Criminals like bitcoin for the same reasons.
The currency attracted media attention and the fascination of millions as an increasing number of large retailers such as Overstock.com began to accept it.
Bitcoin isn t the only digital currency that s sprung up.
 The last I checked, which was right at the beginning of this year, there were about 14 digital currencies,  Rotunda said.  There s more of them in production right now, in development. It s a real fertile ground. 
Investors must use caution when dealing with digital currencies, securities regulators said.
 Anybody who s investing in digital currencies is going to be highly dependent upon the securities systems, the infrastructure, the accounting practices, overall business model of whomever they re entrusting the custody of their investment to,  Rotunda said.
What s more, a lack of regulation of digital currencies leaves investors exposed, he said.
 Digital currencies in large part allow users to be anonymous,  Rotunda said.  That makes it hard from a regulatory standpoint to regulate those transactions, but it also fosters an environment that caters to money laundering to conceal transactions to all sorts of situations where a promoter could be playing with investors  money without their own knowledge. 
That includes Ponzi schemes. A Ponzi scheme is an investment scam that involves payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds contributed by new investors.
Ponzi scheme organizers often solicit new investors by promising to invest funds in investments that promoters claim generate high returns with little or no risk.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civil complaint last year that Trendon T. Shavers of McKinney operated a bitcoin-denominated Ponzi scheme under the name Bitcoin Savings and Trust.
The SEC alleged that from September 2011 to September 2012 Shavers raised more than 700,000 bitcoins worth about $4.5 million based on bitcoin prices then.
 We are concerned that the rising use of virtual currencies in the global marketplace may entice fraudsters to lure investors into Ponzi and other schemes in which these currencies are used to facilitate fraudulent, or simply fabricated, investments or transactions,  the SEC said in an Investor Alert in July.  These schemes often promise high returns for getting in on the ground floor of a growing Internet phenomenon. 
Rotunda had advice for investors.
 If you re investing in bitcoins or something tied to bitcoins or other digital currencies, do due diligence on the person promoting the investment,  he said.  Try to look at these things objectively, evaluate their own personal situation. An investment tied to digital currencies may be suitable for someone in their 20s, in their 30s. When you re talking about a retiree s nest egg, that may not be something they d want to subject to this type of a risk.

Bitcoin Q&A
What are bitcoins?
Bitcoin is a decentralized, completely digital currency that can be traded directly between two individuals, and is not regulated by governments or a central authority. Each bitcoin is a piece of computer code. There are currently 11 million bitcoins in existence, and additional bitcoins can be  mined  by solving complex mathematical algorithms. However, the anonymous creator of bitcoin set a cap on the number of coins that can be mined   21 million. This number is expected to be reached in the year 2140.
Aren't they used to buy drugs and evade taxes?
Bitcoins are traded directly, which means that users are not required to give identifying information to banks or regulators. Although a record of all bitcoin transactions does exist publicly, it does not have identifying information of individuals. This has given bitcoin a reputation as the cash of the Internet, and like cash, the currency is sometimes used for immoral or illegal purchases. However, it is also used to purchase everyday items like cars, food and clothes, and merchants can keep track of bitcoin transactions and pay taxes on them just as they would for cash transactions.
How can I get bitcoins?
You can  mine  them online, which involves complex computer coding and math. You can buy them directly using traditional currency (at an ATM or through an exchange). Or, you can trade with other people (for example, sell your car and get paid in bitcoin).
OK, but how do I actually use them?
Bitcoins are stored in an  electronic wallet  on a computer or smart phone. The currency can be bought using traditional currencies online. To make a purchase using bitcoin you can scan a QR code or use tap to pay (for in-person transactions) or use an online wallet to purchase goods on the Internet.
Where can I spend bitcoins?
Bitcoins can be spent nearly anywhere. Major retailors, including overstock.com, are increasingly accepting bitcoins, and websites such as gyft.com allow people to purchase giftcards to mainstream stores using the currency. They can also be traded directly between bitcoin users. In addition, local retailers and restaurants in the state are starting to accept bitcoins.
How much is a bitcoin worth?
There is a lot of fluctuation with bitcoin value. As of press time, one bitcoin was worth $649.30, according to preev.com. Each bitcoin can be divided up, currently up to 8 decimal points, allowing people to purchase items in increments smaller than full bitcoins. There are no official names for each division since no one is governing the currency.

Given how much Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has lost, both in terms of money and trust, it was only a matter of time before hackers struck back. Now such a group of enraged victims have hijacked Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles  own blog to reveal just how much the company really lost.
Mt. Gox s fall from grace is a matter of public knowledge, but the true extent of the damages incurred by the company is unsurprisingly kept behind closed doors. In fact, the entire company s strategy in dealing with its financial, and now legal, problems were supposed to be a secret until a  crisis strategy draft  document was leaked.
The document details the steps the company needs to take in order to appear less culpable, starting from inexplicably disappearing from the Internet, stepping down from the Bitcoin Foundation board, issuing a vague statement explaining the disappearance, and filing for bankruptcy, all of which took place the past weeks. Also notable in that document was the admission that Mt. Gox lost as much as 744,408 bitcoins due to a bug, amounting to around $340 million at that time. It seems, however, that the real, undisclosed figures are far worse.
Hackers dived into Mt. Gox s database not to steal bitcoins, or so the hackers said, but to get their hands on databases that will reveal the truth. With a hint of poetic justice, these same hackers used Karpeles  blog to post database dumps and other files that they were able to acquire. Among those is a list of the actual Bitcoin balances, which revealed the real number to be 951,116 bitcoins. That amount is a far cry from that in the leaked document as well as the numbers given by Mt. Gox itself when it filed for bankruptcy.
Karpeles s blog has been taken down now but, under the exhortation of the hackers, the data has been mirrored and made available elsewhere for others to see and review, including anonymized user accounts and their balances. Although the hackers claim that no user database dump has been made public, the incident demonstrates how Mt. Gox s security can be so easily compromised, which is how it ended up in trouble in the first place.

Mt Gox fielded MASSIVE DDOS attack before collapse
Report in Japan says '150,000 hits per second'
10 Mar 2014 at 00:57, Richard Chirgwin
A Japanese newspaper is reporting that during the spectacular collapse of the Mt Gox Bitcoin exchange, the operation's servers were also suffering a large-scale DDOS attack.
The Yomiuri Shimbun's English-language Japan News reports that the attacks in early February reached 150,000 DDOS hits per second,  mostly from servers in the United States and Europe .
Japan News notes that it doesn't require any special skill to launch a DDOS attack, citing Tetsutaro Uehara, a professor of information security at Ritsumeikan University:  DDoS attacks can be done without high-level hacking techniques. 
Referring to attacks on Slovenian Bitstamp and Canada's Flexcoin , Uehara said:  It is possible that copycats turned their eyes on other exchanges after weaknesses in Mt. Gox s system were found. 
By February 10, Mt Gox threw its hands up in the air and suspended Bitcoin withdrawals. It later emerged that attackers had found a way to exploit the Mt Gox code to steal 850,000 Bitcoins worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
Of the stolen Bitcoins, 750,000 belonged to customers and 100,000 were Mt Gox's own holdings.
Mt Gox is under investigation in the US and Japan.

Report: Mt. Gox was hit 150K times per second during DDoS attack before theft
Mt. Gox is a Bitcoin exchange that went bankrupt after getting hit by hackers last month. The hackers stole over $400 million worth of Bitcoin from Mt. Gox. How did they get in?
Apparently the hackers hit Mt. Gox with slightly under 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days before the Bitcoins were stolen.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection last month and was hit by the cyber-attacks around February 7th. according to the Yomiuri Shimbun. Hackers use multiple computers to send floods of requests to commit distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Mt. Gox s lawyers said that around 750,000 Bitcoins that belonged to customers of the service and another 100,000 of its own were stolen.
Bitcoin is created using chains of interactions among a large network of computers around the world. In the first two years of existence, Bitcoin was traded for cents on the dollar. It really started to climb in 2011 and jumped from $40 in late 2012 to $1,100 last year. It has now leveled to between $600 and $700 today.

Mt Gox collapse  shatters Bitcoin myth of virtual money
By Peter  Morici
web posted March 10, 2014
Bitcoin believers were shaken to their digital souls when  Mt. Gox, the world s largest exchange, defaulted on $470 million worth of deposits and closed.
The virtual currency was supposed to provide a safer, more  private and less costly alternative to money issued by governments, but lacking  the imprimatur of a sovereign is failing.
Fundamentally, money provides a secure place to keep your  wealth you can store your savings for later use at a government guaranteed  bank. And it eliminates the inconvenience of barter a necessity for even the  most rudimentary market economy.
Money permits a nightclub singer to buy bread from a baker  who gets his music from iTunes. All accept dollars, because the U.S. government  declares those to be  legal tender for all debts public and private. 
You can do business through barter or some alternative  currency. However, workers, suppliers and landlords expect to be paid in dollars,  and the IRS will require dollars at tax time for income earned through barter.
What gives money its value are the goods and services that  may be purchased and taxes paid within the sovereign jurisdiction of the  issuing government.
The earliest currencies were coins, often with the face of  the sovereign stamped on gold or silver to instill confidence. Yet, governments  minted coins with non-precious metals, and the Chinese issued paper money more  than two thousand years ago.
The creators of Bitcoin and advocates of virtual  currencies are fixated by the temptation of governments to print too much and  destroy its value through inflation.  However, inflation is hardly a  problem in the United States, Europe and Japan, and central banks in other countries  hold dollars, euro and yen to back up their currencies.
Bitcoin is created by ordinary folks solving increasingly  difficult mathematical problems defined by the virtual currency s creator, and  like gold, is naturally limited in supply. It is stored in virtual wallets on  private computers, or deposited at exchanges like Mt. Gox. These function much  like commercial banks but are not guaranteed for safety by the FDIC, Federal  Reserve and similar regulatory agencies around the world.
There is no  Bitland  where a government has declared it  legal tender to buy goods and services and pay taxes.  Lacking such a  tangible connection to the real economy, it is very hard to value day-to-day,  never mind next year.
Bitcoin traded for $1,117 on December 4, and now commands  only about half that amount.
It is no place for your children s college fund or  retirement savings.
Bitcoin is hardly secure. A hacker can steal it from your  digital wallet or an exchange that holds your deposits, just as pirates stole  bank debit and credit card numbers from Target. And the government does not  stand ready to back up Bitcoin exchanges that lose your money or identity to  thieves.
A 2013 study found some 45 percent of all Bitcoin  exchanges closed, taking their depositors money with them.
Bitcoin is supposed to be more private, because unlike  commercial banks, its exchanges are not monitored by regulators, and its  private payments system charges lower fees than do Visa and MasterCard.
However, personal and business transactions can be spied  by hackers or government security agencies through its fairly open payments  system. The government can subpoena your Bitcoin records or those of your  exchange when it needs.
Factoring in such risks and potential intrusions, Bitcoin  is a lot less private and more expensive to use than advertised.
Detractors of paper money have always been fixated by the  absence of gold to back it up, but they fail to recognize what really makes a  currency accepted and secure the government guarantee and the good sense of the  sovereign not to abuse its franchise. 
It s not the gold but the face of Caesar the promise his  image carries that makes a coin money.

BITCOIN exchange MtGox faced a massive hacker offensives last month, coming under 150,000 DDoS attacks a second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report says.
The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted losing half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since about February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reports.
While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.
Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.
The collapse of the exchange means around $500 million is missing.Source:AP
The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said on Sunday.
MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with about 100,000 units the company owned.
Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.
After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $US40 a coin in late 2012 and $US1100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.
Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.
US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.

Mt. Gox CEO's blog hacked; alleged Bitcoin balances posted
Hackers claim the data allegedly collected from the exchange's servers shows a disparity in the number of bitcoins deposited versus how many it claims were stolen in a security lapse.
@stevenmusil
A screenshot of the data purportedly taken by hackers from Mt. Gox servers.
Apparently frustrated by a lack of information about how Mt. Gox lost hundreds of millions of dollars in a security lapse, hackers hit the personal blog of Bitcoin exchange's chief executive to level charges of fraud.
The Reddit account and personal blog  of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, MagicalTux.net, were hijacked Sunday and defaced with a post that alleged the exchange kept some of the coins allegedly stolen in fraudulent withdrawals. Hackers also posted a 716MB Zip file that allegedly contained data stolen from Mt. Gox servers on the sites as well as to Pastebin .
The data dump claims that 951,116.21905382 bitcoins were deposited into Mt. Gox. The embattled exchange filed for bankruptcy last month, saying that Mt. Gox lost nearly 750,000 customer bitcoins, as well as 100,000 of the exchange's own bitcoins.
"First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles," hackers wrote. "It's time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed." The phrase "getting Goxed" has become synonymous with the frustration felt by many Mt. Gox investors, who have suffered frequent outages, delayed trading, and suspended withdrawals.

Following the MtGox Bitcoin exchange losing millions to a hack and filing for bankruptcy, anonymous attackers took over the personal blog and reddit account of MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles on Sunday. After seizing control, the hackers posted ( Pastebin ) a message to the two spaces detailing their findings and the reasoning behind the attack.

Having lost $468 million in bitcoins, MtGox files for bankruptcy protection
"It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities [sic] wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed," the message reads. "This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data... Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included."
Forbes reports the 716 megabyte file placed on Karpeles' site included items like his home address, CV, and an Excel spreadsheet that seems to document more than a million trades. But the most interesting piece of information shared is a summary of 18 different currency balances with 951,116 bitcoins listed. In light of the 850,000 bitcoins supposedly lost in the recent attack, the hackers concluded this figure demonstrates fraud. The footnote reads, "That fat fuck has been lying!!"
Despite the hack making noise around the Internet today, this leak is not yet guaranteed evidence of foul play. As Forbes notes, the balances could be a case of awful bookkeeping (it's not too far-fetched that MtGox was unaware of the hack for a while), and Karpeles has yet to return that site's request for comment.

A poster alerting customers that the digital currency Bitcoin is accepted as payment sits behind the counter inside a cafe in London. Bitcoin attracted media attention last week when Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, once the biggest exchange for the digital currency, filed for bankruptcy protection after coins valued at more than $500 million went missing.
ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
Washington Post
Future generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager's moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.
The past week was particularly extreme. The suicide of an American business executive in Singapore was investigated for possible ties to her Bitcoin investments. A California man fingered as the currency's mysterious inventor reacted to his sudden fame by asking that journalists buy him lunch. After finishing his meal at a sushi restaurant, he went on to deny any role whatsoever in Bitcoin.
Perhaps the most surprising development was that the virtual currency, despite wild fluctuations in value, continued to weather the mayhem. As the humans involved in the adventure looked increasingly vulnerable, Bitcoin looked comparatively solid, trading nearly 10 percent higher Saturday than a week before. Each bitcoin is worth more than $600 in recent trading.
"Bitcoin works really well," said Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer who is working to develop a different virtual currency. "All this craziness around Bitcoin isn't around Bitcoin itself. It's around the people."
Bitcoin, first issued in 2009, has gradually gained acceptance as a digital currency that, unlike dollars or euros, can move through the global trade system with low fees, relative privacy and no regulation. That has helped it flourish among technology enthusiasts and libertarians, as well as on marketplaces for illicit drugs and weapons.
"It's completely Wild West," said Garth Bruen, a security fellow at the Digital Citizens Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that combats online crime. "There are a lot of people getting rich, and there are a lot of people stealing."
Bitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that the currency has proved resistant to tampering. The total number in circulation can never go beyond a set amount, and each bitcoin is protected by a distinct cryptographic code. If that code is lost, as has sometimes happened, the bitcoin disappears forever.
But criminals have targeted the computers that store bitcoins in encrypted code, in depositories known as "hot wallets." Over the past two weeks, it has become clear they have succeeded spectacularly in breaking those systems.
The most famous example is Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy Feb. 28. It started as a site to trade cards for a popular game but shifted very profitably to Bitcoin, at one point becoming the biggest site for buying the virtual currency.
Mt. Gox relied on technology that experts consider easy to use but hard to secure against hackers. When the exchange declared bankruptcy, it reported having lost more $400 million from theft.
"The [Bitcoin] system and protocol itself was and is still sound," Dustin Trammell, a Bitcoin investor and security expert, said in an email exchange after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. "The currency exchange rate is holding stable during the fallout, and it really goes to articulate that Mt. Gox was simply a single bad actor, whether it be intentionally or just incompetence, in an otherwise solid fledgling financial industry."
Flexcoin, a Bitcoin bank based in Canada, followed with its own bankruptcy this past week, again reportedly because of losses to hackers. Criminals apparently relied on an old trick -- once popular against ATMs -- of trying to withdrawal money faster than a bank can rectify accounts, allowing what amounts to a double-dipping of available funds.
Hobbyists and speculators built the first generation of systems for storing and exchanging Bitcoin, despite having little of the expertise need to run financial institutions, Green said. "Look at it like somebody built a skyscraper out of wood," he said. "That's what happened."
Amid the bankruptcies, news reports said that the suicide of a 28-year-old American woman in Singapore may have been related to her job as chief executive of a company that traded virtual currencies, and to her personal investment in bitcoins.
The currency was created by a man who called himself Satoshi Nakamoto. Though the name was long thought to be a pseudonym, a Newsweek reporter found the California home of a Japanese American computer engineer who once went by that name before changing it several years ago.
Presented with evidence that he was the Bitcoin inventor, the man appeared to confirm the discovery in an article posted online Thursday. But he recanted -- after asking for lunch -- when a mob of journalists appeared at his home. Newsweek has said it is standing by its story, which included other evidence and interviews with several of the man's relatives.
Rising interest in Bitcoin has brought a flood of investments from venture capitalists, allowing for the development of exchanges that, experts say, are more likely to survive the attacks of hackers and other threats to the currency's stability. The number of merchants accepting bitcoins, meanwhile, has steadily grown, and several cities now have ATMs that trade in them, making exchanges easier.
Bitcoins are traded directly between individuals, without a bank to act as an intermediary. The transactions are recorded on a Web-based public ledger, called a "block chain," that provides a measure of transparency but also allows governments and others to potentially analyze transfers to determine who owns bitcoins and how they are being used. The exchanges are required by laws in the countries where they operate to record who buys bitcoins.
The block chain is scrutinized so carefully that it may be difficult for those who have stolen bitcoins to trade them without being discovered. Experts say it also would be impossible for Nakamoto, the inventor, to cash in any of his personal trove of bitcoins -- rumored to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- without finally and definitively revealing his identity.

Bitcoin s enthusiasts weather chaotic week
Sunday
Mar 9, 2014 at 1:35 AM Mar 9, 2014 at 3:05 AM
Future generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager s moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.
Future generations of Bitcoin billionaires may someday look back on 2014 with knowing smiles. Here was a year when thefts spread, exchanges collapsed, rates gyrated like a teenager s moods. And yet the buying of bitcoins showed no signs of abating.
The past week was particularly extreme. The suicide of an American business executive in Singapore was investigated for possible ties to her Bitcoin investments. A California man fingered as the currency s mysterious inventor reacted to his sudden fame by asking that journalists buy him lunch. After finishing his meal at a sushi restaurant, he went on to deny any role whatsoever in Bitcoin.
Perhaps the most surprising development was that the virtual currency, despite wild fluctuations in value, continued to weather the mayhem. As the humans involved in the adventure looked increasingly vulnerable, Bitcoin looked comparatively solid, trading nearly 10 percent higher Saturday than a week before. Each bitcoin is worth more than $600 in recent trading.
"Bitcoin works really well," said Matthew Green, a Johns Hopkins University cryptographer who is working to develop a different virtual currency. "All this craziness around Bitcoin isn t around Bitcoin itself. It s around the people."
Bitcoin, first issued in 2009, has gradually gained acceptance as a digital currency that, unlike dollars or euros, can move through the global trade system with low fees, relative privacy and no regulation. That has helped it flourish among technology enthusiasts and libertarians, as well as on marketplaces for illicit drugs and weapons.
"It s completely Wild West," said Garth Bruen, a security fellow at the Digital Citizens Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group that combats online crime. "There are a lot of people getting rich, and there are a lot of people stealing."
Bitcoin enthusiasts like to point out that the currency has proved resistant to tampering. The total number in circulation can never go beyond a set amount, and each bitcoin is protected by a distinct cryptographic code. If that code is lost, as has sometimes happened, the bitcoin disappears forever.
But criminals have targeted the computers that store bitcoins in encrypted code, in depositories known as "hot wallets." Over the past two weeks, it has become clear they have succeeded spectacularly in breaking those systems.
The most famous example is Mt. Gox, the Tokyo-based exchange that filed for bankruptcy Feb. 28. It started as a site to trade cards for a popular game but shifted very profitably to Bitcoin, at one point becoming the biggest site for buying the virtual currency.
Mt. Gox relied on technology that experts consider easy to use but hard to secure against hackers. When the exchange declared bankruptcy, it reported having lost more $400 million from theft.
"The (Bitcoin) system and protocol itself was and is still sound," Dustin Trammell, a Bitcoin investor and security expert, said in an email exchange after the Mt. Gox bankruptcy. "The currency exchange rate is holding stable during the fallout, and it really goes to articulate that Mt. Gox was simply a single bad actor, whether it be intentionally or just incompetence, in an otherwise solid fledgling financial industry."

Currency taking off bit by bit in the Northeast
Sunday
Mar 9, 2014 at 3:15 AM Mar 9, 2014 at 2:37 PM
Bitcoin, an up-and-coming form of online currency that falls outside of government and bank regulations, is becoming popular with the fairly libertarian New Hampshire population.
By KELLY BURCHnews@fosters.com
DOVER   New Hampshire residents love their freedom. It's right on their license plate:  Live Free or Die. 
Now bitcoin, an up-and-coming electronic currency, is giving people around the globe the chance to choose money that falls outside the government and bank regulations and New Hampshire residents are quickly picking up the new option.
 New Hampshire is fairly libertarian and also a very cosmopolitan state. A lot of tech companies are moving up here,  said Michael Finger, the owner of Centinel Consulting, a marketing and economic consulting firm in Portsmouth.  In a way, New Hampshire is a perfect area for bitcoin. 
For people who aren't part of the bitcoin movement, it can be hard to grasp initially. Bitcoin is an electronic, decentralized currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown developer. It allows patrons around the world to conduct financial transactions with no middleman, which keeps fees low, making it appealing to business owners. Users exchange bitcoins using apps on their phones or computers, and the money can be bought in online exchanges. Exchanges are tallied in a public register, but bitcoin can be used anonymously, which has given the currency a reputation for being used for nefarious purposes.
Governments are wary of bitcoin because of lack of control over the currency   there is no way to track bitcoin transactions to an individual or to regulate the currency. However, freedom from regulation is exactly what many bitcoin users find appealing.
 It allows people to be the master of their own fate, and to determine macroeconomic issues in a way that a centrally-control currency does not,  said Darren Tapp, from Chichester. Tapp has used bitcoin to buy everything from concert tickets to candy.
Matthew Carano is the owner of The P o Cafe in Newmarket, which was the first restaurant in New Hampshire to begin accepting bitcoin payments in the fall of 2012. He had heard of the currency a few years before, but didn't fully understand it until a friend explained the ins and outs.
 It can be a little bit daunting the first time you hear about it,  Carano said.  At first I got it, that it's a decentralized currency. Then I realized that it is also a fantastic payment processing system. From a business standpoint, it makes a lot of sense.  
Whereas traditional credit card transactions charge a fee of 3 to 4 percent and take a few days to complete, bitcoin transactions are virtually free and instantaneous. Carano was sold.
 It just shows that our banking system is not efficient any more for the needs of global commerce,  he said. The P o Caf  now hosts monthly bitcoin meet-ups, which draw a handful of new and experienced users to discuss everything from cyber security to new ways to use the currency. It is also a sponsor of The Bitcoin Symposium, taking place in Portsmouth on March 20. Carano said that at first he could go months without processing a bitcoin transaction, but now he sees them weekly.
 In general the technology is absolutely revolutionary,  he said.  I have a strong appreciation for bitcoin. 
Such a strong appreciation, in fact, that in addition to running the cafe, Carano also works for Lamassu, a Manchester-based company that has developed the first bitcoin ATMs. The machines, which are now being sold around the world, can accept traditional currency from over 200 countries and credit it to a user's electronic bitcoin wallet.
While bitcoin is by no means mainstream, it is garnering particularly strong interest in New Hampshire. When online retailer Overstock.com began accepting bitcoin payments in January of this year, New Hampshire had more bitcoin payments per resident than any other state. The currency is even appearing on the local political scene. In 2012, State Representative Mark Warden received bitcoin donations from about 20 supporters. He was the only candidate accepting the currency at the time, but said that he expects to see more candidates accepting bitcoin donations in this years' election cycle.
 A lot of young people are very tech savvy and libertarian minded, and they like the idea,  he said.  New Hampshire has a tradition of people who believe in the 'live free or die' spirit, and in competition and open markets in all things. 
About half of Warden's donations came from bitcoin users outside of New Hampshire who were happy to see the currency being used in a political campaign.
 They liked the mainstream credibility that comes with having a candidate accept the currency,  he said.
Many people who use bitcoin in New Hampshire are part of the Free State Project, a libertarian movement encouraging people from across the country to move to New Hampshire.
Amanda Billyrock, a blogger, moved to Manchester from Utah recently. She had heard of bitcoin before her move, but when she got to New Hampshire she said that she was delighted to see people using bitcoin for everyday expenses.
 Now I pay more bills in bitcoin than with federal reserve money,  she said.
Billyrock finds it reassuring that bitcoins are created at a set, steady rate. Eventually, there will be no new bitcoins created, so the currency will have no inflation, she said. On the other hand, the dollar's value fluctuates widely.
 The dollar and so many things that go along with it are really against what a lot of us in New Hampshire stand for   first and foremost, sound money,  she said.
Billyrock also values the security that she believes bitcoin provides.
 There is no such thing as fraud with bitcoin,  she said.  The only way someone can take your bitcoins is if they know your password, and there are a lot of resources within the crypto community for creating a really strong password. 
However, bitcoin's security has come under question recently as two major bitcoin institutions have reported theft. In late February, Mt. Gox, a Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange, reported a theft of 750,000 bitcoins, worth about $446 million. This week, Canadian bank Flexcoin reported a $600,000 heist.
Despite the news, local bitcoin enthusiasts remain committed to the currency.
 Mt. Gox was a terrible bank,  said Carano.  Most people in the community knew they were a terrible bank for a long time. It's important to know that this is an issue with a bad company, not with the bitcoin network. It's a good thing that it came out. 
Carano said that by storing bitcoin safely in a private wallet online, the currency is perfectly safe to use.
Although Billyrock does half of her spending with bitcoin, she has never used an exchange. She noted, like Carano, that the recent problems have to do with exchanges themselves, not with bitcoin technology.
 We would see banks that hold the US dollar fail left and right, but they always get bailed out,  she said.  Businesses come and go in the market. It's natural and healthy. 
A key difference is that dollar deposits are protected by the FDIC. Because bitcoin is not regulated by governments, there are no legal protections for bitcoin users.
Japan may be one of the first countries to change that. The nation is considering adopting guidelines around bitcoin, in wake of the failure of Mt. Gox. The proposed legislation would set up protocols for taxing bitcoin transactions, and would ban banks and security firms from handling the coins   treating bitcoin like a commodity rather than a currency.
Despite the risks, local bitcoin users said they would not like to see bitcoin regulated in the United States.
 It would be unfortunate if government feels the need to clamp down or restrict this,  said Representative Warren.  Bitcoin is cutting edge technology and is way more advanced than most legislators can understand. They will just mess it up.

Inside Mt Gox
Written by Muhammad Zulqarnain Zulfi | New Delhi | Updated: Mar 9 2014, 17:43pm hrs
The collapse of Mt Gox, the Japanese bitcoin exchange that?s one of the first, is almost unbelievable. (AP)
The collapse of Mt Gox, the Japanese bitcoin exchange thats one of the first, is almost unbelievable. Close to half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins have gone missing, prompting Mt Gox to file for bankruptcy protection in Japan recently
What is Mt Gox
Mt Gox began as a market for trading cards used in the fantasy game Magic: The Gathering, but diversified in 2010 into an exchange for bitcoin, a little-known virtual currency launched a year earlier. Run by Frenchman Mark Karpeles, it became the dominant bitcoin exchange and at one point handled around 80 per cent of the world's bitcoin trade.
Why did Mt Gox file for bankruptcy
Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in Tokyo District Court on February 28, saying it couldnt account for 750,000 of its customers bitcoins and 100,000 of its own, roughly worth $474 million. The company also cant account for $27.3 million in cash customer deposits.
The problem
A document circulating on the Internet that claims to have been prepared on behalf of Mt. Gox blamed the problem on a malleability-related theft which went unnoticed for several years. The document also says that the offline cold storage, where the bitcoins private keys or code are stored, has been wiped out due to a leak in the hot wallet (the online part)". A Reuters report says that this suggests the vast majority of Mt. Goxs bitcoin deposits were leaking out without anyone noticing.
The collapse
Mt Gox long had problems processing international transfers for people who wanted to cash out. On February 7, it halted withdrawals while investigating a security flaw regarding transaction malleability, an application which allows transaction IDs to be renamed.
Can the missing bitcoins be traced
Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain. But due to a lack of custom software tools to analyse the blockchain, tracing transactions is hard.
Will depositors get their money back
one class-action suit has been filed in the US and another planned in the UK. Mt Gox said that they need to investigate a huge amount of transaction reports in order to establish the truth. But these investigations could take a long time, and international lawsuits are unlikely to proceed quickly.
What does this mean for the future of bitcoins
Mt Goxs viability has long been questioned by users. But the bitcoin community, stung by past thefts and frauds, is largely looking forward, saying it will have little impact on the long-term prospects for the virtual currency. The price of bitcoin has been relatively stable amid the collapse and is now around $660. The total market capitalisation of all bitcoins is roughly $8.3 billion.
Bitcoin and India
* The exchange was predominantly used by foreigners, including those representing clients. In its bankruptcy filing, Mt Gox has listed 1.27 lakh creditors, of which only 1,000 are from Japan.
* The incident could intensify calls for stricter regulatory checks on bitcoins and other virtual
currencies in India and other countries.
* A PTI report says most of the affected Indians refused to identify themselves, fearing probing questions from tax and other authorities in India as they mostly used un-taxed money to purchase bitcoins.
* However, many bitcoin operators and traders confirmed that a majority of bitcoins held by Indians were being traded on Mt Gox.

Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced 150,000 attacks per second - report
  Flickr.com/btckeychain/cc-by
Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said Sunday.
The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming its sources.
Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.
The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins were stolen, the Yomiuri said.
MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that the company owned.
Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.
After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $610 level.
Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.
US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.
Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.

UK s first bitcoin machine opens in east London cafe
Offering customers the ability to exchange bank notes for bitcoins.
Reuters  /  9 March 2014&nbsp03:21
Britain s first machine for dispensing digital currency opened for business in a cafe near London s  Silicon roundabout  tech hub in east London on Friday, offering customers the ability to exchange bank notes for bitcoins.
Nick Letchford, managing director of the group that owns the Old Shoreditch Station cafe, decided to install the machine after noticing the popularity of bitcoins among his customers working nearby in the digital industries.
 It gets used regularly based on where we are located,  he said.  There are lots of technology-orientated consumers within our area, and it caters very easily for them,  he said.
 Currently people are buying coffees and beers with bitcoins, mostly beers actually,  Letchford added.
He sees a mainstream future for the virtual currency, even though the top bitcoin exchange has collapsed and the currency has been volatile due to speculation as well as prone to criminal activities.
At the beginning of March, the Tokyo-based company Mt. Gox, once the world s biggest bitcoin exchange, declared bankruptcy saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.
In 2012, a leaked FBI report said the virtual currency was an  increasingly useful tool for various illegal activities beyond the cyber realm .
Bitcoin, which has been growing in popularity, relies on a network of computers that solve complex mathematical problems as part of a process that verifies and permanently records the details of every bitcoin transaction.
The currency came into existence in 2009, with the value negotiated by individuals chatting on bitcoin forums. The whistle-blowing site Wikileaks and other organisations began to accept the currency for donations, and by the end of 2012 some 1,000 organisations had followed suit.
Customers who use the machine in East London are charged an 8 percent commission, and each customer is limited to 1,000 pounds ($1,700) in transactions per month.
 I think it is very much a burgeoning thing,  Letchford said. It s not mainstream in any way, but I think from a vendor s perspective it is so straightforward and simple. There is a future in it as it becomes embraced by the mainstream.

Trouble with bitcoins
Fewer than 1 per cent of Mt.Gox s 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.
 It s not money," said Finance Minister
Taro Aso
.  Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?" he asked at a regular news conference.  Opinions are divided."
The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.
But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.
Regarding money laundering, certain transactions   whether with bitcoin or not   require people to identify themselves, it notes.
The six-page document is the government s official response to questions posed by
Tsutomu Okubo
, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.

jdlasica/flickrMarc Andreessen is bullish on Bitcoin.
It's been a tough couple of weeks for Bitcoin.
Hackers have had their way with three Bitcoin sites that hold customer funds, and one, for all intents and purposes, has gone out of business. Poloniex had $50,000 of Bitcoin stolen; Flexcoin reported $600,000 in theft ; and Mt. Gox -- the first and at one time, the largest exchange -- reportedly had $400 million stolen, which caused it to cease business and declare bankruptcy. This turmoil has sent the former golden child of hipster investors plummeting from the nosebleed heights of $1,242 per coin to a low of $419.
The virtual currency gods then poured salt into the wound when the Japanese government announced that it intended to regulate Bitcoin -- a move that foreshadows similar actions by regulators in North America and the European Union. The dark cloud hanging over the currency got a bit darker -- reminding us that though the currency is virtual, the people behind it are real -- when it was announced that Autumn Radtke, CEO of bitcoin exchange First Meta, committed suicide at the age of 28.
So why hasn't Bitcoin failed once and for all? The answer doesn't have to do so much with what is happening now with the currency as it does with who is betting big on its success.
Follow the Leaders: Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson
Allow me to introduce you to two people who think Bitcoin is just in its infancy, and whose opinions you should pay attention to: Marc Andreessen and Fred Wilson.
You might recognize Andreessen as the co-creator of the first web browser -- Mosaic -- and co-founder of Netscape Communications, which was purchased by AOL ( AOL ) (publisher of DailyFinance) in 1999 for $4.2 billion. After that, he went on to form Andreessen Horowitz, one of the premier Silicon Valley venture capital firms, which was an early investor in such obscure start-ups as Facebook ( FB ), Twitter ( TWTR ), Groupon ( GRPN ) and Zynga ( ZNGA ).
You might not recognize Fred Wilson, but his support of bitcoin may be even more prescient. Wilson is an outlier in the VC world, shunning the West Coast and headquartering in New York City. Even odder in the world of angel investors, where secrecy is the name of the game, Wilson writes a popular and widely read blog, AVC .
Wilson, too, has an uncanny knack of getting in on the ground floor of tech companies before they become household names. Through his company, Union Square Ventures, he and his partners have invested in Zynga, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Twitter, Foursquare, Etsy and a little company called Coinbase.
A Virtual Wallet Could Be the Killer App
Coinbase provides a virtual wallet for you to carry your Bitcoins and offers a platform where merchants and consumers can transact business in the new digital currency. And if that just made a little bell in your head go off, you might be thinking the same thing I am.
I don't claim to be an expert in Bitcoin. Nor do I know what trajectory will take Bitcoin out of its current troubles and into the hearts, minds and pocketbooks of every citizen of the world. But I do know that when very smart people put their money where their mouths are, we should all pay attention.
%VIRTUAL-article-sponsoredlinks%Andreessen, whose company has invested millions in Bitcoin-related businesses, equates the recent problems with similar transitory events in futures and commodities. "This is like MF Global, not some huge breakdown of the underlying technology or other exchanges," he told CNBC. "Bitcoin protocol is unchanged, and other exchanges and companies are doing fine."
Wilson went further, announcing on his blog that he personally bought more Bitcoins on the day Mt. Gox went out of business.
Technology moves so fast these days that those of us who don't live, breath and drink it on a daily basis often can't see the virtual forest for the trees. So before you dismiss Bitcoin as a fad or a case of technology run amok, take a minute to see who is championing it and what their track record is in successfully envisioning the future.
No man is an island, or even a peninsula, so I encourage your feedback in the comments below. And don't forget to pick up my book, " Trading: The Best of the Best -- Top Trading Tips for Our Time ."

You can even buy a ticket to space on the Virgin Galactic using Bitcoins (File Photo)
BLink compiles everything you wanted to know about this cryptocurrency, but were too tech-shy to ask
Some say that it s going to revolutionise the global monetary system, while others argue that it s nothing but another clever cyber-ponzi scheme. Whatever it is, Bitcoins have changed the way the world perceives currency online and off it.
In the news for the wrong reasons of late   with the bankruptcy of one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Mt Gox, last week   the cryptocurrency made a quick recovery, however.  Bitcoin has shrugged off Mt Gox s death rattle  reported Forbes.com, even as the exchange rate to the dollar continued to be an eye-popping $550 (approx.) a Bitcoin.
Already a common fixture in online trade, the Bitcoin s success story may not be over yet. So as long as you don t throw away your digital currency in the bin   like James Howells of Wales, who while cleaning up his table, threw away a hard drive containing a digital wallet with 7,500 Bitcoins (worth over $7.5 million)   you might still end up cashing in on the  Bitcoin revolution .
What is a Bitcoin?
On November 1, 2008 a research paper was posted by one Satoshi Nakamoto on an obscure cryptographic listserv titled  Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System . Traditionally, the origins of Bitcoins are traced back to this paper. Nakamoto (an alias, the original identity of the person is as yet unknown) proposed the creation of digital money that is convenient and untraceable, liberated from the oversight of governments and banks. One that could avoid all the usual problems that arise when making online payments.
The basic premise underpinning Bitcoin s potential success is that because it is decentralised and not issued by any government, in theory, it is free from interference and manipulation, unlike the world s tangible fiat currencies. In several ways however, it works in the same way as paper money. Bitcoins are also available in a physical form in some cases. But its primary form continues to be data; you can use it to buy things online, peer to peer, using wallet softwares or an online service.
Where does it come from?
Bitcoins are created or  mined  as a result of complex number crunching by a network of computers. This process currently creates 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes. A predetermined upper limit of 21 million is expected to be reached in the year 2140. After that the total number of Bitcoins will stay unchanged.
There are two ways to get your hands on Bitcoins. The easy way is to purchase them by signing up for online  Wallet  services   Mywallet and Coinbase are among the more popular sites at the moment. Once you have signed up and linked it to one of your existing bank accounts, you can buy or sell Bitcoins as you please.
The hard way is to  mine  Bitcoins. This is similar to mining for gold. But here you re scouring the web for 64-digit numbers. By getting your computer to solve puzzles constantly, you can compete with other miners to generate the number that the Bitcoin network is on the lookout for. If your computer generates it, you receive 25 Bitcoins. This is a tall order though, and miners often do this in groups, sharing the spoils between themselves. While this might reduce their individual yields, at least it ensures some sort of return for the time and effort they invest.
Satoshi Nakomoto had mined the first block of Bitcoins or  genesis block , with a reward of 50 bitcoins. Negotiations to fix the value of the first few transactions were done on Bitcoin forums; notable among them was the trade of a pizza for 10,000 BTC or Bitcoins.
What is it used for?
A Bitcoin can be used for many purposes but its most important use continues to be the buying and selling of it. Much like traditional stock dealers, the idea is to buy low and sell high to reap maximum returns. Other uses   legal and illegal   exist all over the internet. Bitcoinmagazine.com lists many options in various price categories where the mined or bought Bitcoin can be spent   anything from paying for online dating (okcupid.com) to buying a house.
Gregory Simon, an American Banker, for instance, quit his job and decided to shift to Nicaragua. He used Bitcoins to pay for 0.3 acre of land in the new country. Houses at the Hamptons near New York and the Alberta Province in Canada can also be bought now using Bitcoins. Even Richard Branson of the Virgin Group has decided to give customers a chance to buy a seat on the Virgin Galactic using Bitcoins!
Why should you care?
With e-tailing becoming the preferred way of shopping and selling, regardless of whether you re a business analyst or just someone looking to pick up a pair of headphones, it is good to keep with the trend, currency-wise too. Besides, the anonymity of the Bitcoin service   which is what makes it scary for many   can work in your favour too.
What are the risks?
Barely six years old, Bitcoin is not without its risks and is very much a work-in-progress. As the Mt Gox fiasco highlighted, a Bitcoin user could lose a lot of money due to events that are not under his control as well. Mt Gox, created in 2011 as a Bitcoin exchange, grew to handle over 70 per cent of the world s Bitcoin trades by April 2013.
On February 7, 2014, all withdrawals were halted by Mt Gox. The company issued a statement saying,  A bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of Bitcoins to a Bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur.  It was all downhill from there. The company finally filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo on February 28, and reported that they had lost almost 750,000 of its customers  Bitcoins and about 100,000 of its own. It added up to about seven per cent of all existing Bitcoins and was worth around $473 million. In a follow-up statement, Mt Gox said,  The company believes there is a high possibility that the Bitcoins were stolen. 
With the increasing popularity of Bitcoins, many phishing and malware setups specifically targeting Bitcoin users are coming up as well. A DellSecureWorks report estimates that there are at least 150 kinds of malware designed specifically to steal Bitcoins.
What does the future hold?
With many countries and corporations now willing to accept Bitcoins, the currency s future looks strong. The Indian situation is still unclear though. The Reserve Bank of India issued an advisory against the use of virtual currency and stated that it doesn t have any plans of regulating Bitcoin usage. Currently there are over 2,000 active Indian users of Bitcoins, but with the third largest number of internet users in the world (150 million), the number of Bitcoin users too is expected to shoot up.
No one can argue against another apocalyptic online event that takes the whole thing down. At the same time, the precise engineering of the Bitcoin system, its finiteness and anonymous setup, gives it an edge over traditional currencies and other attempted digital currencies as well.
Even if the Bitcoin experiment fails, the technological innovations   such as the Bitmessage client, which allows users to receive and send e-mails anonymously   it has helped foster, are sure to carry the legacy of this cryptocurrency forward.

Japan says Bitcoin not a currency, but taxable
08 march 2014, 12:00

Bitcoin is not a currency but transactions involving it should be "subject to taxation", Japan's government said Friday, in a move that could pave the way for formal regulations on the troubled virtual unit, AFP reports.
Tokyo also said that banks could not broker Bitcoin transactions or open accounts holding the virtual unit, which launched just five years ago, in an apparent bid to clamp down on the digital currency.
But, as regulators around the world grapple with how to handle Bitcoin, the Japanese statement did not specify if Tokyo would immediately begin cracking down on it, or how it would do so, given the unit's opaque nature.
Bitcoin "does not fall under the category of a currency" as defined by Japanese law, the government statement said, echoing the views of central banks in other countries.
And "generally speaking it is subject to taxation if it meets conditions laid out in income tax law, corporate tax law and sales tax law, among others", the statement added.
If Bitcoin transactions were used for money laundering "that would constitute a crime", it said, adding that "there are no Japanese laws that clearly define Bitcoin".
"As a matter of common sense, if there are transactions and subsequent gains, it is natural... for the finance ministry to consider how it can impose taxes," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Friday.
Asked whether Japan would become a global leader on regulating Bitcoin, Suga said: "We are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do."
Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.
Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime or terrorism.
Last week, the spectacular failure of the Japan-based MtGox trading exchange set off alarm bells over Bitcoin, which backers have promoted as a low-cost alternative to fiat currencies such as the US dollar or Japanese yen.
US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.
Yellen has said US regulators, including the Treasury, are watching the Bitcoin sector for potential money laundering and other criminal uses of the digital currency.
MtGox, which at one time reportedly processed 80 percent of global Bitcoin transactions, last week sought bankruptcy protection and admitted that it lost half a billion dollars worth of the digital currency.
Suga said Friday that Japanese officials were closely monitoring MtGox's bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and why the exchange imploded.
This week, an alleged theft of $600,000 worth of the currency by hackers forced a Canada-based online business serving Bitcoin traders and investors to shut down.
In more misfortune linked with the troubled currency, Singapore police on Thursday said they were investigating the "unnatural"death of a 28-year-old American boss of a Bitcoin exchange.
Autumn Radtke, chief executive of Singapore-based First Meta, was found dead on February 26, but no foul play was suspected, police said.
Also on Thursday, Newsweek claimed it had found the true identity of the mysterious person or group behind the Bitcoin revolution -- "Satoshi Nakamoto", a 64-year-old, Japanese-American physicist and model train enthusiast.
Nakamoto has denied being involved in Bitcoin.
The Bitcoin Foundation, which supports the development of the currency, would not confirm Newsweek's story.
After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off to the current $650 level.

Bitcoins being used in Southwest Florida businesses
Posted:
Updated:
SOUTHWEST FLORIDA -
Some say it's the money of the future, and it's starting to pop up around Southwest Florida.
We're talking about Bitcoin   a digital currency that can be used all around the world.
In a smart phone world, it's a way to purchase goods in an instant.
"Bitcoin allows you to be your own banker," said Butterfly Estates owner Rob Johnson.
You can use Bitcoin to buy real stuff without financial establishments.  But there's no Federal Reserve to back you up if it fails.
"Right now, we really don't know how much the government is printing in money every single day.  They can print as much money as they want, and you and I have no idea what that amount is," said Johnson.
With Bitcoin, only $21 million will ever be made.  It's a concept that's starting to gain tractions.
"I know it's on-line, but I don't know much else about it.  I didn't know it was in Fort Myers," said Fort Myers resident Sandy Toney.
Johnson uses Bitcoin at the Butterfly Estates and ZCrepes Caf .  He's one of about a dozen Southwest Florida businesses that accept Bitcoin as payment.
"Using it at my restaurant for instance is a great benefit for me because I'm a business owner   but I don't have to pay some of the surcharges that you have to pay with credit cards," said Johnson.
If you wanted to pay for a crepe with Bitcoin, all you have to do is open up the app on your phone, enter the amount in U.S. dollar amount and it automatically converts it into Bitcoin money.  Once you open up the QR code, scan it and your bill is paid.
"The problem is that you look at what the price of Bitcoin has done since it was first introduce and it has been very volatile," said Wells Fargo financial advisor Nick Chlumsky.
Right now, one Bitcoin is worth about $630.  One year ago, it was as low as $50.
But that's not the only issue.
"There's a lot of implications for not only how you track the currency and how local governments and municipalities can collect taxes on the expenditures that are being made with Bitcoin," said Chlumsky.
So, how do you get them?
You can buy the Bitcoins on-line or use specialized computers and software to "mine" for it.  Mining involves the computer solving puzzles to earn currency that already exists from collected transactions fees and newly minted Bitcoins.
"I really believe this is the money of the future," said Johnson.

A week after the collapse of Mt. Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.
In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered - or more often, not covered - by existing law.
The issue took on new prominence in Japan on Feb. 28, when Mt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.
Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank, "we have not grasped the situation in its entirety."
The authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
Fewer than 1 percent of Mt. Gox's 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.
"It's not money," said Finance Minister Taro Aso. "Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?" he asked at a regular news conference. "Opinions are divided."
The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.
But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.
Regarding money laundering, certain transactions - whether with bitcoin or not - require people to identify themselves, it notes.
The 6-page document is the government's official response to questions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.

Imagining Bitcoin s Future: Privacy or Regulation?
March 5, 2014
By Bennett Voyles
Bitcoin has spurred interest in virtual currencies, which have the ability to revolutionize our world. But governments and regulators will have the last word on bitcoin s future prospects.
After a year of wild price swings from $13.50 per coin in January 2013 to $1,242 in November and now back to around $500 and the recent closure of Mt. Gox in Japan, until recently bitcoin s largest exchange, the bitcoin currency system looks far too volatile to become a universal currency any time soon. However, some economists and venture capitalists believe that a digital monetary system has enough practical advantages that sooner or later, your money may be even more virtual than it is now. What is the future of bitcoin?
Invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym of an unknown cryptographer, bitcoin is an ingenious peer-to-peer payment system that enables people to make transactions without any recourse to a government-issued currency.
But like the ones and zeros that make up the binary language of the digital world, the views of what that future might look like tend to run toward extremes. On the con side, science fiction writer and economic blogger Charles Stross imagines that a bitcoin economy would starve government services by reducing government s ability to tax, make it easier to trade all kinds of illegal things, and in the end, make  a sub-Saharan kleptocracy look like a socialist utopia .
Bitcoin boosters, on the other hand, see it as a key technology in building a more prosperous world in which capital moves with less friction, individuals are completely free to make their own economic choices, and money is no longer a government monopoly. As one bitcoin site puts it,  No individual or organization can control or manipulate the Bitcoin protocol because it is cryptographically secure. This allows the core of Bitcoin to be trusted for being completely neutral, transparent and predictable. 
Bitcoin Pluses and Minuses
If the advantages and the disadvantages sound quite similar, that s no accident. Many of bitcoin s most committed supporters have a Libertarian bent, and argue that apart from a few limited functions, the world could be run better if people were left largely to their own devices.
A world dominated by a digital, non-state currency, would be  a world of strong privacy,  says David D. Friedman, a law professor at Santa Clara University in California and son of the late free market economist Milton Friedman.
Strong privacy would share many of the characteristics of the old Swiss bank system that enabled people to hold assets anonymously a good thing say, if you re trying to escape from the Nazis, but not so good if you re a citizen in a developing country trying to find your country s vanished oil revenues.
Taxation would be more difficult in a world of strong privacy.  It s really hard to tax something you can t see,  Friedman says. It would also be a lot more difficult to watch what people are doing.
One possible preview of the dark side of that future came in November, when the US Justice Department disclosed the arrest of Ross William Ulbricht , the alleged founder of Silk Road, a kind of underworld eBay, in San Francisco. Prosecutors allege that the secret website had made it possible for people to buy and sell drugs, arms, and a variety of illicit services, all with bitcoins.
It would also make it more difficult for governments to clamp down on organizations for ideological reasons. Eli Dourado, a research fellow at the technology policy program of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, says a virtual currency would also make it a lot harder for governments stop organizations they don t like.  Wikileaks, for instance, was starved of funds because the US government made it impossible for people to donate money to the controversial group.
Bitcoin could lead to considerable disruption in the financial world as well. For example, bitcoin could be a boon for migrant workers, who now must spend a considerable part of their income simply sending their hard-earned money home. Migrant workers send more than $500 billion home a year, according to World Bank figures, and currently pay high fees on those remittances: a 2010 United Nations report noted that they pay as much as $18 on a $200 transfer by Western Union or the other two leading operators.
However, as radical as some of these changes might sound, Dourado argues that people have overlooked even more revolutionary implications of bitcoin.  I think bitcoin is actually a kind of base-layer protocol in the same way that TCP/IP is for the internet,  he says.
 Bitcoin is programmable money,  Dourado explains. As a ledger-based system, a bitcoin could be attached to some real property. For example, a single bitcoin might be tied to a title deed, making it possible to buy a car without ever meeting the seller.  Or it might be programmed to perform an if-then statement, he says, making it possible to create Kickstarter-like but entirely decentralized markets.
Dourado s view isn t unique. Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape, has argued in the New York Times that bitcoin is at a similar stage of development to the personal computer in 1975 or the internet in 1993, and represents  a sweeping vista of opportunity .
Andreessen and number of other Silicon Valley venture capitalists are already trying to stake claims in that sweeping vista. In 2013, venture capitalists invested $74 million in 40 bitcoin-related ventures , $50 million of that in the fourth quarter, according to CB Insights, a venture capital data analytics firm.
Bigger players may be trying to get in on this virtual gold rush as well. In December, eBay filed a patent application for something that sounds a lot like electronic money and could be sent by one person to another,  a Gift Token  that can be limited to use at a specified store, a specified group of stores, or a specified chain of stores. The token can be limited to use in purchasing a specified product.  Tokens could also be limited geographically, according to the application, to a particular city or region.
Not-so-Brave New World
But whether bitcoin itself is part of that digital monetary future remains to be seen. Enough legal problems have already cropped up that the new currency could end up being the Napster of digital money the pioneer that paves the way for a more government-friendly alternative. It has been especially difficult for bitcoin in China . 
Government officials in Europe and elsewhere won t sit back forever if the use of digital money grows, predicts Robert Pargac, Director of Global Investigations and Compliance for Navigant Consulting in New York. Should the value of bitcoins remain volatile, regulators could ultimately classify them as a type of commodity, he says.
 If [bitcoin proponents] really want a secretive, anonymous, free-floating market-driven virtual currency that s not regulated, that s simply not going to happen,  says Pargac.  It s not going to be good for the consumer, it won t be good for the economy and regulators and law enforcement will not permit it. They will find it and they will close it down.

Japan says Bitcoin's not currency, but taxable

TOKYO--Bitcoin is not a currency but transactions involving it should be "subject to taxation," Japan's government said Friday, in a move that could pave the way for formal regulations on the troubled virtual unit.
Tokyo also said that banks could not broker Bitcoin transactions or open accounts holding the virtual unit, which launched just five years ago, in an apparent bid to clamp down on the digital currency.
But, as regulators around the world grapple with how to handle Bitcoin, the Japanese statement did not specify if Tokyo would immediately begin cracking down on it, or how it would do so, given the unit's opaque nature.
Bitcoin "does not fall under the category of a currency" as defined by Japanese law, the government statement said, echoing the views of central banks in other countries.
And "generally speaking it is subject to taxation if it meets conditions laid out in income tax law, corporate tax law and sales tax law, among others," the statement added.
If Bitcoin transactions were used for money laundering "that would constitute a crime," it said, adding that "there are no Japanese laws that clearly define Bitcoin."
"As a matter of common sense, if there are transactions and subsequent gains, it is natural ... for the finance ministry to consider how it can impose taxes," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters Friday.
Asked whether Japan would become a global leader on regulating Bitcoin, Suga said: "We are now sorting things out under the current law and mulling what the government can do."
Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network of computers around the planet.

Big banks jumping on bitcoin bandwagon
March 7, 2014, 1:21 PM ET

Many major Wall Street banks are trying to understand bitcoin, the virtual currency that has gained interest in the last few years, and how it could change the global payment system, say industry experts.
Bloomberg
A twenty-five bitcoin
\ What we have learned is that many of the banks have individuals and teams now focused on getting to know bitcoin and how it impacts the business,  said Barry Silbert, founder and CEO of SecondMarket, which is working on creating a U.S.-based bitcoin exchange and is an investor in Bitcoin companies.
Silbert was speaking at a panel discussion at the MarketWatch Investing Insights event  Bitcoin: Boom and Bust  late Tuesday in New York.
Banks are trying to understand what a digital-currency world looks like from an infrastructure perspective, said Silbert.
Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency that has been trumpeted as a faster and cheaper alternative to existing payments systems and has attracted the interest of high-profile venture capitalists. Some even say it has the potential to be a widely used currency. But it isn\ t regulated and a prominent bitcoin exchange shut down last month after hackers stole all its customers\  bitcoins, leaving users with little recourse and raising concerns about security.
On Friday, Japan\ s government said bitcoin isn\ t a currency or a financial product and will be treated like other goods and services. Prices of bitcoin, meanwhile, have swung from $13 in early 2013 to above $1,000 in November and back down to around $625 on Friday.
So far, Bank of America Corp.
, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
and Wells Fargo & Co.
 have published reports on bitcoin for clients. Morgan Stanley has not.
J.P. Morgan analyst John Normand writes: \ For corporates, bitcoin s appeal is two-fold: no or low transaction costs from a peer-to-peer payments system, and potential brand recognition from trialing an innovative technology.\ 
Bank of America analysts say bitcoin may emerge as a serious competitor to traditional money-transfer providers.   As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin has clear potential for growth, in our view,  they add.
Wells Fargo hosted a panel on virtual currency in January that looked at bitcoin\ s viability, compliance and future. Goldman Sachs included a panel on digital currency as part of a global macro conference on Thursday.
 If payments or transactions can be done cheaper, there is an incentive for entrepreneurs and financial firms to get involved,  said Steven Englander, Citigroup\ s global head of G10 FX strategy.
Financial firms have showed interest in key areas such as whether bitcoin is an investment opportunity, a commodity to be traded or a currency to be converted for clients.
A number of commodities and currency traders are digging into bitcoin and using their own money to to trade bitcoin, noted Silbert. And banks are also interested in the virtual currency, as exchanges are being to formed, to provide potential services to clients such as converting bitcoin into other currencies.
\ Bitcoin s primary attraction, in my view, is that it is a way to transfer funds instantaneously and cheaply with a pretty secure system,\  said Englander.
Several high-profile business leaders have showed interest in bitcoin in recent months, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Nobel laureate economist Robert Shiller, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, former vice president Al Gore and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen , note industry enthusiasts, which is encouraging for the industry.
These are the early stages for banks getting involved in bitcoin, and the industry as a whole is hesitant in getting involved before regulators weigh in, says Silbert, the Secondmarket founder.
\ Banks are waiting for clearer guidance at the federal level on how businesses are having interactions with bitcoin and there is still some questions on the state level,\  he added.

The Japanese government has come down hard on the digital currency bitcoin.
The government today ruled that bitcoin does not fall under the category of currency as defined by the country s law and that the transactions involving it should be made  taxable .
Further it warned Japanese banks from opening accounts holding the virtual currency. Tokyo also clarified that banks are not allowed to broker bitcoin transactions.
According to the government, if bitcoins are used for money laundering, it would be classified under crime. The government is in an attempt to bring bitcoin transactions under the tax radar. The crypto currency is subject to taxation if it satisfies any clauses of income tax law, sales tax laws or any other prevailing laws in the country.
The government also warned users against owning and trading bitcoins. Citing the recent collapse of MtGox bitcoin exchange, the government also alerted users on chances of losing bitcoins through abuse of bitcoin system. The misunderstanding of how it works and the lack of regulations make it risky. Japan has now joined other countries in the world to caution the users about the potential financial and security related risks that they may be exposed to. It also warned that bitcoins could also be used for illegal activities, money laundering and for various unintentional  violation of laws.
However, the Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga declined to comment on the time frame for implementation of the proposed regulations.

A week after Mt Gox collapse, Japan struggles to understand bitcoin

Mark Karpeles, chief executive officer of Mt Gox (centre) attends a news  conference at the Tokyo District Court. The world s largest Bitcoin  exchange filed for bankruptcy in Japan, focusing attention on the  digital currency s risks.
Reuters/Tokyo
A week after the collapse of Mt. Gox, Japan is still struggling to craft a response to the bitcoin phenomenon, saying the crypto-currency is not legal tender, though it might be taxable and subject to money-laundering controls.
In its first detailed response to the bankruptcy of the Tokyo-based company, once the world s biggest bitcoin exchange, the government issued a statement assessing how bitcoin is covered   or more often, not covered   by existing law.
The issue took on new prominence in Japan on February 28, when Mt. Gox sought Chapter 11-style bankruptcy protection, saying it had lost bitcoins and cash worth some half a billion dollars due to hacker attacks.
Bitcoin is not a currency, but could be taxable under some circumstances, the statement says. Although the government understands that bitcoin is not issued or backed by any government or central bank,  we have not grasped the situation in its entirety. 
The authorities are monitoring the Mt. Gox bankruptcy process and, if necessary, will consider a response, said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga.
Fewer than 1% of Mt. Gox s 127,000 creditors are Japanese, the company has said. Yet across the government, officials are wrestling with how to handle bitcoin.
 It s not money,  said finance minister Taro Aso.  Does the Financial Services Agency have jurisdiction? The Finance Ministry? The Consumer Affairs Agency? The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry?  he asked at a regular news conference.  Opinions are divided. 
The government statement, citing 18 sections of 11 laws and regulations, says bitcoin is not a currency or an asset within the purview of professional trading or asset management, while trading the virtual currency is not a banking or financial-instrument transaction.
But, generally speaking, bitcoin could be taxable if it meets certain conditions of income, corporate or consumption tax laws, the statement says. This leaves open the possibility that bitcoin could be treated as a commodity like gold, although the statement does not specify this.
Regarding money laundering, certain transactions   whether with bitcoin or not   require people to identify themselves, it notes. The 6-page document is the government s official response to questions posed by Tsutomu Okubo, a member of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan and former managing director at Morgan Stanley.

Japan has ruled that bitcoin is not legal tender but could still be the subject of taxation and anti money-laundering rules.
The Japanese Ministry of Finance admitted it did not really understand the crypto-currency despite the fact the country was home to its largest trading exchange, Mt.Gox, until it went bust last week.  It s not money,  said finance minister Taro Aso adding that  opinions are divided  as to which agency controls it.
A six-page document drawn up for the government suggests that bitcoin could be treated like a commodity such as gold.

Mar 10, 2014 at 9:17 AM Mar 10, 2014 at 1:16 PM
UPDATE (12:56 p.m.): NEW YORK - The Metro-North employee killed by a train this morning has been identified as James Romansoff, 58, of Yonkers.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the railroad said Romansoff, an eight-year employee of the power department, was part of a crew that was restoring power to tracks that had been closed for weekend maintenance when the incident occurred.
The 12:47 a.m. Hudson line train from Grand Central Terminal to Poughkeepsie struck Romansoff at 12:54 a.m., when the crew was working near 106th Street on the Park Avenue viaduct. He died shortly afterward at Mount Sinai Hospital. The 36 passengers on the train were transferred to another train and resumed their trip at 2:17 a.m.
"The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family,'' said Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti in a statement. "Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad. With our partners at the Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, we will re-examine our procedures and protocols to ensure we are performing our jobs with safety as the paramount concern."
The NTSB and FRA are investigating the incident with the MTA Police Department and Metro-North.

NEW YORK - A Metro-North employee was struck by a train at 12:54 a.m. today and later died at Mount Sinai Hospital.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the railroad said the employee was working on the tracks at Park Avenue and East 106th Street in Manhattan when the incident occurred. His identify is being withheld pending notification of his family.
The Hudson line train had departed Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m. en route to Poughkeepsie, carrying about 50 passengers. The passengers were moved to another train and resumed their trip about 2:17 a.m.
In May, a Metro-North employee was struck and killed while he was working on the tracks in West Haven, Conn. The incident was attributed to a student controller prematurely putting the line back in service and resulted in the railroad changing its proceedures for track work.
The MTA Police Department and Metro-North are investigating the incident.

MANHATTAN   An MTA worker died after being struck by a Metro-North train in East Harlem Monday morning, officials said.
James Romansoff, 58, was finishing up weekend track work with two others near Park Avenue and East 106th Street when the train hit him about 1 a.m., MTA and FDNY officials said.
Preliminary investigation indicated it was an accident and that the worker left the blocked off work area to retrieve an item when he was hit, sources said.
"They knew the train was coming, but he apparently walked off for something," a source said.
Romansoff, who had worked for the MTA for eight years, was taken to Mount Sinai hospital and pronounced dead, the MTA said.
"The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family,  said Metro-North President, Joseph Giulietti.
Romansoff and his crew were restoring power to the tracks after they were closed for weekend maintenance, the MTA said.
Neighbors described hearing a loud screech about 1 a.m.
Jovanna McCoy, who was at her mother's home at 102nd Street and Park Avenue, ran to the window overlooking the elevated tracks and watched as emergency responders converged on the accident site, she said.
"I'm devastated to find out this man has died," McCoy said.
Thirty-six people were aboard the Hudson line train that had just left Grand Central en route to Poughkeepsie, the MTA said.
The motorman knew about work in the area and was driving accordingly before he hit Romansoff, sources said.
The passengers were transferred to another train and continued their journey north about 2:15 a.m., the MTA said.
The train that hit Romansoff was taken away by daybreak, McCoy said.
The MTA, along with two federal agencies, was still investigating the circumstances of the incident, a spokesman said.
The National Transportation Safety Board was dispatching three investigators , they said.
"Keeping our customers and employees safe is the most important job we have on the railroad," Giulietti said.
Monday's train fatality came seven days after the MTA unveiled its " 100-Day Action Plan ," a list of proposals to improve safety throughout Metro-North in light of the Dec. 1 derailment that killed 4 people and injured dozens more.
The plan, which includes a proposal to give track workers a confidential code that they have to send dispatchers before trains can return to the rails, is intended to strengthen safety procedures, according to the MTA.
The plan has not been fully implemented, an MTA spokeswoman said.
It was not clear if any of the safety proposals could have prevented the Monday morning fatality.

A veteran Metro-North worker was struck and killed by a train in East Harlem early Monday, the latest in a series of accidents at the beleaguered commuter railroad.
The employee, 58-year-old James Romansoff, was working on the tracks near East 106th Street and Park Avenue when he was hit by a Poughkeepsie-bound Hudson Line train that left Grand Central Terminal at 12:47 a.m., a Metro-North spokesman said.
The Yonkers man had spent eight years with the railroad's power department, and was part of a crew restoring power to tracks that had been closed for weekend maintenance work when he was hit.
Service was suspended while emergency crews worked, and the three dozen passengers on the train that hit the worker were transferred to another train. Service was restored before the morning rush. 
"The entire Metro-North family mourns the loss of a colleague and a friend and we offer our deepest condolences to Jim Romansoff's family," Metro-North President Joseph Giulietti said in a statement. 
Metro-North authorities and MTA police are investigating, along with the National Transportation Safety Board.
Metro-North has been plagued with problems over the past year, including the death of a worker on the tracks in West Haven, Conn. last spring. In that case, the worker was hit by a train on a supposedly inactive section of track.
Also last spring,  two trains collided  during the evening rush in Connecticut, injuring more than 60 people.
And in December, a speeding train derailed in the Bronx , killing four people and injuring dozens more. The Federal Railroad Administration is expected to release its review of the December derailment in a week. 
Six months before that derailment, a  freight train hauling trash derailed  on the same curve.
And in September,  a feeder cable in Mount Vernon, N.Y., failed , knocking out power for 12 days on the Metro-North s New Haven line, which carries 132,000 customers daily.

Democrat donor William Ackman conspires to destroy Herbalife to win billion-dollar bet

If the billionaire Koch brothers are trying to  buy our democracy,  as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D-Nev., put it, what is Democrat donor William Ackman buying?
The billionaire hedge fund manager has conspired with members of Congress and outside groups to destroy Herbalife, a nutrition products company, according to the New York Times .
Why?
To win a billion-dollar bet he made that the company would collapse.
And he s using the federal government to help win that bet.
Despite what you may believe about the seediness of Washington, this is actually unprecedented.
 Mr. Ackman s campaign to take this fight  to the end of the earth,  using every weapon in the arsenal that Washington offers in an attempt to bring ruin to one company, is a novel one, fusing the financial markets with the political system,  the Times said.
Ackman claims he is trying to take down the company to protect Hispanics, who are apparently Herbalife s main distributors, but Ackman s staff says the real goal is to win that bet.
The situation has led to a prominent Democrat-on-Democrat lobbying effort.
Also from the Washington Examiner
 
12/30/16 8:13 PM
Ackman read from a letter he said was written by Rep. Linda Sanchez , D-Calif., to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation into Herbalife. The thing is, the FTC hadn't received the letter yet, and Sanchez didn't post the letter on her website until a month later -- but backdated it for good measure.
Another letter, supposedly written by Sen. Ed Markey , D-Mass., also appeared on Ackman's anti-Herbalife website before the senator's press release. Markey's letter to the FTC and Securities and Exchange Commission caused Herbalife's stock to drop by 14 percent.
Ackman also enlisted lobbying firms to help crush Herbalife   including one run by former Rep. Toby Moffett, D-Conn. The other firm is run by a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, Robert Walker.
But wait, there's more! Ackman also hired lobbying firms run by former top aides for President Obama and President Clinton , as well as Jim Papa, who worked on legislative affairs for Obama.
Also contracted: Lobbyist Larry Rasky, a former aide to Markey during his time in the House of Representatives, and lobbyist Malcolm Grace, a former aide to Sanchez. How convenient that both members of Congress would go on to assist Ackman.

The New York Times has a long article detailing the lobbying on both sides, but particularly Bill Ackman's short-selling side, of the battle over Herbalife. Earlier coverage of Herbalife and of Mr. Ackman from this site is here , here , and here .
Not among the three bylines on the Times article is Alison Leigh Cowan, who was described in the book Confidence Game as Mr. Ackman's pipeline into the Times. The Times article reports:
In a book about his MBIA wager called "Confidence Game," the reporter-turned-financial analyst Christine S. Richard chronicled how he fought with regulators for seven years before his prediction that MBIA stock would "spiral downward" came true. In a twist, it was Ms. Richard, who left Bloomberg News to start up the Wall Street research shop Indago Group, who gave Mr. Ackman the idea to short Herbalife.
The press can be almost as powerful as, or even more powerful than, the regulators in these high-stakes battles involving shortsellers and battleground stocks. While the Times does a good job of tracing the role of the regulators, politicians, lobbyists, and advocacy groups, it leaves the press's own role mostly unexplored.

The New York Times has an extensive report about how, after staking $1 billion on the collapse of the nutritional supplement company, Bill Ackman s activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has been aggressively lobbying to bring the company down.
An investigation by the Times found Ackman s team has helped organize protests and letter-writing campaigns across the U.S. to pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife. Ackman retained the Dewey Square Group, a Washington-based firm that specializes in  grass-roots advocacy,  to influence officials by recruiting surrogates to speak out against Herbalife in emails, letters, tweets or rallies, the Times said.
The report says Ackman s team has paid civil-rights organizations at least $130,000 to collect names of people who claim they were victimized by Herbalife. Ackman has argued that he is trying to protect Hispanics, who he says are most frequently recruited by Herbalife as distributors   only to find out that there is little money to be made from selling the supplements.
Herbalife has mobilized its own lobbyists to defend itself. Last month, the Times says, the company held a private briefing for more than 30 Capitol Hill aides to argue against Ackman s charges.
The Times points out Ackman so far has little to show for his efforts. Herbalife s stock has risen, in part because billionaire investor Carl Icahn decided to buy a large stake in the company, and regulators lobbied by Ackman haven t take any formal action against Herbalife.

Summary
Herbalife, which ended last week with shaky trading, will be the subject of a Bill Ackman presentation next week.
A powerful culinary workers union has joined the outcry for an investigation into the company.
Herbalife far outspent Bill Ackman in lobbying in 2013, as profiled by Reuters.
Introduction
I should have never promised not to write on Herbalife ( HLF ) again until after Bill Ackman's conference call - coming this Tuesday - on why Herbalife is allegedly an illegal pyramid scheme in China. And, it should please Herbalife longs to know that due to my travel plans, it's looking like I'm going to be airborne during the call, so I'm going to miss the live version and will have to catch the replay when I land and I'm settled.
There have been a few blips of new news on Herbalife over the last few days and since I penned my last article. I wanted to lay that news out so that longs and shorts alike are on somewhat of a level playing field in the coming week leading up to Ackman's presentation. Here's the 4 things you need to know leading up to this week in the Herbalife saga:
1. Last Week's Trading Was Anything But Confidence Inspiring
The trading leading up to Ackman's coming presentation has looked anything but strong. As the Dow and S&P both climbed over the last month, Herbalife has shown some uncertainty. It finished the week last week looking weak on considerable volume.
If the company didn't have its current buyout underneath it as a floor, I'd be interested to see how the stock would be trading. Could this be shaky knees going into a week where the bearish case is going to get yet another nudge?
2. Herbalife Bulls Won "FTC Re-Tweet-Gate" / Enter "Survey-Gate"
I actually wrote an article that acknowledged that bulls won a small argument over the last week. My editors, citing lack of major content, had me submit it to my blog rather than publish it. I covered this semi-non-news event in my Instablog, which you can read right here . It concerned the FTC re-tweeting a question sent by an Herbalife bear asking when the FTC was going to intervene and shut down the company.
And, you can always head over to @ArbitrageIt on Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) to check out the current sub-plot, which is a user named "AS" (an HLF bear) arguing with a user (TheSkeptic21) over whether or not some suspicious looking alleged Herbalife surveys that seem to have went out last week were the product of the company itself, TheSkeptic21, or someone trying to pass themselves off as TheSkeptic21. I didn't get into the thick of this one yet, as I took off from writing and spent most of the weekend sampling various alcoholic beverages. It was fantastic.
3. A Powerful Union Joins the Bear Side
Last week, the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 - an extremely powerful union with Latino ties - called on the NV state attorney general to investigate Herbalife, stating the company was "unfairly targeting minority groups and luring them into a losing business deal."
To the best of my knowledge, ValueWalk was the one to break the story :
Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE: HLF ), the highly controversial multilevel marketing company selling nutritional and weight loss products faces another foe - the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, one of the most influential unions in the country.
Geoconda Arguello-Kline, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, urged Nevada Attorney General Catherine Masto and Federal Trade Commission (NASDAQ: FTC ) Chairperson Edith Ramirez to investigate the allegations that Herbalife Ltd (NYSE: HLF ) is a pyramid scheme
4. Details on Lobbying in 2013 Covered by Reuters
A recent article by Reuters touched on the amount Herbalife and Bill Ackman have spent on lobbying for their side of the case on the Herbalife trade:
Ackman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground however, falling 17 percent.
Pershing Square also paid $84,000 to Moffett Group, run by former U.S. Representative Toby Moffett, who promises to bring clients' messages to the highest levels in Washington.
The bulk of its lobbying budget, $150,000, went to Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, which describes itself as a full service government affairs firm.
During the same year, Herbalife spent at total $1.89 million on lobbying, according to public data from the Center for Responsive Politics.
Herbalife paid $250,000 to government relations firm Downey McGrath, which counted Boeing , Microsoft and Time Warner among its past clients.
IBC earned $30,000 from Herbalife last year while $140,000 went to Ogilvy, $160,000 was paid to Podesta Group and $40,000 went to Glover Park Group.
Herbalife also spent $1.27 million on lobbying on its own behalf.
Separately the company made a $10,000 donation last year to Democratic Attorneys General Association, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Pershing Square did not donate to this group. California's Attorney General, Kamala Harris, the person the Latin civil rights group LULAC last year asked to probe Herbalife is a Democrat.
Conclusion
We have just two days until Bill Ackman releases his next set of arguments as to whether or not Herbalife is a pyramid scheme in China. The company, unlike Nu Skin (NYSE: NUS ), only does about 11% of its business in China. My guess is that Ackman is going to be trying to set a precedent here - if China shuts down Herbalife, he can use that when going after other countries as a precedent.
I'll likely cover the conference call when I get a chance to listen to it in depth after traveling. I remain firmly bearish on Herbalife and think upside is limited at this point. With the risk looming and a 52 week high around $80, upside seems to only be about 20% for Herbalife in the short term - at least until the Ackman/Icahn dispute is settled. A short can theoretically yield you 100% no matter what price you sell it. I've long awaited being on the right side of a potential "short at will", and think that Herbalife could potentially be that trade for me.
Best of luck to all investors.
Disclosure: I am short HLF. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. I hold/sold various Herbalife calls and puts in various bearish spreads and reserve the right to add to or sell my position at any time.

Both Bill Ackman and Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) have spent a lot of money on lobbying efforts aimed to help them get their way. Ackman wants to discredit Herbalife as a pyramid scheme, while Herbalife is trying to convince regulators, lawmakers and consumer advocates that it isn t a pyramid scheme. So far as Herbalife shares have risen, Ackman s bet against the company got him into the red there. However, CNBC reports that he s spent less on lobbying than Herbalife has. But then as they say, money talks, and of course there s also the fact that Herbalife has so far anyway been winning the lobbying battle.
Ackman spends thousands, Herbalife spends millions
The network reports that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) spent almost $2 million in its lobbying efforts last year. Bill Ackman, on the other hand, spent $264,000 last year to lobby against the company. Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF) is trying to convince policy makers that it isn t a pyramid scheme, which is defined as a company in which distributors make more money for recruiting new distributors that they do for actually selling the company s products.
Ackman reportedly hired three Washington lobbyists last year, making it the first time the fund has ever hired lobbyists, according to the U.S. Senate Disclosure Act Database. The filing indicates that Ibarra Strategy Group earned $30,000 from Ackman s Pershing Square Capital Management fund during 2013. That firm specializes in outreach to the Latino community. The activist investor maintains that Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) unfairly targets minorities and low income communities, although the company says it does not. The Moffett Group earned $84,000 from Pershing Square, while Wexler and Walker Public Policy Associates earned $150,000 from the firm.
Pershing may be stepping up its lobbying efforts this year, as the firm s latest attempts have focused on discrediting Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) s top distributors.
Will U.S. regulators investigate Herbalife?
Consumer advocates, including at least one Latina organization, have called for an investigation into Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF) s business practices. U.S. Sen. Ed Markey also called for a probe, sending letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both agencies refused to give a definitive answer on whether they were investigating, although the FTC said it was considering Sen. Markey s request for an investigation.

Bill Ackman's crusade against Herbalife.
The New York Times has a good blow-by-blow for anyone who hasn't been paying attention, although anyone who has been following Ackman's big short probably won't find any major surprises. Here's a taste: "To pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife, an act that alone could cause its stock to dive, his team has helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns in California, Nevada, Connecticut, New York and Illinois, although several of the people who signed the letters to state and federal officials say they do not remember sending them, an investigation by the New York Times has found. His team has also paid civil rights organizations at least $130,000 to join his effort by helping him collect the names of people who claimed they were victimized by Herbalife in order to send the leads to regulators, the investigation found." Paying six figures to civil-rights organizations as part of a campaign to drive down a company's stock price does look more than a little weird, doesn't it? Keep hope alive.
Why Chinese banks keep bailing out the trust products they sold.
This article from Institutional Investor helps explain it, as does this anecdote in particular from a customer at China Construction Bank named Alicia Dou who gave in and bought one after the bank pitched her more than 10 times: "I remember reading the fine print on the certificate: `The bank doesn't guarantee the safety of this investment.' I asked the teller about it, and she said, `Just ignore that: It's standard contract language. I can tell you our bank will guarantee your money back plus the interest stated on the certificate.' Though I enjoyed a 12 percent gain, I decided one year of risk was all I was willing to take." And in a bailout-oriented economy, she's the sucker because she acted prudently by taking her money out.
The pros and cons of central banks' forward guidance .
This comes from two economists at the Bank for International Settlements, Andrew Filardo and Boris Hofmann. So far, they write, forward guidance by the four major central banks has "reduced the volatility of near-term expectations about the future path of policy interest rates, suggesting that near-term policy intentions have been clarified." But this has come with risks to the central banks' reputations as well as to financial stability. Worth a read.
Add this to the list of things an investment bank shouldn't do.
Let's say there's a bank that wants to finance a buyout where the terms are still being negotiated. Now let's say it would be accurate to describe the bank's activities as: "one team of a bank wooing the likely buyer while another gives the seller advice that makes the buyer's offer look good." This is known as playing both sides and could get the bank sued, which is what happened to RBC Capital Markets in connection with a bid by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus to buy an ambulance operator, Rural/Metro. The Wall Street Journal has a good roundup of a ruling in which a Delaware judge found that RBC "failed to disclose the relevant information to further its own opportunity to close a deal, get paid its contingent fee, and receive additional and far greater fees for buy-side financing work."
Why investors should avoid King Digital Entertainment's initial public offering.
Good piece by James Surowiecki in the New Yorker: "The IPO is no surprise, given King's domination of the booming mobile-game business, but it's likely to end badly, because King is part of a venerable tradition: the one-hit wonder. Like Coleco, with Cabbage Patch Kids, or Ty, Inc., with Beanie Babies, King's business is dependent on its one star product; although the company has more than a hundred titles, almost eighty per cent of its revenue comes from Candy Crush. King has done a great job of making money from the game, and of keeping it fresh, but Candy Crush is still a fad, and, like all fads, it will fade."
Yet another reason to hate flying .
Virgin Atlantic has a dancing air steward named Michael who does high kicks and splits during the safety routine.

William   Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, speaks at the   Partner Connect 2013 conference in Boston Thomson Reuters
BOSTON   (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who is betting   $1.16 billion that Herbalife is a fraud, spent $264,000 last year   on lobbyists to press his case against the company, according to   government documents filed in recent weeks.
That amount is dwarfed by the nearly $2 million Herbalife spent   in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss   company fought the billionaire investor's claims it runs a   pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more   for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the   products outside the network.
Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired   three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New   York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists,   data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database show.
In October Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing   Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filingshows.
The group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of   Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton,   specializes in Latino outreach.
Ackman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities.   Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens,   which has asked California's Attorney General to probe Herbalife,   echoed the fund manager's accusations. Herbalife said last month   that it does not target members of minorities or low income   communities.
The battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year   with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers   as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company's   fate.
In the last days, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the   Federal Trade Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward   Markey, who asked them to probe the company, what they were doing   on Herbalife. But each offered plenty of examples of having shut   down illegal businesses before.
SEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of   shareholder activism, said the SEC's Enforcement Division has   previously probed whether statements made about a business are   "materially false or misleading, including statements regarding   the compensation levels."
Ackman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn   nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife   distributors' testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as   an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said   distributors results' depend on time, energy and dedication.
Ackman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to   zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in   the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent   in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground   however, falling 17 percent.
Pershing Square also paid $84,000 to Moffett Group, run by former   U.S. Representative Toby Moffett, who promises to bring clients'   messages to the highest levels in Washington.
The bulk of its lobbying budget, $150,000, went to Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates, which describes itself as a full   service government affairs firm.
During the same year, Herbalife spent at total $1.89 million on   lobbying, according to public data from the Center for Responsive   Politics.
Herbalife paid $250,000 to government relations firm Downey   McGrath, which counted Boeing, Microsoft and Time Warner among   its past clients.
IBC earned $30,000 from Herbalife last year while $140,000 went   to Ogilvy, $160,000 was paid to Podesta Group and $40,000 went to   Glover Park Group.
Herbalife also spent $1.27 million on lobbying on its own behalf.
Separately the company made a $10,000 donation last year to   Democratic Attorneys General Association, according to the Center   for Responsive Politics. Pershing Square did not donate to this   group. California's Attorney General, Kamala Harris, the person   the Latin civil rights group LULAC last year asked to probe   Herbalife is a Democrat.

Frequent fliers are now navigating the new conditions that spurned from American Airlines s merge with US Airways in December to form American Airlines Group ( NASDAQ:AAL ). According to Reuters, American Airlines and JetBlue Airways ( NYSE:JBLU ) are severing an interline agreement that allowed customers to buy connecting flights on each other s planes on one ticket.
The two carriers said in a statement this week that American Airlines and JetBlue will not accept new interline ticket sales with each other starting Monday, and customers using their reciprocal frequent-flyers programs will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, effective April 1.
Air travelers are expected to be disappointed that they can no longer mix and match their flight connections between American and JetBlue, considering the two parties  interline agreement made it easier for fliers to reap the benefits of convenient ticketing and frequent-flyer programs. However, American Airlines maintains the belief that thanks to its merger with US Airways, the newly minted company no longer needs JetBlue to help it satisfy its customers  needs.
American Airlines  spokesman Casey Norton explained in an email written to Reuters,  Through the merger with US Airways, American s network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement. 
American Airlines and JetBlue initially decided to secure their interline agreement because it helped both parties offer more destinations without making large investments. It was especially helpful for American Airlines that about 80 percent of JetBlue s operations take place in the U.S. Northeast. Before its merge with US Airways, the carrier had an inadequate amount of operations supporting the East Coast. After joining forcers with US Airways, American Airlines maintains that its business is fine without JetBlue, although some analysts still believe a continued truce wouldn t hurt either party.
JetBlue will still maintain similar partnerships with around thirty other carriers. According to Reuters, despite its separation from American Airlines, JetBlue still expects its unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, to rise 1 to 2 percent in the current quarter, and the New York-based company isn t worried about the health of its business in the future.
American Airlines shares sat down 0.18 percent at $38.95 as of 2 p.m. Eastern on Monday, while those of JetBlue were down 1.94 percent at $8.85, following the two companies  statement. The carriers also explained this week that All American Airlines   AAdvantage  miles or JetBlue s  TrueBlue  points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers  accounts and will not be affected.

U.S. airlines see first quarter profits hit by storm cancellations

Major U.S. airlines on Monday said cancellations of thousands of flights would hurt first-quarter profit, but some added that revenue would still show improvement.
Flight cancellations tend to add to airline costs during the first quarter, when winter storms hit the hardest. Five U.S. carriers - Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL.N), American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O), Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) and United Continental Holdings Inc (UAL.N) - said that winter storms had led to more than 78,000 canceled flights among them.
Some airlines cited a noticeable increase in their canceled flights tied to bad weather this year, with American Airlines saying its 28,000 cancellations for January and February more than doubled from the year earlier.
Delta said that as of the end of January, its cancellations from bad weather had topped all of those for 2013.
Delta told a J.P. Morgan investor conference disruption from winter storms hurt revenue for the current quarter by $90 million as it canceled 17,000 flights. The storms dented pretax profit for the quarter by about $55 million, Delta added.
The carrier said it expected operating margin, a measure of income to costs, of 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent for the first quarter, compared with a prior view of 6 percent to 8 percent.
Cancellations can help unit revenue, an important measure of pricing power and how full planes are, as more travelers are put on remaining flights.
Delta said unit revenue would rise 3 percent to 4 percent in the current quarter, compared with its prior view of a 2 percent to 4 percent increase. American added it still expected unit revenue to rise about 2 percent to 4 percent in the period.
United said it halted 23,000 flights tied to weather in the first two months of 2014. The company had disclosed last month that disruption from the storms would hurt first-quarter unit revenue.
JetBlue told the same conference it canceled nearly 4,000 flights because of the winter storms, and Southwest said it halted about 6,500 flights in January and February.
JetBlue forecast a 1 percent to 2 percent rise in first quarter unit revenue, while Southwest outlined expected growth of 3 percent.
Cowen & Co airline analyst Helane Becker cut her first quarter profit estimate for Delta to 30 cents a share from 32 cents in a note to clients, citing the updated outlook. She raised her quarterly estimate for Southwest to 17 cents a share from 14 cents, but also cut her estimate for JetBlue for the period to 6 cents a share from 13 cents.
Shares of the major U.S. airlines ended mixed, with Delta down 0.5 percent to $35.17 and United off 2.3 percent to $46.66. American was off 0.2 percent to $38.96 and JetBlue fell 1.8 percent to $8.87. Southwest shares rose 2.2 percent to $23.60.

American Airlines & JetBlue: Le Divorce
By Ben Levisohn
Last month, Wolfe Research s Hunter Keay stated his belief that the partnership between JetBlue ( JBLU ) and American Airlines ( AAL ) would come to an end . That day has finally come.
The Wall Street Journal has the details :
American Airlines Group Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp.agreed to end their partnership, which has been in effect since 2010.
Starting Monday, the airlines will stop accepting new interline sales on the other carrier, while on April 1, customers will stop earning miles and points from each when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline. Customers  already-accrued miles and points won t be affected and will be credited to their accounts, the airlines said.
Cowen s Helane Becker and Conor Cunningham explain the significance for JetBlue and American Airlines:
 American Airlines and JetBlue announced they will terminate their partnership agreement. This is not a complete surprise as we expected US Airways could provide American the feed they need in New York. More to the point, we expect New York to be less important to American going forward as US Airways has a large hub in Philadelphia. The American Airlines interline agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program will be terminated on April 1. The two carriers had agreements on routes from Boston Logan and New York JFK airports. Neither company has announced the financial impact of the interline agreement; however, we believe the impact is more negative for JetBlue.
Shares of JetBlue have fallen 1.4% to $8.90 at 1:27 p.m., while American Airlines has risen 0.1% to $39.06. Delta Air Lines ( DAL ) has fallen 0.8% to $35.09 and United Continental Holdings ( UAL ) is off 2.2% as $46.72.

UPDATE 2-American Airlines to end ticketing agreement with JetBlue
* To end ticketing agreement effective Monday
* To also end reciprocal frequent-flyer program
* Merger with US Airways gives "greater connectivity" - spokesman
March 10 American Airlines said it planned to end agreements covering ticketing, baggage handling and frequent-flyer programs with JetBlue Airways after its merger with US Airways gave it "greater connectivity" along the U.S. East Coast.
American Airlines, which merged with US Airways in December to form American Airlines Group Inc, had a so-called interline agreement with JetBlue that allowed customers to buy connecting flights on each other's planes on one ticket.
New York-based JetBlue has 80 percent of its operations in the U.S. Northeast.
"Through the merger with US Airways, American's network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement," American Airlines' spokesman Casey Norton wrote in an email to Reuters.
Carriers enter into interline agreements because they allow them to offer more destinations without having to make large investments.
The partnership with American Airlines was "not overly material when we think about the other partnerships that we have," JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said at a JP Morgan conference in New York City on Monday.
JetBlue, which has similar agreements with 30 other carriers, also said it expected unit revenue, a measure of passenger revenue per available seat mile, to rise 1-2 percent in the current quarter.
American Airlines and JetBlue will not accept new interline ticket sales with each other from Monday, the companies said in a statement.
The carriers also said customers using their reciprocal frequent-flyer programs would no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes, effective April 1.
The frequent-flyer program agreement between the two includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.
All American Airlines' "AAdvantage" miles or JetBlue's "TrueBlue" points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers' accounts and will not be affected, the carriers said.
American Airlines Group also said its February load factor, or percentage of seats sold, fell to 78.4 percent from 78.7 percent a year earlier.
American Airlines shares were down about 1 percent at $38.55 in early trading. JetBlue's shares were down 0.55 percent.

UPDATE, 6:40 p.m.: American Airlines said Monday the JetBlue Airways relationship was no longer necessary, leading it to break off the interline arrangement.
"Through the merger with US Airways, American s network along the East Coast provides greater connectivity and customer benefits and as a result, there is no longer a need to supplement our combined network coverage with the JetBlue agreement," spokesman Casey Norton said.
UPDATE, 12:25 p.m.: JetBlue Airways said it was American Airlines' idea to break up their partnership.
"Not surprisingly, we were advised last week that American Airlines is going to break-off the interline relationship that we have had in place with American Airlines," JetBlue CEO Dave Barger told participants in a J.P. Morgan conference Monday in New York.
" Not surprising, when we consider what transpired with the recent integration with U.S. Airways. And as we look at the partnership which we were very pleased with, it s unfortunate. We re in the process of advising customers," Barger said.
But the end of the relationship "is not overly meaningful when we think our material, when we think about the other partnerships that we have wrapped around it," Barger said.
ORIGINAL ITEM: At one time, many believed that American Airlines and JetBlue would tighten their loose marketing arrangement, and some speculated that the two might eventually merger. American coveted the huge numbers of passengers that JetBlue carried into and out of New York Kennedy.
But that was before American merged with US Airways, and American s management changed significantly.
For whatever reasons, JetBlue and American announced Monday they were ending their interline agreement in which the two would exchange passengers at JFK and Boston. You won't be able to buy a single ticket that combines the flights of both carriers.
In their somewhat terse releases, the carriers stated:
American Airlines and JetBlue Airways plan to terminate their interline traffic agreement and reciprocal frequent flyer program accrual agreement, which includes select routes from Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) and New York s John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK).
Beginning today, each airline will no longer accept new interline sales for travel on the other carrier. Effective April 1, customers will no longer earn miles or points when traveling on eligible routes operated by the other airline.
All American AAdvantage miles or JetBlue TrueBlue points already accrued through this partnership will be credited to customers  accounts and are not affected. The two airlines are working together to ensure these changes have little impact to customers.
Analyst Helane Becker of Cowen & Co. suggested that the split would be "more negative" for JetBlue than for American, which is picking up eastern passengers through its Dec. 9 merger with US Airways.
"This is not a complete surprise as we expected US Airways could provide American the feed they need in New York," Becker wrote in a research note Monday. "More to the point, we expect New York to be less important to American going forward as US Airways has a large hub in Philadelphia.'

Transit ridership reaches highest level since 1956

KUSA- Ridership on public transportation last year grew 1.1% to 10.7 billion trips, the highest total since 1956, according to new data from the American Public Transportation Association.
Since 1995, transit ridership is up 37.2%, which outpaced the national population growth of 20.3%, says Michael Melaniphy, APTA president and CEO.
The nation's trains, buses and commuter rail carried more trips last year than in 2008, when gas prices soared to $4-$5 per gallon and many were forced out of their cars by necessity. That year saw the highest ridership totals since 1957.
"There's a fundamental shift going on," Melaniphy says. "This isn't a one-year blip. More and more people are deciding that public transportation is a good option."
Denver saw a double digit rise in light rail ridership last year.
RTD credits that in large part to the opening of the West Rail line.
A trip is considered any segment of a passenger's commute. For instance, a person who takes a bus to the subway and takes that to work has taken two trips.
Melaniphy says public transit systems in cities large and small, and in suburban and rural communities are seeing ridership increases. "We're talking about both red states and blue states here. They're saying we want these (transit) investments made. The economy's coming back, and people are saying, Man, I'm riding transit."
Alan Pisarski, editor of the Commuting in America series, says public transportation's image is improving. "There are areas where there is a more positive view of transit," he says. "I think in some areas, people do have a more positive view."
He notes, however, that while transit carried more trips last year than at any time since the Eisenhower administration, its share of the transportation mode   that is, the percentage of commuters who take transit versus driving, walking, etc.   is still well below what it was in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.
In 1960, 12.1% of commuters took public transportation. That dropped to 8.9% 10 years later to 6.2% in 1980, Pisarski says. By 2000, the percentage was 4.6%, but it rose at the end of the decade. Transit's share of the transportation mode was 5% in 2012.
"It's probably not fair to expect them to do those kinds of numbers again," Pisarski says. "You're talking about a society where probably 30% of the society didn't own a vehicle. Now, less than 10% of households don't have a vehicle, and only 3% of households with workers don't have a vehicle."
For Dustin Lemke, public transportation has been a good decision.
Lemke, 38, is a professor of communication at Hillsborough Community College in Tampa. He sold his 2006 Honda Accord in 2010 as soon as he paid off the note and started taking Hillsborough Area Regional Transit (HART) buses everywhere: to work, to his volunteer job at the Tampa Public Library, to kick it with friends in Ybor City, known as Tampa's Latin Quarter, even to his Quaker meeting house for worship services.
"I love it," he says. "It hasn't slowed me down a bit."

Transit ridership is back on track
Use of bus, train highest since '56.
Mar 10, 2014
1
LOS ANGELES (AP)   Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time since the suburbs began booming.
Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise   the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released today by the American Public Transportation Association.
Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored after economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.
"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."
Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.
Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased 6 percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained 9 million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.
Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for 1 in 3 trips nationally.
Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.
"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."

Mass transit use up nationally, but TriMet ridership down
by GOSIA WOZNIACKA, Associated Press

AA
PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - While the use of buses, trains and subways is on the rise in many U.S. cities , ridership in the Portland region's much touted TriMet system has fallen off.
New data released by the American Public Transportation Association shows it was down 3.8 percent from the past year.
In 2013, TriMet recorded 98.8 million rides, compared to about 102.7 million rides in 2012.
TriMet's spokeswoman Mary Fetsch says the recent decrease is due to the elimination of the Free Rail Zone in Portland, fare hikes, more fare enforcement, and service cuts made during the recession.
The agency says it has added back more bus service in September and has restored frequent bus service on its busiest Portland routes. A new Portland-to-Milwaukie light rail line is also slated to open in 2015.
Ridership on MAX, the TriMet's light rail, saw the largest dip, 6.1 percent. Some 38.4 million trips were taken on MAX in 2013, about 2,000 less than the previous year.
TriMet bus ridership also decreased 2.4 percent, going from about 60.4 million rides in 2012 to about 58.9 million in 2013.
The area's commuter rail line saw more success. The Westside Express Service or WES, which connects Beaverton and Wilsonville, saw a 10 percent increase in ridership. Rides increased from 430,000 in 2012 to 480,000 in 2013.
Federal officials have previously hailed Portland area's public transportation as visionary, easy to use and a model for other cities. TriMet's bus and MAX routes carry a combined 312,000 riders on an average weekday.
Over the past two decades, ridership of TriMet has steadily increased until the Great Recession and then leveled. It declined, especially on MAX, between 2012 and 2013.
Other mass transit systems in Oregon also didn't see much rise in ridership.
The Salem-Keizer Transit, popularly known as Cherriots, also saw a decrease of 2.4 percent. And ridership of Wilsonville's South Metro Area Regional Transit  aka SMART  remained stagnant.
Nationally, public transit systems saw the highest total of rides since 1956  nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013. Cities such as Houston, New York, Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego saw large ridership gains.

Americans took 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last   year, the most since 1957, according to a new report from the American   Public Transportation Association (APTA).
From 2012 to 2013, public transit use rose 1.1%, while miles   driven rose .3%. Since 1995, public transit use has grown by   37.2%, while the population rose 20.3%. Some of the biggest   growth came from commuter rail services, whose use climbed 2.1%:   Austin, Philadelphia, Anchorage, Minneapolis, and Portland,   Oregon all reported double-digit increases.
The APTA report attributes the growth to the economic recovery,   which creates more commutes, and federal investment in public   transit. "That is why Congress needs to act this year to pass a   new transportation bill," APTA President and CEO Michael   Melaniphy said in a press release.

Record Number Of Public Transportation Trips Taken In 2013
By Emily Nelson

In 2013 IndyGo ridership hit its highest level since 1991.
As the legislature debates whether to let Central Indiana voters decide whether to expand public transit, a new report shows there is more demand for seats on buses and trains.
The number of rides taken on public transportation systems in the United States last year was the highest it has been since the 1950s, according to a report from the American Public Transportation Association  released today.
While Indiana has less public transportation than some other states, it is in line with the upward trend.
The new report shows ridership in Bloomington increased 1.6 percent and 2.7 percent in Indianapolis in 2013.
IndyGo reported more than 10.2 million dixed route trips taken on its buses, its highest number since 1991.
President and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association Michael Melaniphy says the report s findings reveal a fundamental change in people s lifestyles.
 2008 was a high watermark when fuel was over four dollars here and five dollars on the West Coast,  he says.  People were flocking to transit, they came, they found out they liked it and they stayed. Now fuel is well under four dollars and they re continuing to stay. It s also driven by growth and the economy. As people go back to work they re riding transit more. About 50 percent of all trips are on transit. 
According to the Indiana Department of Transportation s 2012 Public Transit Report, one percent of people over 16 used public transportation to get to work in Indiana, compared to the national average of 5.2 percent. A new proposed bill to expand mass transit in Central Indiana, however, could help to increase these rates.
Vice President of Government Relations for the Greater Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce Mark Fisher supports the bill and says the new report attests to public transportation s long-term viability.
 People are choosing different lifestyles than they were even 10 or 15 years ago where it was a continuous push out to suburbs. Transit provides a very cost-effective option for them to be able to move around their community,  Fisher says.
If the proposed bill passes, funding would come from fares as well as business and local income taxes.
Network Indiana contributed to this report.

More Americans relied on public transit (bus and rail) in 2013 than in any year since 1956, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) said Monday, March 10, 2014.
APTA said overall transit ridership rose 1.1% during 2013, with almost 10.7 billion trips taken on public transport, recovering from somewhat depressed levels attributed to the Great Recession.
"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said APTA President and CEO Michael Melaniphy. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."
Among other large systems, Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) light rail transit ridership rose 6% from 2012 levels, in part due to LACMTA's expanding LRT reach. Including bus transport, LACMTA ridership rose 1.9% over 2012 levels.
New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority ridership on regional rail, subway, and bus lines rose 3.6% in 2013, according to APTA figures and MTA officials.

WASHINGTON Americans took a record 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last year as an increase in urban living, costlier fuel, more investment and an economic upturn helped drive ridership, an industry group said on Monday.
2013 was the eighth straight year in which more than 10 billion trips were taken on U.S. public buses, subways, commuter rail and streetcars, the American Public Transportation Association(APTA) said in a report.
2013 marked the highest level of ridership since 1956, it said.
"It's all about, if you build it, they will come. The investment pays off," APTA President and Chief Executive Michael Melaniphy said in a telephone interview.
Melaniphy said the increase in part reflected increased investment in public transit by the federal government, along with that by states and cities which want to attract new businesses and workers.
The U.S. trend toward urban living and walkable cities also is behind the upturn in ridership. A surge in ridership that came in 2008 when gasoline and diesel prices spiked has continued even though the cost of fuel has fallen, Melaniphy said.
"People are coming and staying," he said. The upturn in the U.S. economy also means more people commuting to work.
Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent.
The increase has outpaced a 20.3 percent rise in population and a 22.7 percent upturn in vehicle miles traveled, the report said.
Among transport sectors, ridership for heavy rail, or subways and elevated trains, was up 2.8 percent last year. Commuter rail rose 2.1 percent.
Light rail, or streetcars and trolleys, experienced a 1.6 percent increase in ridership. Buses overall saw a 0.1 percent fall, though ridership in cities with less than 100,000 population rose almost 4 percent.
Cities with the largest increases in ridership included:
- Salt Lake City, which saw a 103.3 percent in commuter rail traffic after the opening of a new line in December 2012;
- Austin, Texas, with a 37.3 percent rise in commuter rail use;
- Miami, with an increase of almost 11 percent in heavy rail use, largely because of increased frequency during peak hours;
- and New Orleans, with a 29 percent rise in light rail use.
Release of the report coincided with the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, which is aimed at helping shape federal and industry policy.

Record Numbers on Public Transit
10.7 billion trips in U.S. for 2013
Email
New York City Subway    littleny/Thinkstock
Americans turned to public transport more in 2013 than any other year since 1956. Attributed to a recovering economy, growing transit systems, and more options, Americans made 10.7 billion trips on public transportation last year.
The rise in public transport has been pinned to the urban shift across the country, including many Americans' preference to live near transit lines. Sprawling cities such as Seattle, Miami, Denver, and San Diego saw major increases due to renewed focus on public transit systems . However, New York City, which accounts for one in three trips nationally, saw the biggest bump in 2013. 
 People are making a fundamental shift to having options,  explained Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the American Public Transportation Association.  This is a long-term trend. This isn t just a blip. 
New York City s system experienced an increase of more than  120 million trips in 2013 , a 3.6 percent increase from 2012.

Americans are riding the rails and buses in greater numbers than anytime since the beginning of the suburban sprawl in the 1950s.
A study by the American Public Transportation Association reports nearly 10.7 billion trips were taken last year, which is the highest number of trips since 1956.
The uptick is not confined to cities like New York and Washington, D.C., which have average high populations of ridership. Cities including Seattle, Denver and San Diego have also seen a huge gain as they expand their public transportation offerings.

U.S.: American Airlines got $425M for landing rights
Monday
Mar 10, 2014 at 12:01 AM Mar 10, 2014 at 1:13 PM
DALLAS (AP)- American Airlines is getting more than $425 million from selling takeoff and landing rights, or slots, at New York's LaGuardia Airport and Reagan National Airport outside Washington.
That price was disclosed Monday in comments filed in federal court in Washington by the U.S. Department of Justice.
The department said the value of those slots shows that it drove a hard bargain last year when it settled its antitrust lawsuit against the merger of American and US Airways. The airlines agreed to give up slots at LaGuardia and Reagan and gates at five other big airports.
The Justice Department filed its response Monday to public comments on the settlement. Consumer groups, lawmakers, the Detroit airport and Delta Air Lines Inc. lodged complaints about the settlement.
The Justice Department said that American's sale of the LaGuardia slots to Southwest Airlines Co. and Virgin America is complete, while the transfer of Reagan slots to Southwest, JetBlue Airways Corp. and Virgin America is expected to wrap up soon. Each airline had announced that it won bidding for the slots, but the sale prices were not disclosed.
Slots are controlled by the government at Reagan, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports in New York and Newark Liberty in Newark, N.J., making them valuable when they hit the market. A pair of slots is needed for each round-trip flight.
The government required American to give up rights for 52 round trips at Reagan National and 17 at LaGuardia, plus two airport gates each in Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Miami and Dallas.
The Justice Department said that after reviewing public comments, it still believes that the settlement will offset any lost competition from allowing the nation's third-biggest and fifth-biggest airlines to combine. The merger made American Airlines Group Inc. the world's biggest airline operator.
Some groups complained that the settlement didn't go far enough to protect consumers. Delta Air Lines Inc. argued that the government was wrong to say that so-called legacy carriers - United Airlines is another - shouldn't get any of the slots and gates that American is selling. Delta wants Reagan slots and gates at Dallas Love Field.
Federal law requires a 60-day public-comment period after the government settles an antitrust lawsuit. Even critics of the merger had low expectations that their complaints would change the outcome, however.

Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise - the highest total since 1956, according to ridership data reported by transit systems nationally and released Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.
Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.
"People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and CEO of the public transportation association. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."
Expanding bus and train networks help spur the growth.
Ridership on Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority light-rail trains increased six percent over 2012, as the public took advantage of an expanded network of lines. Overall, LA Metro gained nine million trips to reach 478 million in 2013, the transportation association said. Among the other transit systems in California with record ridership was the Caltrain commuter rail service that connects San Francisco with Silicon Valley.
Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large ridership gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.
Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.
"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."

5 ways to tell that spring's arrived in Fayetteville
Monday
Mar 10, 2014 at 12:01 AM Mar 10, 2014 at 12:59 PM
By Chick Jacobs
Winter has taken forever to give up its icy grip on the Cape Fear region. And there's no promise we won't see some more chilly days ahead. But there's no doubt: spring is on the way.
How can we be sure? Anyone can look for daffodils, but we have our own ways around here. Here are five can't-fail signs of spring in Fayetteville. Look or listen for them over the next week:
1. Birds at daybreak: You think Tippi Hedren had it tough in "The Birds?" Pity anyone who tries to sleep in late in Fayetteville. Like swallows to Capistrano, like Canadians to Myrtle Beach, when birds flock to Fayetteville, spring isn't far behind.
Robins in the grass, catbirds and mockingbirds calling at daybreak, woodpeckers hammering at our house siding, buzzards on the water towers ... it's a feathered testament to the changing season.
2. Plenty of pollen: You can't see it yet, but your nose knows. Pollen is already making an impression on allergies in the area.
Elm maple trees are just getting started, and the ubiquitous Bradford pears are on deck. In a couple of weeks, tissue and antihistamine will top our shopping lists.
3. Possums, possums everywhere: This is the time of year you're most likely to see (and unfortunately, flatten) a possum. The critters never truly hibernate, but when it begins warming up, they get hungry ... and very active. Spring evenings will find them scampering all over the region, including across busy streets at night. It's an unfortunate springtime rite of passage for Southern drivers.
4. A glut of gardeners: Hope springs eternal, and so do vegetable and flower gardens. Even though we're repeatedly warned not to plant until the danger of frost is past, which in Fayetteville means early April, give our gardeners a few sunny days and we're digging in the ground like California gold prospectors. Want proof? Just check the empty shelves at local garden centers after a sunny weekend.
5. Fluttering flags: Nothing reflects the rising and falling fortunes of spring than the flags flying from Fayetteville vehicles in early March. This week, you'll see bright blue (of both Duke and UNC hues), red and gold banners in support of an endless array of college basketball teams. This week, we wear our hearts on our sleeve and our colors on the car window.
But look quickly: By next week, after the ACC tournament is finished and Selection Sunday is complete, nearly all will be gone, dropping like the leaves of fall.

Public transportation at its highest level since 1956
by David Gura | Marketplace
A New York City MTA subway map.
Marketplace
Last year, Americans used public transportation to take 10.7 billion trips. According to the American Public Transportation Association , ridership hasn t been that high since 1956.
 It s truly a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities,  says Michael Melaniphy, the group s president and CEO, noting the growth started several years ago.
 Initially, when fuel prices spiked, it drove people to transit, and once they came, they decided it was good, and they stayed. 
There is a correlation, Melaniphy says, between high ridership and the health of the U.S. economy. Sixty percent of trips taken on public transit are work commutes.
However, Michael Moss, who directs the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, argues the other 40 percent is also important: 
 Mass transit today is not just a peak-hour activity,  he says. As public transportation becomes more popular, and as cities spend more money on expanding it, transit systems are opening earlier and closing later.
 There was a time when you said,  I want to live near a good school district,   Moss says.  Today, people want to live near a good transit connection. 
Moss is referring to young people especially, who are ever less likely to own cars.

Last year was a big one for public transportation: Americans took 10.7 billion trips in 2013, the highest level of public transit use since 1956, according to a report from the American Public Transportation Association.
The biggest gain nationwide between 2012 and 2013 was seen in heavy rail use (a 2.8 percent change), but this was not the case for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. Indeed, ridership on D.C.'s heavy rail system decreased by 2.65 percent. (From 280,904,200 in 2012 to 273,464,800 in 2013.) But bus ridership increased by 3.45 percent over the same time period. (From 130,236,700 in 2012 to 134,726,100 in 2013.)
Combined, the system saw a .72 percent decrease in ridership between 2012 and 2013, according to APTA's info.
In an oversight report to the D.C. Council, Metro put its rail ridership between January and December of 2013 at 245,913,697. Bus ridership was not provided.

What Makes A Good Ride-Sharing City?
Jessica Leber 03.10.14 10:45 AM
We ve recently covered the news that more people are foregoing car ownership than ever before, so it would make sense that public transit is becoming more and more popular at the same time. Now there s data to prove it.
The American Public Transportation Association s latest figures , released today, show that more Americans used public transit in 2013 than at any time in nearly 60 years. That amounts to a whopping 10.65 billion passenger trips, beating the previous record in 1956 and a more recent peak in 2008, when gas cost more than $4 a gallon and 10.59 million trips were taken.
This time around high gas prices aren t the main reason, and the trend is more about a basic shift in attitudes about how people travel in their cities, as well as a generally strong urban economy. Michael Melaniphy, president of the advocacy group, told the New York Times :
"Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers," Mr. Melaniphy said in an interview. "We re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities."
From 1995 to 2013, transit ridership rose 37 percent, well ahead of a 20 percent growth in population and a 23 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled, according to the association s data.
Cities should be paying attention, especially as many aim to attract young people to live and work in their borders. Young people traveling more often at "off-peak" times accounted for some of the increases seen over the last year, the New York Times reported .  Public transit agencies reporting the biggest ridership increases included those in smaller cities, such as Ann Arbor, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; Flagstaff, Arizona; and Riverside, California.
These are all reasons for cities to invest more in subways, buses, and rail systems though that is sure to raise the hackles of dedicated drivers. It may pay to note, however, more than 70% of transit tax efforts succeeded in the last two years, according to the association.

Report: Americans ride public transit in record numbers
Expanded networks, increased service, urban living and economic recovery account for boom in 2013

More Americans boarded public buses, trains and subways in 2013 than at any time since the suburbs began booming nearly 60 years ago, found a study  published Monday by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).
Nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013, to be precise   the highest total since 1956. While the number of national vehicle miles traveled on roads increased 0.3 percent, public transportation use in 2013 increased by 1.1 percent, according to the study.
 As the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,  Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of the Grand Rapids  transit authority in Michigan, said in a press release . 
 Public transportation systems nationwide   in small, medium, and large communities   saw ridership increases. Some reported all-time high ridership numbers. 
Expanding bus and train networks and increased service helped spur the growth, as did the nation's urban shift, the report found. Since 1995, public transit ridership has risen 37.2 percent, outpacing both population growth and the number of vehicle miles traveled on roads.
 There is a fundamental shift going on in the way we move about our communities,  said Michael Melaniphy, APTA president. "People are making a fundamental shift to having options" aside from a car in how they get around, he added. "This is a long-term trend. This isn't just a blip."
The economic recovery is another driver behind the increase in transit ridership. Nearly 60 percent of trips taken on public transportation in 2013 were for work commutes, the study found.
Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the Great Recession. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, the numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.
Heavy rail (subways and elevated trains) ridership saw the biggest jump with 2.8 percent nationally in 2013. Increased service during peak hours in Miami accounted for the bulk of the jump, increasing local usage by 10.6 percent. Commuter rails also became more popular as ridership increased 2.1 percent nationally. A new rail line in Salt Lake City, Utah, which opened in 2012, registered more than double the number of passengers compared to last year. Light rail systems, such as modern streetcars, trolleys and heritage trolleys, usage increased 1.6 percent, according to the study.
Nationally, bus ridership remained stable, declining by 0.1 percent. But in cities with a population of below 100,000, the number of passengers increased by 3.8 percent.
Demand-response ridership, a flexible mode of public transit that doesn t follow fixed routes or schedules, such as shared taxi or minibuses that pickup and deposit passengers along the way, increased by 0.5 percent in 2013.
Overall, the sprawling city of Houston had a large ridership gain. So did Los Angeles, Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area's behemoth transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.
Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation's urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.
"People want to work and live along transit lines," Melaniphy said. "Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors."

Promo image Bus Stop, 1956
Taking transit hasn't been so popular 1956, the year that Marilyn Monroe wowed in Bus Stop.
People are driving less , and some say we really are at peak car . So how are people getting around? It turns out a lot more people are taking transit, the most in 57 years. The American Public Transportation Association is jubilant:
"Last year people took 10.7 billion trips on public transportation. As the highest annual ridership number since 1956, Americans in growing numbers want to have more public transit services in their communities,  said Peter Varga, APTA Chair and CEO of The Rapid in Grand Rapids, MI.  Public transportation systems nationwide   in small, medium, and large communities   saw ridership increases. Some reported all-time high ridership numbers. 
The stats are pretty impressive:
Since 1995 public transit ridership is up 37.2 percent, outpacing population growth, which is up 20.3 percent, and vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which is up 22.7 percent.
Often people claim that the lousy economy makes people take cheaper transit rather than drive. The APTA claims the opposite:
Another reason behind the ridership increases is the economic recovery in certain areas. When more people are employed, public transportation ridership increases since nearly 60 percent of the trips taken on public transportation are for work commutes. 
Light Rail in Minneapolis/ wikipedia/ CC BY 2.0
Toronto opponents of light rail should note that the statistics here are pretty impressive. One can go on and on about how light rail has more stops that are closer together so that it can do a better (and cheaper) job of serving neighborhoods than subways can.
Light rail (modern streetcars, trolleys, and heritage trolleys) ridership increased 1.6 percent in 2013 with 17 out of 27 transit systems reporting increases. Systems that showed double digit increases in 2013 were located in the following cities: New Orleans, LA (28.9%); Denver, CO (14.9%); and San Diego, CA (10.4%). Ridership in the following cities also saw increases in 2013: Seattle, WA   Sound Transit (9.8%); Pittsburgh, PA (7.5%); Salt Lake City, UT (6.8%); Los Angeles, CA (6.0%); San Jose, CA (3.6%); and Philadelphia, PA (3.5%).

Public Transit Use In U.S. Is At a 57-Year High, Report Finds
CREDIT: AP PHOTO/NICK UT
More Americans used public transit last year than in any year since 1956, according to a new report by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA).
Americans took 10.7 billion trips on subways, streetcars, buses and other forms of public transportation in 2013, according to the report , making last year the eighth year in a row with more than 10 billion trips taken on public transportation. The report found that public transit ridership in the U.S. has jumped 37.2 percent since 1995, an increase that s outpaced population growth and vehicle miles traveled.
The last time public transit ridership was at an all-time high was 2008, when gas prices spiked in the U.S., reaching $4 and $5 per gallon in some places. In 2013, however, gas prices as a whole were lower , a fact the group says means that public transit isn t soley reliant on transportation costs.
 Now gas is averaging well under $4 a gallon, the economy is coming back and people are riding transit in record numbers,  Michael Melaniphy, president of APTA told the New York Times .  We re seeing a fundamental shift in how people are moving about their communities. 
The group said in a release that part of the reason for the spike in public transit usage was the economic recovery of some cities   with more people employed, there are more people relying on public transit to get to work every day. And, Melaniphy said, the inverse is true as well: cities that invest in public transit often see shrinking unemployment rates, because people have access to job opportunities that may have been off-limits before.
Americans aren t just taking public transit more often, however. They re also driving less, according to a 2013 report from the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The report found that the amount of miles driven per person has dropped in 46 states since 2007, with Washington, D.C. residents driving the least and young people across the country driving less than older generations.
If this trend of fewer miles driven and more miles spent on a bus or subway continues, it won t just be good for the environment   it ll also be good for Americans  health. Multiple studies have linked air pollution exposure to heart damage and birth defects , and exposure to traffic pollution in particular could be linked to kidney damage .

Americans are boarding public buses, trains and subways in greater numbers than any time in half a century.
They made nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013   the highest total since 1956, according to passenger data reported by transit systems nationally and released on Monday by the American Public Transportation Association.
Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the recession in the wake of the financial crisis. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase.
 People are making a fundamental shift to having options  aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association.  This is a long-term trend. 
Expanding bus and train networks help push the growth.
Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large passenger gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area s huge transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally.
Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs.
 People want to work and live along transit lines,  Melaniphy said.  Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.

Could the Flight MH370 Rescue Bring China and Japan Closer Together?
If Japan had volunteered to join the search for Flight 370, could that help thaw tensions between Tokyo and Beijing?
By Jin Kai for The Diplomat
March 11, 2014
 
 
For China and Chinese leaders, the past week was not an easy one. The terrorist attack in Kunming left at least 29 dead and more than 130 wounded. Now, the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 inevitably has made the situation more anxious.
As hours turn into days, a multinational rescue team has started searching for the missing plane. According to China Daily (Chinese), as of March 9, 11 countries have joined in an international search and rescue operation after this flight mysteriously disappeared from radar. China Daily says vessels and aircraft in this international rescue operation come from China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Britain. The 239 people on board, including 227 passengers, are from 11 different countries, according to a Malaysia Airlines press briefing. 154 of the missing passengers are Chinese, including one from Taiwan. There are no citizens from Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines, aboard the missing plane, but all four countries are close to the incident site and have joined the search efforts. Other countries, such as Britain, participated in the search for MH370 despite not having any citizens involved and a large geographical distance.
There are no Japanese citizens on MH370, and given the current situation on East China Sea, Japan certainly has no obligation to join the rescue. However, Japan has the most advanced technology and facility in Asia-Pacific region, highly trained rescue personnel, and extensive experiences in disaster management. So what if Japan had volunteered to join the MH370 international rescue operation?

China has been closely watching Japan s overseas operations. If a Japanese civilian rescue team participated in the search, would Beijing  regard it as at least a positive and friendly gesture in the enduring Sino-Japanese standoff? Such a gesture might just help to promote bilateral dialogues and ease the tensions that have been created by historical and territorial disputes. Both China and Japan did enjoy a symbolic friendship when then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Japan s earthquake-hit area on May 21, 2011  to convey the Chinese people s sympathies for the local people and to demonstrate China s support for Japan s reconstruction efforts.  However, the Sino-Japanese relationship hit the rocks again in 2012 after this period of brief amity.
The Sino-Japanese bilateral relationship has reached a deadlock and there seems to be no panacea for this conundrum in the near future. Under these circumstances, more indirect approaches might help to make some changes, if not outright diplomatic achievements. Such indirect actions could simply serve to send intended messages, especially at a time when high-level inter-governmental channels have basically failed. One such notable case, reported by media from both countries , took place in mid-November 2013, when the Japanese government recognized a Chinese student for saving a Japanese boy from drowning.
Unfortunately, that moment was just a flash in the pan, and reconciliation between these two neighbors is still nowhere to be seen. According to Xinhua (Chinese), on February 28, Japan s Foreign Ministry held a meeting with Japan s 30 ambassadors to Asia-Pacific countries such as China, South Korea, and Australia. The Foreign Ministry urged the ambassadors to  defeat the opposite side [China] by substantially utilizing their personal charm and hit hard on those governments.  Obviously, Japan s Foreign Ministry intends to fight back against China s previous round of public diplomacy in global media.
However, a spiraling escalation of confrontation ultimately is not what can help to solve territorial disputes, especially between China and Japan, both of which are giant economies with growing military capability. At this moment when war preparations seem to appear in both countries, it is critically urgent to find all possible opportunities to take a step back and to give each country a way out. It may not be another award for a notable deed, but could be something more emotionally and intuitively acceptable and thus helpful to ease the bilateral confrontation. Both China and Japan should find or create these opportunities.

Crude drops on soft Chinese trade figures
March 10, 2014, 01:53:55 PM EDT By Investing.com

Investing.com -
Investing.com - Crude prices took a dive on Monday after poor Chinese trade figures spooked investors with fears emerging-market economies are cooling and will consume less fuel and energy.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in April traded at $101.21 a barrel during U.S. trading, down 1.34%. New York-traded oil futures hit a session low of $100.86 a barrel and a high of $102.73 a barrel.
The April contract settled up 1.00% at $102.58 a barrel on Friday.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $100.17 a barrel, Thursday's low, and resistance at $102.89 a barrel, Friday's high.
Weak Chinese trade data bruised oil prices on Monday.
Data released over the weekend revealed that Chinese exports fell 18.1% on-year in February, defying expectations for a 6.8% increase, following a rise of 10.6% in January.
A separate report showed that the annual rate of inflation in China slowed to 2.0% in February, from 2.5% in January.
The numbers confirmed market fears that emerging markets are cooling.
China is the world's second-largest consumer of crude oil.
Cushioning losses, however, were ongoing geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya, which could threaten global supply if escalated.
Friday's better-than-expected U.S. jobs report offset losses as well by boosting hopes demand will pick up in the world's largest consumer of oil.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, beating expectations for a 149,000 increase.
January's figure was revised up to 129,000 from 113,000.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for April delivery were down 0.90% and trading at US$107.49 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at US$6.28 a barrel.

US oil plastered by weak Chinese export data, ends near $101
Monday, 10 Mar 2014 |  2:38  PM ET
Reuters
SHARES
U.S. oil fell by more than $1 per barrel on Monday, pressured by an unexpected fall in China's exports that stoked fears of a slowdown in the world's second largest economy.
Moderating temperatures that will cut the need for heating fuels also weighed on U.S. oil prices. U.S. ultra low-sulfur diesel futures, more commonly known as heating oil, were down 1.5 percent.
Oil on both sides of the Atlantic was pressured as traders unwound some of the risk premium associated with fears of an escalation in tensions in Crimea over the weekend. The crisis in Ukraine had pushed money managers to collect a record number of bullish bets in U.S. oil futures and options last week, U.S. government data showed on Friday.

After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading 50 lower near $108. U.S oil fell $1.46 to settle at $101.12 per barrel, after touching a session high at $102.82.
U.S. oil's discount to the global benchmark has narrowed by as much as $9 since the beginning of the year as TransCanada's Gulf Coast pipeline has funneled oil from Cushing to the Gulf Coast.
With heating season coming to an end and refiners in maintenance season, traders and analysts expect that oil leaving Cushing will simply pool along the coast, forcing a temporary a glut and capping prices until stocks are drawn down to make gasoline for summer driving season. Oil stocks in the Gulf Coast have risen every week over the last 1.5 months.

WTI crude falls sharply as China trade data weighs
March 10, 2014, 11:36:21 AM EDT By Investing.com

Investing.com -
Investing.com - Crude oil prices lost more than 1% on Monday, as growing concerns over the health of China's economy dampened demand for riskier assets.
The Asian nation is the world's second largest oil consumer after the U.S. and has been the engine of strengthening demand.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in April fell to a session low of $100.86 a barrel, the lowest since March 6.
WTI crude prices last traded at $101.13 a barrel during U.S. morning hours, down 1.4%, or $1.45. The April contract rose 1%, or $1.02 a barrel, on Friday to settle at $102.58.
Nymex oil futures were likely to find support at $100.13 a barrel, the low from March 6 and resistance at $102.91 a barrel, the high from March 7.
Elsewhere, on the ICE Futures Exchange in London, Brent oil futures for April delivery slumped 1.05%, or $1.16, to trade at $107.84 a barrel, while the spread between the Brent and U.S. crude contracts stood at $6.71 a barrel.
Data released over the weekend showed that Chinese exports collapsed 18.1% in February from a year earlier, disappointing expectations for a 6.8% increase.
Imports rose 10.1%, compared to forecasts for an 8% increase. According to customs data, China's February crude oil imports totaled 23.05 million metric tons, down 18.1% from January.
The significant decline in China's exports led to a deficit of $22.98 billion last month, compared to a surplus of $31.86 billion in January. Analysts had expected a surplus of $14.5 billion in February.
A separate report showed that consumer price inflation in China rose 2% in February from a year earlier, in line with expectations, while producer price inflation declined 2%, compared to forecasts for a 1.9% drop.
The data added to fears over a slowdown in the world's second largest economy, and overshadowed last Friday's stronger-than-forecast U.S. jobs report for February.
The U.S. economy added 175,000 jobs in February, the Labor Department reported, well above expectations for 149,000 new jobs.

Asian shares slip after weak China, Japan data
March 10 2014 07:57 PM
A
A
Pedestrians walk past an electronic board displaying stock prices in  Tokyo. Japan s Nikkei share average yesterday slipped 153.93 points to  15,120.14 on weak trade data.
AFP/Tokyo
Asian markets tumbled yesterday following a surprisingly poor batch of economic data out of China, while revised Japanese figures showed 2013 growth was slower than expected.
The losses came after healthy gains on most bourses last week and despite jobs growth in the US, while investors are keeping an eye on events in Ukraine as leaders try to find a peaceful resolution to the crisis.
Tokyo slipped 1.01%, or 153.93 points, to 15,120.14, Sydney fell 0.93%, or 50.8 points, to 5,411.5 and Seoul was 1.03% lower, giving up 20.26 points, to end at 1,954.42.  Shanghai dived 2.86%, or 58.84 points, to 1,999.07 while Hong Kong sank 1.75%, or 395.56 points, to 22,264.93.
Beijing said on Saturday it had seen an unexpected trade deficit of $22.98bn in February.  The figure compared with a surplus of $14.8bn in the same month last year, and a median forecast of an $11.9bn surplus. Exports fell 18.1% and imports jumped 10.1%.
 It s hard to ignore a number that looks like that,  said Sean Callow, senior currency strategist at Westpac Institutional Bank in Sydney.  Those figures were followed the next day by news that inflation eased to 2% in February, down from 2.5% in January, leading to talk of possible deflation, which could delay much-needed investment and consumer spending.
While authorities blame the country s holiday season for the weak results, they add to growing worries about the Chinese economy, with the latest surveys on its key manufacturing sector showing weakness. The sell-off yesterday is  symptomatic of the mood of the market to be spooked by any poor China numbers and to only take moderate comfort from strong numbers , he told Dow Jones Newswires.
In Japan the government said yesterday that gross domestic product growth was 0.2% in the quarter to December and 1.5% through 2013, slower than first thought.  Preliminary figures last month showed GDP expanded 0.3% in October-December period and 1.6% over the year.
While the data still marked Japan s best annual performance in three years, it will put the focus on the central bank as it begins a policy meeting later in the day, with speculation that it will announce a fresh batch of monetary easing measures.
In currency trade the yen rose after seeing a sell-off for most of last week. In the afternoon the dollar fell to 103.15 yen from 103.24 yen in New York on Friday.
The euro fetched $1.3886 and 143.23 yen, against $1.3874 and 143.31 yen.
In Kuala Lumpur flag-carrier Malaysia Airlines lost 20% at one point after one of its 777 airliners went missing at the weekend with 239 people aboard, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. However, it clawed back a substantial part of that to sit 4% lower in late trade.
The broader market was down 0.50%.
Oil prices fell. New York s main contract, West Texas Intermediate for April delivery, was down 13 cents at $102.45 and Brent North Sea crude for April fell 82 cents to $108.18.  Gold fetched $1,339.80 an ounce at 1200 GMT compared with $1,348.20 late Friday.
In other markets, Singapore closed down 0.31%, or 9.63 points, at 3,126.63, Bangkok edged down 0.44% or 6.03 points to close at 1,349.05, Jakarta ended down 0.18%, or 8.64 points, at 4,677.25, Kuala Lumpur dipped 0.56%, or 10.20 points, to 1,822.06, Taipei fell 0.56%, or 48.72 points, to 8,665.24, Wellington eased 0.15%, or 7.82 points, to 5,117.84 and Manila ended flat, edging up 5.40 points to 6,487.23.

No 'Hard Evidence'? No Problem (Seeking Alpha)
Brent crude oil fell below $109 to start the week on poor data from China, but supply worries helped underpin prices. The commodity traded at $108.01 at 6:00 GMT on Monday morning, as investors evaluated geopolitical tension in both Ukraine and Libya.
Bloomberg reported that China released data on Monday showing that the nation's exports unexpectedly fell 18.1 percent in February from a year earlier. The figure was far below economists' expectations of a 7.5 percent increase, though some are blaming the country's Lunar New Year holiday for the disparity. The data compounded the already growing worry that the Chinese economy is slowing down as it followed poor PMI data released last week.
However, the ongoing tension in Ukraine kept a floor under Brent prices as Russian forces tightened their grip on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula over the weekend. Russian forces seized another border post as well as a military airfield over the weekend as pro-Russian leaders moved forward with the country's planned referendum.
Related: Euro Holds On To Strength
Western leaders have said they will not recognize Crimea's independence from Ukraine if the vote does take place on March 16, as it is a direct violation of Ukraine's treaty and international law.
However, the Ukrainian government has more pressing problems as its unpaid bills could leave the country without gas. Gazprom has said it may stop sending gas to Ukraine unless the government is able to pay its debts.
Tension in Libya also supported Brent prices as armed protesters clashed with the nation's government on Sunday over the sale of oil from a rebel held port. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan warned protesters that the military would bomb a North Korean tanker, which was loaded with $36 million of crude oil if it leaves the county's Es Sider port.

Why Oil Keeps Biting Bears
By Robert Rapier on March 10, 2014

Privacy Policy
Introduction
In last week s issue of The Energy Letter , I discussed my January prediction that the average natural gas price in the US would be higher this year than last year. While that prediction is looking pretty safe because of the extremely cold winter, I also predicted that  Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices will average less in 2014 than in 2013.  Let s see how that one is faring.
I also predicted lower oil prices for 2013, and ended up being only partially right. In 2013 the average price of Brent crude was 2.8 percent lower than in 2012 with an average of $108.56/barrel (bbl). West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was up 4 percent in 2013 to an average daily price of $97.98/bbl. So in 2013 I was right on the direction of Brent, and wrong on the direction of WTI. (I also predicted that the differential between the two would decline, which it did).
As I write this, the price of WTI has so far averaged $97.75 this year (only three cents lower than last year s average), while the price of Brent has averaged $108.55 (a penny below last year s average). At this point this year s average is nearly identical to last year s average. But with WTI presently trading at $102.55 and Brent at $109 it won t take long for average prices to rise above my prediction.
The Argument for Lower Prices
Given the rapid expansion of oil production in the US, it is certainly possible that local supplies could temporarily outstrip demand in the short term, or that temporary logistical constraints could develop. Either of these factors would favor lower short-term WTI pricing. In fact, this is reflected somewhat in the price differential between WTI and Brent.
Until 2010 WTI generally traded at a slight premium to Brent, but the rapid rise in oil production in the US and the logistical constraints in getting that oil to market have had it trading at a discount since. That discount has at times exceeded $20/bbl, which has been very fortunate for oil refiners.
While there is still a federal ban in place on crude oil exports, refiners can export finished products. These finished products   fuels like gasoline and diesel   are generally priced based on Brent. So refiners can buy crude at WTI prices and sell finished products at Brent prices. A general rule of thumb I use is that when the Brent-WTI spread is over $10/bbl, quarterly results for refiners will be pretty good. If the spread is $20, results will be fantastic.
So even though growing US production is reflected in the WTI discount, the price of oil is still hovering around $100/bbl despite many predictions that prices would soften. In fact, a year ago analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch suggested oil could fall to $50/bbl within two years, and Ed Morse at Citi expects crude prices to average $80/bbl through 2020. At the other end of the spectrum Oswald Clint at Sanford Bernstein projects nearly double that price at $158 a barrel in 2020.
Demand Keeps Pace
Why have oil prices remained so stubbornly high, despite huge increases in US oil production? In a nutshell, it s the demand side of the equation keeping pace with the growing supply. Over the past decade, demand in the US and the EU fell, but this was more than compensated for by growing demand in developing countries. This kept the price of oil high, despite supply/demand fundamentals that in isolated countries would have encouraged lower prices.
But the world s oil markets aren t local. And now demand in the US is starting to regain strength, recently rising to the highest level since 2008. The International Energy Agency has estimated that global demand for oil will increase this year by 1.2 million barrels a day. For perspective, over the past five years the world has increased oil production by nearly 3.9 million barrels (2 million of which was from the US)   an average increase each year of 770,000 barrels per year.
So the increase in oil production has been gobbled up by an energy hungry world just as fast as crude could come out of the ground, and that trend is likely to continue long-term. Nevertheless, the easing of sanctions on Iran, the continued growth of oil production in Iraq, and another year of expansion for the US oil industry could combine to oversupply the market in the short term. This may be offset, however, by deteriorating events in Venezuela and Libya .
Conclusions
For now, investors in natural gas companies can be happy that my natural gas prediction is proving to be correct, but investors in oil companies can also be happy that my prediction for lower oil prices hasn t yet materialized.
In any event, I believe the long-term direction for both commodities is inevitably higher prices, so while I still expect a sideways to slightly negative direction for oil prices over the next couple of years, over the long haul this sector will continue to deliver.

Crude oil futures slump after underwhelming Chinese export data
March 10, 2014
by Editorial Team
Underwhelming export data released by the globe's second largest consumer prompted Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures to lose value on Monday, marking the first trading session of losses on three days for the energy commodity, according to Bloomberg.
International exports from China fell by more than 18 percent last month as compared with the same period last year, according to the General Administration of Customs. That represents the sharpest losses since August 2009.
"Today's stats have undermined the prices of commodities dependent on Chinese demand," senior broker Christopher Bellew with Jefferies Bache Ltd. in London told the news source on Monday. "Still, the statistics that come from emerging markets tend to be a bit bumpy, with quite big swings, and the picture is still for higher growth than in mature economies."
At 9:38 a.m. on Monday, WTI crude oil futures fell 1.54 percent, a $1.58 loss to $101 per barrel. At 9:39 a.m., Brent crude oil futures slumped 1.07 percent, a $1.17 dip to $107.83 per barrel.
The Wall Street Journal reports the Chinese losses represent a sizable concern about prospects for demand of the energy commodity.

Oil falls below $108 on China data, supply concerns limit decline
FULL COVERAGE:
By Lin Noueihed | LONDON
LONDON Oil slipped below $108 a barrel on Monday as an unexpected fall in China's exports stoked fears of a slowdown in the world's No. 2 economy, though geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and Libya limited the decline.
The drop in exports increased concerns over growth in oil demand as it followed a series of disappointing factory surveys since the start of 2014. Price gains in recent weeks on tensions in Ukraine mean oil is seeing a steeper correction.
Most risk assets, including Asian shares and base metals, also fell due to the weak numbers.
After two straight days of gains, Brent crude was trading $1.05 down at $107.95 by 1400 GMT, having fallen $1.25 earlier in the session. U.S. oil fell $1.42 to $101.16 a barrel after touching a high of $102.82.
"We've seen some disappointing data from China ... But I think people get a bit over-pessimistic about these numbers when the overall picture is still quite good. The falls will be limited," said Christopher Bellew, trader at Jefferies Bache.
"There has been no sign of deterioration in Ukraine. At the end of last week there was a rally that priced in an unexpected event at the weekend and that hasn't happened."
MARKET OUTLOOK
Russian forces consolidated their hold on Ukraine's Crimea peninsula on Monday, taking over a military hospital and a missile base as officials geared up for a referendum on the region's future.
Gazprom (GAZP.MM) warned on Friday it could stop shipping gas to Ukraine over unpaid bills, increasing pressure on the new government in Kiev and its supporters in Europe.
"We will continue to see some back and forth between Russia and the West over Ukraine," said Victor Shum, vice-president of energy consultancy IHS Energy Insight. "The ongoing situation in Ukraine will put a high floor on oil prices and lead to more volatility."
Hedge funds and other large speculators last week raised their bets on a rise in Brent to the highest level since October, the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE) said, highlighting the effect of Ukraine tensions on sentiment.
Money managers increased their crude net long positions by 6,864 contracts to 146,785 in the week to March 4.
Oil is also being supported by a crisis in Libya. Libya threatened to bomb a North Korean-flagged tanker if it tried to ship oil from a rebel-controlled port, in a major standoff. Rebels said they were moving land and sea forces to confront any government attack.
At the same time, Libya's National Oil Company said production had restarted at the El Sharara field which feeds export terminals in the west and would reach capacity on Tuesday afternoon.
Combined Chinese exports in January and February fell 1.6 percent from the same period a year earlier. That raised concerns that the data was not weak due to distortions caused by the Lunar New Year holiday, which began on January 31 and covered early February.
Prices were under pressure even though China's crude oil imports in the first two months of the year rose 11.5 percent from a year earlier, as investors saw the rise partly as a result of a build-up in commercial crude inventories.

Elephants Can Tell Human Voices Apart
Mar 10, 2014 04:19 PM EDT    | Jordan Ecarma

Researchers have discovered that African elephants can distinguish different people groups and gauge whether or not the humans are dangerous just from hearing them talk.
Working with around 1,500 elephants roaming Kenya's Amboseli National Park, the researchers found that elephants can tell if a human voice is male or female and if it belongs to a child or an adult, USA TODAY reported.
"They're using vocal information from another species--us--and they're using that to discern a threat," said study co-author Graeme Shannon, a behavioral ecologist at Britain's University of Sussex, as quoted by USA TODAY. "That takes really advanced cognitive abilities. ... These are subtle differences these elephants are attending to."
The elephants used in the study live near two groups of people: the Maasi, who used to spear elephants frequently and now attack the animals on occasion, and the Kamba, peaceful farmers who aren't a threat.
To test whether the elephants could tell the different ethnic groups apart, the scientists disguised loudspeakers with palm leaves and put them near a herd. The speakers played a human voice saying, "Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming," and the elephants reacted in different ways depending on the voice.
The recording of a Masaai man put the elephants on alert; they bunched together and smelled the air, waiting for a possible attack. But they had little reaction to a Kamba man or women and children from either people group, who didn't historically pose a threat.
The scientists then further tested the animals' ability to distinguish voices by toying with the recording of a Masaai man's voice to sound higher and more like a woman's. The elephants still reacted as if the voice hadn't been altered, which implies that "they are picking up gender signals more accurate than those used by humans," USA TODAY reported.

Elephants Hear Age, Gender, Ethnicity in Human Voices
Posted Mon, 03/10/2014
To most people, elephants sound the same. Unless, you re very experienced, it would be hard to tell the difference between two elephants based solely on their voices. They, however, have no such problems with us.
Karen McComb and Graeme Shannon from the University of Sussex have now shown that wild African elephants can tell the difference between the voices of humans from two ethnic groups, and react accordingly. They can even discriminate between the sounds of men and women, and adults and boys.
This ability matters because, to an elephant, not all humans are equal. They have no quarrel with the agriculturalist Kamba. But they often come into conflict with the cattle-herding Maasai over access to water or land, and they sometimes leave these clashes with a flank full of spears.
Back in 2009, Lucy Bates and Richard Byrne from the University of St Andrews showed that elephants at Kenya s Amboseli National Park can distinguish between the smell of Maasai and Kamba clothes . If they sniffed eau de Maasai, they were more likely to flee into long grass. They behaved in the same way if they saw the distinctive red colour of Maasai clothes. McComb and Shannon s study is a sequel of sorts. They showed that elephants can rely on sounds as well as smells to assess the threats they face.
The team recorded 20 Maasai and 15 Kamba saying  Look, look over there, a group of elephants is coming  in their respective languages. They then played these recordings to 48 family groups of Amboseli elephants. The herds obviously couldn t understand the meaning of the words, but they could tell the difference between the two languages. When they heard the Massai voices, they were much more likely to bunch up into defensive clusters and sniff the air with their trunks. They knew which group was more dangerous.
They also seemed to know which people within the groups pose the greatest threat: they behaved defensively when they heard Maasai men rather than women, and adults rather than boys.  I don t find this at all surprising, since voice pitch alone enables that distinction,  says Byrne.  But the details that differ between Maasai and Kamba languages are presumably more subtle. 
But when McComb and Shannon altered the Maasai recordings so that the male and female voices had the same pitch, the elephants could still tell them apart. They must have been picking up on some features that are subtler than mere frequency.
Still, that s not surprising. Elephants are big-brained and extremely intelligent. They communicate with a wide range of sounds. They are long-lived, so they can build up a substantial lifetime of experience, and they live in tightly knit social groups, so youngsters can benefit from the knowledge of their elders.  The surprising thing was just how clued up they were,  says McComb.  They were really able to make these distinctions very well and they rarely got it wrong. 
They can also tailor their responses to different predators. Their main threats are humans and lions. In an earlier study, McComb and Shannon found that elephants can tell the difference between the roars of male and female lions . They react to these roars by forming defensive circles and then noisily mobbing the source of the sound. (Watch them react below.)
But when they heard the Maasai voices, they were much less aggressive.  Coming towards humans with spears would be very detrimental,  McComb deadpans.  They behaved as if they were expecting to see Maasai.  They also went into stealth mode; they only made audible noises 10 percent of the time after hearing Maasai speech, compared to 67 percent after hearing lion roars.
In a related study, Joseph Soltis , who works at Disney s Animal Kingdom, found that elephants react differently to two distinct threats: talking humans and buzzing bees. Bees can sting elephants in vulnerable places like their eyes or inside their trunks, and elephants are so scared of this that they ll flee if they hear buzzing.
Soltis  team showed that Kenyan herds make distinct alarm calls when they hear either humans or bees, and they can modify the tempo and pitch of the calls to show how urgent the threats are. They also react accordingly. When the researchers played the calls back to the elephants, they found that both alarms would prompt the herds to keep watch and run away. But the bee alarm specifically makes them shake their heads, presumably to knock away any nearby stings.
These studies are testament to the keen intelligence, rich social lives, and sophisticated communications of these largest of land animals. As Ferris Jabr beautifully writes ,  To look an elephant in the face is to gaze upon genius. 
But the results also speak to the sad history of conflicts between humans and elephants . These conflicts must have played out many times over for the animals to build up enough experience about which humans are the most dangerous.
 The level of spearing has gone down quite considerably in recent years,  says McComb. The Maasai are now partners in Amboseli National Park. They also get compensated if elephants accidentally kill their livestock, which stops them from spearing the animals in retaliation. Still, the sound of Maasai still sets them on edge. This suggests that once at least some members of the family have a bad run-in with humans, the others learn from her and the fear stays in the group.
Still, McComb adds that  elephants are very good at living alongside humans by avoiding dangerous situations. But when we start doing something dramatically different, like a huge increase in poaching or using automatic weapons, they can t adapt fast enough. That s when we need to step in and protect them. 
Fritz Vollrath from Oxford University, who was involved in the bee study, adds,  Knowing how elephants perceive their social and physical environments and how the communicate their perceptions between one another will allow us to not only better understand them but also to better protect them in the wild.

Following the Japan Filing, Now Mt. Gox Files For Bankruptcy Protection in the U.S.
March 10, 2014
Amanda Marie
First noticed on Saturday, visitors to the Mt. Gox website were greeted with a spam warning letter . The warning cautions everyone about spam emails looking like they are from Mt. Gox in an attempt at phishing. Mt. Gox indicates that they never request personal information by email, and is advising everyone not to respond to any type of email asking for their personal information.
Following that, late on Sunday, troubled Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S., which follows a previous filing in Japan in February for bankruptcy protection. The filing is under Chapter 15, which is defined as,  Chapter 15 is a new chapter added to the Bankruptcy Code by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. It is the U.S. domestic adoption of the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency promulgated by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ("UNCITRAL") in 1997, and it replaces section 304 of the Bankruptcy Code. Because of the UNCITRAL source for chapter 15, the U.S. interpretation must be coordinated with the interpretation given by other countries that have adopted it as internal law to promote a uniform and coordinated legal regime for cross-border insolvency cases.   This filing covers all of the interests involved in more than one country.
In the court documents filed in Federal Court in Dallas, dated March 10, 2014, CEO Mark Karpeles noted that company has approximately $63.9 million in liabilities and approximately $37.7 million in assets at present. He also states that Mt. Gox has no secured debt and that approximately 12 percent of the equity in Mt. Gox is held by the developer of the initial Mt. Gox software, Jed MacCaleb, with the remaining equity held by Tibbanne Co. Ltd, aka Tibanne KK, a Japanese corporation located in Japan. Karpeles also stated that the business challenges they faced were substantial denial of service attacks which forced them to shut down several times, and which ultimately led to the theft of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins owned by Mt. Gox customers and Mt. Gox itself. Those circumstances resulted in a total halt of all withdrawals on February 7, 2014.
Karpeles declaration asks for the court s assistance to  allow MtGox the breathing room necessary to address technical defects in its processing software, investigate the theft of bitcoins through its exchange, and confirm a rehabilitation plan. 
While the future of Mt. Gox remains very questionable, the Bitcoin community as a whole is moving on unfazed by all the recent headlines. The losses at Mt. Gox, Flexcoin and elsewhere didn't seem to change prices as much as one would have expected, they've remained in a somewhat steady range between $500 and $700. Many critics, however, still remain skeptical as to what the future holds for the cryptocurrency because bitcoin isn't tied to any regulatory bank or government policies, which makes it more susceptible to fraud and abuse, and is an excellent way for criminals to launder their money.

Mt. Gox Rumored To Have Pocketed Bitcoins Reported As Stolen
by editor
Enid Burns for redOrbit.com - Your Universe Online
Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox continues to suffer damages, but the most recent accusations after the company claimed $400 million worth of the currency was lost last month may this time be self-inflicted. Hackers claim to have accessed the company's records and say Mt. Gox may have actually pocketed the cash and show other evidence of fraud.
Mt. Gox described last month's activity as a massive hacker attack, blaming the hackers for the theft of hundreds of millions of dollars  worth of bitcoins from user accounts. The theft alone bankrupted the company. Forbes reports that on Sunday hackers alleged that at least some of the bitcoins reportedly stolen last month were actually kept by the company, and not stolen.
"On Sunday, hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox s CEO, to post an angry screed alleging that the exchange he ran had actually kept at least some of the bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from users. 'It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,' wrote the unidentified hackers, referring to the multiple occasions over its three year history when Mt. Gox has gone offline, delayed trades or suspended withdrawals, events so common that Bitcoin users coined the phrase to be 'goxed' to suffer from Mt. Gox s technical glitches," Forbes' Andy Greenberg wrote.
Hackers supplied some evidence with their accusations. The post on Karpeles' personal website contained a 716 megabyte file that the hackers claimed comprised stolen data from Mt. Gox's servers. The file includes an Excel spreadsheet that details over a million trades, "a file that purports to show the company s balances in eighteen difference currencies, the backoffice application for some sort of administrative access to the databases of Mt. Gox s parent company Tibanne Limited, a screenshot of the hackers  access to those databases, a list of Mark Karpeles  home addresses and Karpeles  personal CV," Forbes reports.
It is not advisable to actually access the files posted by the hackers. Forbes updated its report to say that users on Reddit warn that the files "may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins." Other users on Reddit confirmed that the data are not fake as they found details of their own account history in the files.
The hackers claim that a balance of 951,116 bitcoins in Mt. Gox's balance is a portion of what Karpeles claims was lost to hackers from user accounts.
The hacking and posting of Mt. Gox information apparently occurred after frustration of Mt. Gox's silence after bitcoin currency in user accounts was stolen last month when a vulnerability was exploited. One company, AU10TIX , found that the crash occurred due to inadequate ID authentication practices.
One vocal victim of the theft last month was the black market site Silk Road , which claims to have lost 4,400 bitcoins worth roughly $2.6 million.

Fallout from collapse of Japanese bitcoin exchange prompts bankruptcy filing
Hamilton Spectator
DALLAS The Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange that recently collapsed in Japan has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States to shield itself from a lawsuit seeking to repay thousands of people whose digital currency is now missing.
The U.S. filing made in Dallas late Sunday supplements a bankruptcy petition that Mt. Gox submitted in Japan at the end of last month.
Mt. Gox was once the world's largest exchange specializing in bitcoins, but now finds itself in a financial mess after losing about 850,000 bitcoins valued at $473 million US, according to court documents.
Although it's based in Tokyo, Mt. Gox is opening a bankruptcy case in the U.S. in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in Illinois on behalf of all U.S. residents burned by the exchange's abrupt demise.

Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox files US bankruptcy amid fraud allegations

Mt. Gox, once the world s largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.
Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers  bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox s U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox s assets. Mt. Gox s founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.
The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.
 This case involves a massive fraud,  said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale.  They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honor, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse. 
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.
 We don t have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles,  said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.
Mt. Gox s attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.
Hale s order protects Mt. Gox s U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.
Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on February 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.
Mt Gox s tangled web of shell corporations brings turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies  owners.
The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company s true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies  activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.
Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means  worthless little symbol  in Latin) but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.
It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Delaware and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.
Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries, since he speaks French.
When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox s bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.
He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.
Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.
The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Sen. Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.
The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver s license or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.
The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

Mt Gox files US bankruptcy

GOLDMINE: Mark Karpeles, chief executive of Mt Gox, attends a news conference at the Tokyo District Court.

Bitcoin exchange files for bankruptcy
March 11, 201410:20am
Mt Gox has filed for bankruptcy with $473 million missing.
AAPAAP
Email a friend
THE collapse of Japan's Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange is spilling into U.S. bankruptcy court as the company scrambles for legal cover after losing digital currency valued at $473 million.
Mt. Gox's bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday supplements a similar petition made in Japan late last month following the exchange's abrupt closure. The U.S. case is being brought under Chapter 15 of the country's bankruptcy code, which provides a haven for foreign companies seeking to reorganise their finances.
Mt. Gox's downfall provided fresh ammunition for bitcoin sceptics who have questioned the security and staying power of a digital currency created six years ago as an alternative to government-controlled monetary systems that rely on banks to process most transactions.
Once the world's largest exchange specialising in bitcoins, Mt. Gox is now mired in a financial mess. The exchange froze its users' accounts last month and then shut down after acknowledging it couldn't account for 850,000 bitcoins. Mt. Gox CEO Robert Karpeles blamed most of the losses on computer hackers who took advantage of the exchange's flawed software.

The missing currency, valued at $473 million at the time of Mt. Gox's Feb. 28 bankruptcy filing in Japan, represents about 7 per cent of all bitcoins in worldwide circulation, according to court documents.
Although it's based in Tokyo, Mt. Gox is opening a U.S. bankruptcy case in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in the state of Illinois on behalf of all U.S. residents burned by the exchange's demise.
The civil complaint brought against Mt. Gox by Illinois resident Gregory Greene alleges the exchange engaged in fraud and other misconduct. The suit is seeking to be certified as a class action that would represent all U.S. residents who had paid fees to Mt. Gox as part of a bitcoin trade or had their accounts frozen.

Steven Woodrow, a Denver attorney representing Greene, estimates hundreds of thousands of people could be represented in the case. In a Monday interview, Woodrow said he still intends to seek a federal court order that would freeze Mt. Gox's computers and other assets in the U. S. A hearing on Woodrow's request for the court order is scheduled for Tuesday in Chicago.
If the Illinois case proceeds, Mt. Gox attorneys contend that it will drain the company's finances and divert management's attention during a critical time.
Mt. Gox's bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $64 million and assets of $38 million.
Mt. Gox also is hoping to use U.S. bankruptcy laws to ward off another lawsuit filed last year in a Seattle federal court by a former U.S. partner, CoinLab Action.
Under an agreement signed in November 2012, CoinLab was supposed to use Mt. Gox's technology to run a bitcoin exchange in the U.S. and Canada. The alliance unravelled within a few months, prompting CoinLab to sue Mt. Gox for alleged breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking $75 million in damages, according to court documents.

Former Macquarie banker Joe Lee and Wall Street investment adviser George Samman suspected something was wrong with Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox in the closing months of 2013.
The founders behind Singapore-based derivatives trader BTC.sx had begun withdrawing money as early as December, fearing the premium Mt.Gox users paid for Bitcoins was a sign of liquidity issues at the Tokyo-based exchange.

But it didn't stop Lee and Samman from sustaining a six-figure loss when Mt.Gox finally went under last month.
"We were one of Mt.Gox's biggest customers but we got no inside  information from them at all," says  Samman, chief operating officer at the trader. "They couldn't answer any questions so it was useless. We were lucky to get off what we needed to get off before the whole thing went down."
In Melbourne, 22-year-old Bitcoin trader Karl Kloppenborg was also burned by the fall of Mt.Gox.
An IT entrepreneur who is building his own Bitcoin exchange, Kloppenborg lost $47,000 in the collapse.

"I realised something was wrong much earlier on   I threatened legal action, and said I'd call the banks," he says. "It became a waiting game when I realised that the money was essentially frozen."
Series of Bitcoin problems
The failure of Bitcoin's most public face is just one in a series of hiccups for the fast-rising virtual currency, after raids on online black market SilkRoad, which dealt solely in Bitcoins, and the purported unmasking of Bitcoin's mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto (later denied by Nakamoto).
For a mathematical code which has seen its value rise from several US  dollars to the thousands in just five years   to be worth $US10 billion ($11.1 billion) at its height   the loss of 744,000 Bitcoins (worth $527 million at Monday's average exchange rate) was no doubt a shock to Bitcoin users, many of whom dedicated their trust to the service.
And the community is no doubt outraged. Despite statements from Mt.Gox that the loss was a theft, resulting from flaws in the system's code, those demanding vigilante justice have attacked the online accounts of Mt.Gox's former chief Mark Karpeles, publishing his personal information and the purported bank balance of the company in 18 different currencies, including nearly $A1 million.
The information has fuelled speculation that Mt.Gox's collapse is more fraud than theft, but provides  little hope that users will have their Bitcoins returned.
In an email trail seen by The Australian Financial Review between  Kloppenborg and Mt.Gox staff, the exchange admitted it was unable to process  Bitcoin withdrawals quickly due to difficulty dealing with major banks.
It's a problem that Bitcoin trader David Parrish says needs to be fixed.
"It's still quite difficult to buy  Bitcoins," says Parrish, a software en gineer at Google Australia. Instead of transferring money through online exchanges, Parrish buys and sells  Bitcoins by physically meeting with like-minded traders.
Average price steady
However, despite a seemingly catastrophic blow to a burgeoning system, Mt.Gox's failure appeared to expose just how little an effect one exchange could have on the global system. Though Mt.Gox's own price collapsed from $US1209 to $US122 shortly before bankruptcy, the average price in the wider market has managed to sustain a $500 average since its collapse, and even risen slightly in recent weeks. Its price remains volatile but it seems those committed to Bitcoin are sticking with it. "People have been looking for reasons to not trust Bitcoin," says  Samman. "But I think it's a short-term negative and long-term positive.
"You get rid of a bad player which was actually becoming detrimental to the liquidity of Bitcoin itself. It will cause people to want to have more regulation than they have in the past."
Governments globally have salivated over the prospect of regulating the currency. Russia has banned  Bitcoin while China has restricted how banks play with the currency. Japan is contemplating rules as regulators in New York float the idea of a  Bitcoin licence.
No plans for Australian regulations
In Australia, however, Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens told a parliamentary committee on Friday that he was "not inclined to feel that we have to rush in as a regulator".
"We have seen some pretty substantial losses incurred by Bitcoin holders in a couple of jurisdictions just in recent weeks," he said. "It is a potential alternative currency so how it will hold its value is the first question. There have been countless currencies through history and the ones that survive are the ones that hold value."
Samman says BTC.sx will join the list of 127,000 creditors seeking retribution from Mt.Gox but is unsure how regulators will even tackle a corporation that deals in assets that countries do not yet recognise.
"They probably will have to tread on very careful water, the judges or whoever is involved in this bankruptcy because if they frame it in a certain way they may get a legal precedent for the legitimacy of Bitcoin," he says.

Bitcoin exchange files for bankruptcy in U.S. court

The collapse of Japan s Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange has spilled into U.S. bankruptcy court as the company scrambles for legal cover after losing digital currency valued at $473 million (U.S.).
Mt. Gox s bankruptcy filing in Dallas late Sunday supplements a similar petition made in Japan late last month following the exchange s abrupt closure. The U.S. case is being brought under Chapter 15 of the country s bankruptcy code, which provides a haven for foreign companies seeking to reorganize their finances.

Mt. Gox s downfall provided fresh ammunition for bitcoin skeptics who have questioned the security and staying power of a digital currency created six years ago as an alternative to government-controlled monetary systems that rely on banks to process most transactions.
Once the world s largest exchange specializing in bitcoins, Mt. Gox is now mired in a financial mess. The exchange froze its users  accounts last month and then shut down after acknowledging it couldn t account for 850,000 bitcoins. Mt. Gox CEO Robert Karpeles blamed most of the losses on computer hackers who took advantage of the exchange s flawed software.
Article Continued Below
The missing currency, valued at $473 million at the time of Mt. Gox s Feb. 28 bankruptcy filing in Japan, represents about 7 per cent of all bitcoins in worldwide circulation, according to court documents.
Although it s based in Tokyo, Mt. Gox is opening a U.S. bankruptcy case in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in the state of Illinois on behalf of all U.S. residents burned by the exchange s demise.
The civil complaint brought against Mt. Gox by Illinois resident Gregory Greene alleges the exchange engaged in fraud and other misconduct. The suit is seeking to be certified as a class action that would represent all U.S. residents who had paid fees to Mt. Gox as part of a bitcoin trade or had their accounts frozen.
Steven Woodrow, a Denver attorney representing Greene, estimates hundreds of thousands of people could be represented in the case. In a Monday interview, Woodrow said he still intends to seek a federal court order that would freeze Mt. Gox s computers and other assets in the U.S. A hearing on Woodrow s request for the court order is scheduled for Tuesday in Chicago.
If the Illinois case proceeds, Mt. Gox attorneys contend that it will drain the company s finances and divert management s attention during a critical time.
Mt. Gox s bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $64 million and assets of $38 million.
Meanwhile, those who are still enthusiasts of the digital currency have donated about $28,000 to Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old physicist who denied a report last week by Newsweek magazine that identified him as bitcoin s creator.
A wallet address set up by Andreas Antonopoulos, chief security officer for Blockchain.info, received more than 1,800 payments, amounting to about 44 bitcoins, according to data on his company s website. That compares with about 1 million coins that the founder of the system owns, worth over $1 billion when the price peaked in December, according to Jered Kenna, a San Francisco-based Bitcoin investor.
The naming of Dorian Nakamoto drew media attention that resulted in the former defence industry and government employee being chased by reporters through Los Angeles. Bitcoin supporters expressed outrage at what they saw as a violation of his privacy and further evidence of news media bias against the nascent digital currency that last month suffered the collapse of one of its largest exchanges.
 If this person is not Satoshi, then these funds will serve as a  sorry for what happened to you ,  Antonopoulos wrote in a post on the Reddit social media website on Saturday.
Bitcoin s cryptographic origins resulted in anonymity being built into the payment protocol and a community that prizes privacy. These same features prompted regulators worldwide to express concern the digital currency may be used for money-laundering and illicit sales, such as the online Silk Road website where customers used coins to buy and sell drugs.
Satoshi Nakamoto has been thought to be a pseudonym for a programmer or group of programmers who wrote the paper and the initial source code for Bitcoin. The code has since been handed off to a loose group of experts affiliated with the Bitcoin Foundation, a Seattle-based advocacy group.

Bitcoin Exchange Mt. Gox Files for U.S. Bankruptcy as Death Spiral Continues
Mark Karpeles, CEO of Mt. Gox, speaks to his attorney at the Tokyo District Court. Image: The Yomiuri Shimbun via AP
The Mt. Gox death spiral continues. The big-name bitcoin exchange has now filed for bankruptcy protection here in the U.S., as well as Japan, and hackers are saying they ve uncovered evidence of fraud at the Tokyo-based company, after allegedly breaking into a website controlled by its CEO.
Mt. Gox was once the most popular site for buying and selling the digital cryptocurrency bitcoin. But The Wall Street Journal . Mt. Gox is facing a class-action lawsuit filed in Illinois, and it has long been involved in a $75 million lawsuit with another bitcoin company, called CoinLab.
The ongoing travails of Mt. Gox act as a metaphor for the bitcoin world as a whole. Though the digital currency is beginning to remake the way the world moves and stores money, many of the companies and individuals that first pushed the technology into the mainstream are now struggling to come to terms with government regulations and the realities of doing business.
At a press conference last month , Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles admitted that the company lost around 750,000 of its customers  bitcoins   worth around half a billion dollars. He blamed a known issue in the bitcoin protocol that enabled hackers to trick the company s software into thinking transactions failed. Apparently, Gox s accounting software didn t deal with this flaw and could be tricked to send repeated bitcoin payouts to the same customers.
How Mt. Gox could have lost so many bitcoins without noticing remains a matter of speculation, and many suspect foul play on the company s part, not just mere incompetence. Among them are the hackers that hijacked Karpeles  personal website and published a file they claim contains data acquired from the company s servers. Included in the file was an Excel spreadsheet showing a balance of 951,116 bitcoins.
The hackers, who also hijacked Karpeles  Reddit account, claim the document proves that Mt. Gox is still in control of those bitcoins. But given Mt. Gox s claim that the bitcoins were stolen without anyone at the company noticing, it would make sense that the company s official balance sheets still show a much larger number of bitcoins. Ultimately, even if the document is authentic, it proves nothing one way or the other.
Many Reddit users claim to have found their own transaction data in the spreadsheet, suggesting that the materials are authentic. But Forbes reporter Andy Greenberg warns that the zip file may contain malware designed to steal bitcoins   and cautions people not to download the file. Neither Karpeles nor Mt. Gox responded to a request for comment about the spreadsheet s origins or authenticity.
The alleged hack follows a number of other leaks and hacks from the company, including a leaked internal document about the missing bitcoins and supposed copies of the code used to run the exchange . Meanwhile, Bitcoin users are dealing with the bankruptcy in their own way: by creating a new currency to buy and sell rights to the lost bitcoins, should they ever be recovered.

Mt. Gox: Bankrupt, Accused and Hacked, Oh My!
By Richard Adhikari
Mar 10, 2014 3:09 PM PT
The drama surrounding Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, has intensified.
The company on Sunday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States -- less than two weeks after taking a similar action in Tokyo, where it's headquartered.
It apparently made this move to freeze a lawsuit initiated in a federal court in Chicago by a customer seeking US$25,000-worth of bitcoins and class action status.
Also on Sunday, hackers broke into the blog and Reddit account of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles and published data purporting to show that Mt. Gox then had access to nearly 1 million bitcoins, and that there was a difference of about 500,000 Bitcoins between the firm's deposits and withdrawals.
A PDF posted last week on the Mt. Gox website warns that cybercriminals are emailing btcoin owners asking for their personal details and bank account numbers, purportedly to notify creditors of their claims.
Where Have All the Bitcoins Gone?
The hackers who published Mt. Gox's files online are in effect accusing the company or CEO Karpeles of having stolen the bitcoins in its coffers.
Another possibility was proposed by Adam Levine and other researchers late last month, just two days before Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Tokyo.
They raised the possibility that the Bitcoins were lost because of incompetence, and pointed out that Mt. Gox had, in effect, played a shell game in 2011, moving more than 400,000 Bitcoins from one account to another to assuage concerns about its solvency at the time.
Either Karpeles or Mt. Gox controls 90,000 Bitcoins unspent since 2011, the researchers contended,  noting that "either the numbers on the Mt. Gox crisis strategy draft are wrong ... or something else is afoot."
That doesn't rule out the possibility of transaction malleability , the researchers said.
Follow That Bitcoin
"Either possibility could be true, and only an in-depth audit will showcase the truth," Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group , told the E-Commerce Times.
Although Bitcoin was set up to provide anonymity, a number of algorithms have been created that can trace transactions back to the people who made them, Enderle pointed out. However, it isn't so easy to track the person who actually holds the bitcoins.
"There have been a number of bitcoin thefts, and I'm not aware of any major arrests, so there's a chance [Karpeles] could get away with this, even with scrutiny," Enderle remarked. "The thieves are getting more creative as well, in order to conceal their thefts."
You Gotta Have Faith...
"I saw this train wreck coming from the start," Jim McGregor, founder and principal analyst at Tirias Research , told the E-Commerce Times. "For anyone who thinks this is a cool thing with no government involvement, I've got news for you -- somebody was looking to make money off this thing."
Still, Bitcoin exchanges have rallied around the virtual currency, and interest in it appears to be growing.
There apparently was a Bitcoin ATM at the South by Southwest Interactive trade show in Austin, Texas, and at least three companies make ATMs for bitcoins. There reportedly are four Bitcoin ATMs in Austin, and four in the Canadian cities of Vancouver and Edmonton.
Coindesk , which carries news about Bitcoin and the exchange rates for the currency, reports that a new patent shows Bitcoin has been part of eBay's planning since 2011.
Still, economist Nouriel Roubini, better known as "Dr. Doom," has tweeted that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme.
Consumers "can't trust a currency that goes through valuation swings like this," Enderle said, "and given that the U.S. is moving aggressively against the use of these currencies, it's doubtful that the current generation will survive."
Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

Japanese bitcoin exchange files US bankruptcy case (Update)

Mt. Gox's bankruptcy papers list liabilities of about $64 million and assets of $38 million.
Mt. Gox also is hoping to use U.S. bankruptcy laws to ward off another lawsuit filed last year in a Seattle federal court by a former U.S. partner, CoinLab Action.
Under an agreement signed in November 2012, CoinLab was supposed to use Mt. Gox's technology to run a bitcoin exchange in the U.S. and Canada. The alliance unraveled within a few months, prompting CoinLab to sue Mt. Gox for alleged breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking $75 million in damages, according to court documents.

Mt. Gox gets U.S. bankruptcy protection, halting lawsuits
Exchange that lost 750,000 customers' bitcoins already filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February

Hold the bitcoin obit: Why the digital currency isn't dead yet
Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, received U.S. bankruptcy protection on Monday to temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company by traders who allege the operation was a fraud.
Judge Harlin Hale in Dallas granted temporary bankruptcy protection to Mt. Gox, which had filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February. Attorneys for Mt. Gox said without bankruptcy protection the company would be irreparably harmed by a proposed class action in Chicago federal court and a breach of contract case in Seattle federal court.
Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in Japan last month after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets. Mt. Gox's founder, Mark Karpeles, was scheduled to be deposed later this month in the Seattle lawsuit.
Mt.Gox a 'fox guarding henhouse'
The attorney leading the class action blasted the bankruptcy as a ruse.
"This case involves a massive fraud," said Steven Woodrow, an attorney leading the class action, told Hale. "They claim incredibly that they will preserve assets and protect assets by entrusting the servers and other property to Mr. Karpeles. Respectfully, your honour, that is the definition of the fox guarding the henhouse."
World's 1st bitcoin ATM opens in Vancouver
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
An attorney for Coinlab Inc, which sued Mt. Gox in Seattle for breaching a contract last year, said her client was troubled by what appeared to be fraudulent behavior by Karpeles in the days leading up the U.S. bankruptcy filing.
"We don't have proof yet but we do have concerns about the movement of hundreds of millions of dollars in bitcoins over the weekend, moved by Mr. Karpeles," said Jane Pearson, an attorney with Foster Pepper.
Mt. Gox's attorney, David Parham, denied there was any fraud and said he believed Karpeles and Mt. Gox were complying with the Japanese bankruptcy proceeding.
Bankruptcy protects U.S. assets
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets.
Hale's order protects Mt. Gox's U.S. assets until April, when the parties will return to court and Mt. Gox will seek a permanent stay of U.S. litigation. Hale said his order staying litigation did not apply to non-debtors, presumably Karpeles.
Karpeles was named in a proposed class action filed in late February by Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident. The lawsuit proposes to represent all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down and prevented traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Seattle by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox.
Shell company run by French-Canadian
Mt Gox's tangled web of shell corporations turns the spotlight back to an issue U.S. law enforcement authorities have perennially raised with Congress. Several states, including Delaware, where Karpeles had at least two registered corporations, let foreigners register new corporations without ever setting foot in the United States, relying instead on agents to act as conduits for the companies' owners.
The agents send along documents like lawsuits and other business communications addressed to the companies but keep no records themselves. They do not keep track of who the company's true beneficial owner may be. When investigators want to find out more about these companies' activities, the only information they can get from the agents is contact information for whatever overseas entity has been designated to receive correspondence about the company.
Such is the structure of Mutum Sigillum, a company Karpeles registered in Delaware. He used it to interact with a U.S. bank through Dwolla, an online payment network. Real money passed through Mutum Sigillum (which means "worthless little symbol" in Latin), but it left almost no paper trail in the United States.
It was registered in Delaware by Vincent Allard, a French-Canadian lawyer who for the past 13 years has been living in Dover, Del., and, along with his daughter, running a business acting as a registered agent for Delaware corporations.
Allard specializes in creating companies for people from Francophone countries since he speaks French.
Little oversight of intermediaries
When reached by phone on March 5, Allard said he had not heard of Mt. Gox's bankruptcy in Japan and would nevertheless have almost nothing to offer investigators if any were to come knocking.
He was not in the office Monday and did not immediately respond to a request by email for comment on the Texas filing.
Representatives from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies have been lobbying Congress for years to pass a bill that would prohibit states from allowing the incorporation of shell companies without better documentation and more oversight.
The Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, introduced in 2011 by Senator Carl Levin, is before the Senate Judiciary Committee awaiting a markup.
The bill would require states to record the identities of the beneficial owners of corporations they register and keep a corresponding driver's licence or passport number, or a copy of a foreign passport on hand, ready to turn over to law enforcement officials if necessary.

03/10/2014 5:35 pm Filed Under: BTC - Bitcoin by Andrew Moran
With three bitcoin exchanges shutting down after experiencing thefts worth hundreds of millions of dollars, some in the bitcoin community are urging government regulation and intervention to protect consumers. It was reported Sunday that Mt. Gox, one of the world s biggest exchange platforms, suffered 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for several days ahead of its shutdown.
After years of the peer-to-peer decentralized system decrying government officials getting involved, should the bitcoin community accept authorities entering into the market? If so, is it justifiable?
Over the past year, since the rise of bitcoin and its growing acceptance among the Internet landscape and merchants, numerous central banks and federal governments have outlined a series of messages : it won t be held responsible if any digital holdings vanish. The institutions have also urged its citizens to be cautious because the cryptocurrency is volatile, risky and vulnerable to security attacks.
Bitcoiners, who many believe to be  techno-libertarians,  scoffed at the suggestion that authority figures should even intervene. The state of New York is in the midst of issuing bitlicenses for businesses transacting with bitcoins, while some federal lawmakers are calling for heightened regulation or outright bans of the virtual currency. Japan has also mulled over the idea of intervening following the failure of Mt. Gox, but instead wants international cooperation.
Although bitcoin was founded on the premise of being decentralized and anonymous and therefore anti-government, using the tools of government could very well be legitimate and still consistent in the digital currency s principles. However, its very nature could prove troublesome for some cash-strapped governments because of the intricacies involved.
Indeed, in a libertarian society, free markets prevail but there is still a role for a government: enforcement of contracts, the protection of private property, safety from fraud and defense against force. The same could be applied here: an invasion of property was undertaken and theft transpired so authorities must investigate and detain the alleged perpetrators. It s as simple as that and perhaps consistent in the libertarian message.
It has become rather prevalent that several leading bitcoin individuals and organizations have called for regulation of the digital currency. We reported that Brian Armstrong, the co-founder and chief executive of Coinbase, called for bitcoin regulation. It was also discovered last month that the Bitcoin Foundation, which has also urged for regulatory actions, worked with the New York prosecutor s office in its probe of Mt. Gox.
On top of all of this, one whistleblower is threatening to unveil a web of corruption at the Bitcoin Foundation. Identified as Two-Bit Idiot, he published a blog post on Tumblr entitled  Coup or Death for the Bitcoin Foundation?  He plans to post another article listing  damning facts,  including:
 There is evidence that Bitcoin Foundation board members may have had direct access to Mark Karpeles which allowed them to personally deposit and withdraw funds from Mt. Gox, despite persistent delays for other customers. 
After a leadership that has decried government coercion against bitcoin, it now seems the same individuals are running to the government for help. Is this the step that the bitcoin community wants to take next? Since the currency is decentralized and there is actual  leader per se, it could be proven difficult to solicit the opinions of its base. Sure, the leadership may want regulations, but what about the people? The people should say if they want regulation or not.

Mt. Gox files for US bankruptcy as hackers publish company records
Mt. Gox files for US bankruptcy as hackers publish company records
By Joel Hruska on March 10, 2014 at 5:14 pm
Comment
Mt. Gox, the former major Bitcoin exchange, has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US as part of a bid to protect itself from legal action in this country. The exchange had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan back in February, but had avoided doing so in the United States. This latest move was almost certainly precipitated by Sunday s announcement that hackers had breached Mt. Gox s records and were publishing data dumps  proving  that Mt. Gox still possessed roughly 950,000 Bitcoins   far more than the 850,000 the company claims to have lost.
Considering that 850,000 BTC is still worth roughly $530 million at today s exchange rates, it s easy to see why so many people are incensed at the actions of Mt. Gox and the disappearance of its CEO, Mark Karpeles. Reports on Mt. Gox s troubles over the past few months paint Karpeles as distracted, poorly organized, and ultimately more interested in launching a Bitcoin cafe in the same building as the exchange rather than working to solve the security problems of the site itself .
The hackers released screenshots and other data that purport to show Mt. Gox moving hundreds of BTC to customer wallets even after  transaction malleability  issues had supposedly prevented Mt. Gox from making any transactions at all . Filing for bankruptcy protection in the US allows the company to protect its US assets and recognize its declaration of bankruptcy in US Courts. It can be contested by US creditors.
Unfortunately for Karpeles, filing for legal protection in the United States immediately after hackers claim to have discovered allegations of criminal misconduct will almost certainly fan the flames of the investors and BTC owners already calling for his head. Bankruptcy protection is not an absolute shield   it can protect a company from being chopped up and liquidated by creditors (at least, for a little while)   but it doesn t shield a company from criminal charges or theft of property.
One word of caution, however, before accepting the word of the hacking crew as gospel: others have noted that attempts to read Mt. Gox s activities through the block chain are exceptionally difficult, partly because the software that performs deep block chain analysis is still in its infancy. Similarly, pouring through hundreds of megabytes of records doesn t automatically link those logged transactions with the block chain history.
Even if data released by the hack is legitimate, it will take a great deal of time to establish its authenticity and confirm that Mt. Gox is or isn t criminally absconding with other people s money. If the company has engaged in criminal fraud, than filing bankruptcy won t save it. If it hasn t, then the leaks may end up shedding light on how the attacks against Mt. Gox were carried out   which could, in turn, lead to criminal negligence charges depending on the nature of the security breaches.
It s clear that Mark Karpeles had neither the intelligence nor the discipline to lead a major Bitcoin exchange, but teasing out the details of the attacks and establishing Mt. Gox s culpability is going to take time. Meanwhile, the overarching situation around BTC continues to take its own bizarre turns. On Friday, BTC blogger Ryan Selkis promised to unleash information that would destroy the legitimacy of the Bitcoin Foundation by elaborating on various unspecified  damning facts. 
On Monday, Selkis declared that he had made a tactical error and would not be publishing said facts, leaving the community with plenty of questions and a great deal of mud to fling   but not much more. Then there s last week s battle over the identity of Sakoshi Nakamoto who may ( or may not) be a 64-year-old man living in the Los Angeles foothills. In every instance, who you believe depends far more on faith than on hard fact. Speculation on the motivations and identities of the players runs just as rampant as speculation on cryptocurrencies themselves.

After our two part expos  on Bitcoin robber baron Mark Marie Robert Karpel s , the fallen CEO's "MagicalTux" blog was briefly taken over by hackers this weekend, before someone -- perhaps Mr. Karpel s -- shut it down.
I. Mark Karpel s Decides to Stop Sharing After Hack
Fortunately, his accounts of such items as....
His secret Apple pie recipe
Accounts of at least two employers firing him.
His fantasies of himself as a superhero
His financial problems
His 2006 unexecuted plan to commit suicide by hanging himself with a network cable
...are all still very much available.  Just head over to Archive.org and find them all here .  To translate them from French to English, just type:
http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&tl=en&u=
...pasting the url of the archive.org link after the "u=".
He subsequently took his Flickr account private:
... but you can, of course, enjoy the pictures we have posted as per U.S. Fair Use laws (given the legal/academic relevance of the case, see: TITLE 17 > CHAPTER 1 >   107 ).
A quick note before we get started -- Redditors have discovered that apparently Mr. Karpel s owns a trademark on the term "Bitcoin" in Europe (and formerly Australia, but he forgot to renew that one ).  So even if Mr. Karpel s goes to jail, unless he is somehow stripped up of the trademark, he "owns" the term Bitcoin -- in Europe, at least.
II. We Have No Bitcoins (Or So We SAY)
But the hack wasn't just a defacement attempt.  An unauthorized blog entry was posted, likely the Russian/Eastern European ring that exploited Mr. Karpel s' servers via his failure to patch his beloved Gentoo Linux.
Oh look it's another post from Mr. Karpel s.  Wonder if he is going to tell us all how great he is?  Oh, wait, he just got hacked.  Whoops.
In the blog they write:
First and foremost, this is not Mark Karpeles. F**k that b**ch-titted motherf*****.
It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.
Above you will finding download link and a mirror used without asking from Mark Karpeles very own blog.magicaltux.net.
Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included.
Repost and share this info before it s gone. Lots of people, including us, lost money and coins. Upvote this post.
We stole no bitcoins. There were none to steal.
The blog appears to show Mt. Gox has 951,116 Bitcoins -- a fortune worth $611.6M USD at current exchange rates.  Of this, 500,000 is estimated to be customer Bitcoins.
The hackers comment:
That fat f**k has been lying!!
Of course the man had a history of lying, according to his former employers.  A discipline letter from 2004 states:
I found it particularly troubling that you would lie [to me] when i asked you about what you were working on and that you [did not stop] your use of this software to chat after several requests for explanation [of your behavior].
If correct, this would be a wild twist as Mt. Gox and Mr. Karpel s claim to be bankrupt , with basically no Bitcoins.
III. Picture Me Rolling
The leak also includes a personal address for Mr. Karpel s.
Hi guys, just off to my Tokyo penthouse.

Googling the Meguro Ward, Tokyo property, we found a nice description of it on Houserep-Tokyo.com, and it sounds quite posh:
The luxury high rise residence "La Tour Aobadai" is located in southern Shibuya area, closer to Nakameguro / Ikejiri Ohashi. Just like other "La Tour" series, it has amenities such as "Concierge Service at Reception Desk","Valet Service", "Sky Lounge", "Party Room", "Fitness Room", "Trunk Room", "Garden Lounge", etc. and a great view. Only its location might be inconveniece because the closest station "Ikejiri Ohashi" & "Shinsen" are a kind of mainors (an express trains don't stop at the stations), and the major one "Shibuya" station is 14 min. walk away. However, this La Tour Aobadai especially provides "Shuttle Buss" directly goes to Shibuya station from the building !!
Rents start at around  350,000 (~$3390 USD) per month (so roughly $40,600 USD per year), but that's just a one bedroom flat.  Given Mr. Karpel s feelings of entitlement and insecurity , it seems doubtful that he'd be "slumming it" with such an entry level model.  He's likely inhabiting one of the swankier suites, which go for around  500,000 to  600,000 ($4,843 to $5,812 USD) per month (so close to $70k USD per year).
La Tour Aobadai is a dream home, if you can afford it. [Image Source: RealEstate-Japan]
Oh and parking is  42,000 (~$400 USD) a month ($4,800+ USD per year) -- plus, you know, tips for the valet and such.
You'd need to earn -- or steal -- a lot of Bitcoins to afford that kind of high roller living.  But that's chump change if you happen to be the self-ordained "king of Bitcoin."
Here's a video tour of the property:
Here's a view from the CEO's window:

With all these views, you can almost picture what life might be like as Bitcoin's biggest scammer.  And by the looks of it, life is pretty spectacular.
IV. Pay Me An Extra Fee And You'll Get Your Bitcoins... I Swear*
Even if the allegation that Mr. Karpel s is faking insolvency proves inaccurate, there's the little nagging issue of how he continued to charge customers the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars in fees even after he clearly had ceased all withdrawals and had no intention of repayment (from Oct. to Jan.)...
@zikuladrak because it works better. Minimum fee is required for relaying, higher fee helps even more getting in the blockchain
  Mark Karpeles (@MagicalTux) October 30, 2013
Typically Mr. Karpel s charged 0.0001 BTC/kB for Mt. Gox withdrawals.  But after he claimed his exchange ran out of funds, he had the boldness to charge 0.005 BTC/kB, multiplying his fees by a factor of 50.
Even after he claims to have lost all his customer funds, Mr. Karpel s wasn't afraid of charging them a fee 50 times his normal rate for the promise they "might" get their money back.  "Might", it appears, turned out to be "might not."
[Image Source: Mark Karpel s on Flickr; Fair Use clause  TITLE 17 > CHAPTER 1 >   107 ]
Considering the extent the Bitcoin baron had already likely defrauded customers, taking them for a couple of thousand more Bitcoins seemed gratuitous.  But then again, Mr. Karpel s had them on a hook and desparate, just like a classic email scam.
Check out this chart from Blockchain of all Bitcoins transactions identified as exchange fees per month. 
Notice the sharp spikes towards the end of 2013? That's likely Mr. Karpel s' handiwork.
Based on that chart, he might have taken 1,000-2,000 BTC ($640K to $1.28M USD) at most, but for those that paid and got nothing, that must have been an especially bitter blow.
Such a double dipping scam is characteristic of top scammers worldwide, including the infamous Nigerian email scams , which would seek to pile on with more requests and promises of reward, even after the initial gains.
Judging by his resume, Mr. Karpel s appeared to be too lazy and emotionally unstable to work in his chosen profession.  But after being fired twice, quitting twice, being arrested at least twice, having several hosting startups flop due to poor customer service, he finally figured out what he was good at -- becoming Bitcoin's biggest scammer.
V. Bitcoin Cafe
But, hey, he needs the money, right?
After all he still hasn't finished his $1M+ USD into his "Bitcoin Cafe", a French restaurant in his new Cerulean Towers Tokyo Office high rise, which housed the now-bankrupt Mt. Gox and Tibanne, Ltd. (its parent).  Wired writes :
Karpeles was obsessed with a new project: The Bitcoin Cafe. Inspired by a French bistro, it would be a stylish hang-out located in the same building as the Mt. Gox offices, a very-new-looking building of metal and glass within walking distance of Tokyo s largest train station. You could drop by for a beer or some wine, and   using a cash register proudly hacked by Mark Karpeles   you could buy it all with bitcoin. When WIRED tried to meet with Karpeles and Mt. Gox at their offices this past October   and a company representative turned us away, saying that legal reasons prevented Mt. Gox from talking to the press   the placard in the lobby of the building already identified the cafe. This company representative said it would open by the end of the year. It never did.
Bitcoin Cafe [Image Source: Wired]
An insider describes to Wired how the disgraced CEO fiddled while Mt. Gox burned, stating:
[Karpeles] was super-proud of being able to use his hacked cash register with the code he wrote.
Another "inside source" expands upon this theme, telling Wired:
Aside from the cafe, he liked to spend time fixing servers, setting up networks and installing gadgets  probably distracting himself from dealing with the real issues that the company was up against
Alas the cafe's site is offline and its construction has been left unfinished. But never fear, you can always view it in Google's cache .
The teaser reads:
The Bitcoin Cafe will be a space for both the casual [and the] formal , with beers, wines, and specialty coffees from around the world.  And it will offer stylish French and global dishes.
The cafe has the ambiance you might encounter in a Parisian deli, or in one of the packed city cafes.  It's casual , but it unusual.  Please stop by to enjoy our lineup shortly, a lineup exclusively prepared for the Bitcoin Cafe.
Opening March 2014
The cafe has yet to open.  Here's another blog that is related to the cafe, which remains active.
Here's a picture of the inside (admittedly blurry) from the Redditor who first spotted the cafe.
[Image Source: Reddit/ croketg29 ]
And here's its mail box, right next to the mailbox for Mr. Karpel s' Tibanne (named after his cat):
[Image Source: Reddit/ croketg29 ]
From cafes to condos, one thing is for certain; Mr. Karpel s may have had a tough time finding his talent, but his chosen profession (Bitcoin scams) has treated him quite handsomely.  The only headache for him is the question is what comes next.
It should be interesting how the Tokyo Bankruptcy Court takes these developments, though. 
Mr. Karpel s reportedly fled to Japan after legal trouble in his native France.
[Image Source: Mark Karpel s on Flickr; Fair Use clause  TITLE 17 > CHAPTER 1 >   107 ]
Mr. Karpel s previously fled to France, under allegations of fraud from a former employer.  He could always repeat that tactic (fleeing to Nigeria, perhaps?), but it's going to be a tough decision.  After all, the life of (ill-gotten) luxury is hard to turn away from.

Mt. Gox files for U.S. bankruptcy to halt class action
REUTERS/Jim Urquhart/Files
Mar 10, 2014
, Last Updated: 1:21 PM ET
Mt. Gox, once the world's largest bitcoin exchange, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection in Dallas late Sunday, a move that will temporarily halt U.S. legal action against the Japanese company.
Mt. Gox, which filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan in February, said without U.S. protection it would spend substantial funds defending itself against a U.S. lawsuit seeking class action status that was filed in federal court in Chicago.
A hearing in Dallas was scheduled for 1:30 p.m. local time on Monday to consider Mt. Gox's request to stay pending lawsuits against the company.
The plaintiff leading the Chicago lawsuit was scheduled on Tuesday to ask a federal judge to freeze Mt. Gox's U.S.-based servers and other computer equipment and to set up a trust over Mt. Gox's assets.
Mt. Gox's Japan filing last month came after it said it may have lost 750,000 of its customers' bitcoins as part of an attack by hackers.
Mt. Gox said in papers filed with the Dallas court that the hacking attack was the subject of an intense investigation that indicated so far the bitcoins were lost as a result of a flaw in the software algorithm that underlies bitcoin, the digital currency.
The Chapter 15 filing allows Mt. Gox to ask the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to recognize its foreign bankruptcy and to assist in the Japanese proceedings by protecting its U.S.-based assets. U.S. creditors can contest Mt. Gox's request for Chapter 15 protection.
Mt. Gox is defending itself against at least two U.S. lawsuits.
In late February, Gregory Greene, an Illinois resident, sued the company in Chicago on behalf of all U.S. residents who paid a trading fee to Mt. Gox and those who had bitcoins or other currency with the exchange when it halted bitcoin withdrawals on Feb. 7.
Greene is seeking to recoup millions of dollars lost when the mtgox.com website went down, preventing traders from selling as bitcoin prices plummeted last month.
Steven Woodrow, an attorney for Greene, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mt. Gox is also defending a lawsuit in federal court in Washington state filed by CoinLab Inc for breach of contract. CoinLab is seeking damages of $75 million from Mt. Gox. Mark Karpeles, Mt. Gox's chief executive officer, was scheduled to be deposed in that case later this month, according to court documents.
Mt. Gox is represented by David Parham of Baker & McKenzie.
The case is Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

Mt. Gox Files Bankruptcy within US

Just last month, it was reported that bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox vanished from the Internet. At the time, the website for the major exchange was unavailable and over 744,000 bitcoins were supposedly missing due to malleability-related theft. In all, Mt. Gox lost around $474 million worth of bitcoins due to a software algorithm flaw that underlies bitcoin, according to the exchange. A major investigation is ongoing however, which may provide different information regarding the loss of bitcoins. Now, the major bitcoin exchange has filed for bankruptcy within the United States, seeking protection against various lawsuits that have been filed by customers of Mt. Gox. If the bankruptcy petition is approved, claims against the company will be halted temporarily.
The bankruptcy filing was made by the only board member of Mt. Gox, Mark Karpeles. The case is identified as Mt. Gox Co Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 14-31229.

While the Bitcoin community is impatiently waiting for Mt. Gox to provide details on the massive hacker attack that stole 6 percent of all the Bitcoin in the world, a group of hackers, who claim to have broken into the bankrupted Bitcoin exchange's servers, said that the company still has at least some of customers' Bitcoins.
According to a Forbes report , the hacker group on Sunday took over the personal blog and Reddit account of Mt. Gox's CEO Mark Karpeles to announce that the exchange has access to a portion of the Bitcoins that the company had said were stolen from customers.
To support the claim, the group uploaded a series of files including an Excel spreadsheet of over a million trades, a screenshot purportedly confirming the hackers' access to the data, a list of Mark Karpeles  home addresses, his personal CV, and more.
Hackers also point to a balance file, which reportedly shows a balance of 951,116 Bitcoins, to prove that Mt. Gox's claim to have lost customers  Bitcoins to hackers is nothing but a lie.  That fat fuck has been lying!! , a note in the file from the hackers reportedly reads.
While the legitimacy of the database dump is yet to be verified, it could also be an accounting mismatch with the company's actual store of Bitcoins, report says. The stolen money hasn't yet appeared on the log of Bitcoin blockchain, the public ledger of transactions that prevents fraud and forgery in the Bitcoin economy, suggesting that whoever has it isn't spending it at the moment.
In another, possibly related event, a user on the BitcoinTalk forum posted a message offering a 20 GB stolen database from Mt. Gox for 100 Bitcoins. According to the user, the database contains Mt. Gox users' personal details and passport scans.

The Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange that recently collapsed in Japan has filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection to shield itself from a lawsuit seeking to repay thousands of people whose digital currency is now missing.
The U.S. filing made in Dallas late Sunday supplements a bankruptcy petition that Mt. Gox submitted in Japan at the end of last month.
Mt. Gox was once the world's largest exchange specializing in bitcoins, but now finds itself in a financial mess after losing about 850,000 bitcoins valued at $473 million, according to court documents.
Although it's based in Tokyo, Mt. Gox is opening a bankruptcy case in the U.S. in an attempt to delay a recent federal lawsuit filed in Illinois on behalf of all U.S. residents burned by the exchange's abrupt demise.

Hackers Continue Attacking Bitcoin Exchange Mt. Gox, As It Seeks Bankruptcy Protection In U.S.
The chapter 15 bankruptcy filing would give the cryptocurrency exchange reprieve from a federal class-action lawsuit.

After filing for bankruptcy in Japan last month, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has done the same in the U.S., seeking bankruptcy protection to temporarily halt a class-action lawsuit that aims to recoup lost funds.
The insolvent exchange went dark at the end of February amid news it lost about 750,000 Bitcoins in a heist that went unnoticed for years. With Bitcoin companies becoming an increasingly popular target for attacks , hackers over the weekend allegedly gained access to Mt. Gox s database, purportedly showing the exchange still had more than 950,000 Bitcoins worth about $590 million . They published this information on Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles s Reddit account, which was also hijacked (the post has since been taken down), and pastebin .
 It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,  wrote the attackers.  This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data.

Hackers attack blog of Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange CEO, look for 'proof of fraud'

The web accounts of Mark Karpeles, CEO of the volatile Mt. Gox bitcoin exchange, have been repeatedly electronically assaulted, with enraged hackers reportedly evaluating the data after the exchange lost some $465 million in bitcoins in February.
Tags SciTech , Politics , Currencies , Finance , Bitcoin
 It's time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin community's wrath   instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting goxed,  hackers   wrote in a message posted to Karpeles  personal website and   Pastebin. The term  Goxed  stems from Mt. Gox repeatedly delaying   its reopening in 2011 (as well as going offline or suspending   trade on numerous other occasions), and means to fool or troll   someone.
"Included in this download you will find relevant database   dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted   summaries compiled from data," the hackers wrote. "No   user database dumps have been included."
The bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy in late February after   it was apparently plagued with technical glitches, losing nearly   750,000 bitcoins, or 6-7 percent of total units in circulation.
However, some Mt. Gox users weren t convinced of the explanation   that technical bugs had caused the loss. Some suggested that the   missing money had been absorbed by Karpeles.
Attacks have subsequently been undertaken on both Karpeles    personal blog and his Reddit account, to look for evidence that   he was responsible for fraud.
The attackers took as much information as possible surrounding   trading activity at Mt. Gox and stored their findings in a 716MB   file.
The file contained a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet detailing some   one million trades, and another which showed company balances in   18 various currencies, according to Forbes.
The claimed balance of 951,116 bitcoins found by hackers and   outlined in their summary was cited as evidence that Karpeles had   been lying about losing the bitcoins to a bug.  That fat f***   has been lying!!  states a note in the file.
The authenticity of the file is still to be confirmed. However,   some Reddit users told CNET that they could confirm that their   personal account balances matched the data in the posting. Other   Redditors suggested the file contained malware, and as a result   would not open it.
Mt. Gox later released a warning saying that  Spam/Phishing   emails looking as if Mt. Gox was the sender are being sent to our   users. These emails have not been sent by us and should be   phishing emails. 
Despite the loss of some 750,000 bitcoins, there has   as of yet     been no evidence of their movement in the bitcoin blockchain.   This suggests that the bitcoins are not currently being spent.
At its peak, Mt. Gox was one of the most prominent bitcoin   exchanges in the world. However, on February 7, the platform   suspended its customer withdrawals, and bitcoin plunged   but Mt.   Gox did not stop trading the cryptocurrency.
Mt. Gox filed for US bankruptcy protection in Dallas on Sunday,   after initially filing for bankruptcy protection in Japan on   February 28.

Bitcoin s been getting ugly. Very ugly.
The first rumblings came last summer, when Mt Gox, the biggest bitcoin exchange at the time, began dragging its feet meeting redemptions. By November, some people were waiting weeks to get their withdrawal requests honored . Many waited three months or more for their money  while bitcoin prices soared. If Mt Gox were a bank or securities broker dealer, it would have long ago earned the scrutiny of multiple regulatory agencies. But Mt Gox is none of those things.
Mt Gox, the online repository of billions of dollars worth of the beleaguered, nationless, digital currency, is actually the ancestor of an online site first launched in 2007, where nerds and geeks could trade Magic  cards   a popular fantasy card game.
Jed McCaleb, the site s founder, read an article about Bitcoin somewhere and wrote some code turning his playing card site into an unregulated online currency exchange. And eventually sold 88 percent of it to a French national named Mark Karpeles. The site grew under Karpeles, and eventually handled more than 70 percent of the world s bitcoin float   amassing billions of dollars in theoretical assets, given bitcoin s exchange rates   but still operating in a regulatory vacuum.
This much is by design. Bitcoin aficionados were generally careful about not attracting regulator attention. Among the key attractions of bitcoin were its independence from governments and central banks.
Mt Gox suffered a serious security breach in 2011, in which a hacker transferred a bunch of bitcoins to himself at a penny per bitcoin, and then began to sell them. A number of large accounts ate the loss, but the price returned to normal in a few minutes, so the damage could be limited.
There were a number of teething problems, as well, attributed to programming snafus or confusion with other online exchanges. But in reality, there was a cancer that was already eating away at Mt Gox and bitcoin from the inside. Thieves, hackers or insiders had penetrated the network somehow, and stole $400 million.
Meanwhile, even as Mt Gox was going through its death throes, Autumn Radtke, a Wisconsin native and the CEO of another bitcoin exchange, First Meta, turned up dead in her Singapore apartment. She was 28. Singapore officials have not yet announced an official cause of death, but early indications seem to point to suicide.
Flexcoin, another bitcoin exchange out of Canada, hung up its spurs this week , too, after announcing that hackers had pierced its servers and stole all of its  hot wallet  bitcoin   $600,000 worth at the then-current exchange rate. (The company s clients who held bitcoin in servers that were not connected to the Internet didn t lose money. The hacker couldn t get to those accounts.)
 Flexcoin has made every attempt to keep our servers as secure as possible, including regular testing. In our ~3 years of existence we have successfully repelled thousands of attacks. But in the end, this was simply not enough,  the company said in a statement posted online.
 Having this be the demise of our small company, after the endless hours of work we ve put in, was never our intent. We ve failed our customers, our business, and ultimately the Bitcoin community. 
While we don t know yet what led to Ms. Radke s suicide   assuming it was, indeed, a suicide, bitcoin has been under sophisticated attack for a long time. Flexcoin managers announced that they had actually repelled thousands of attacks over their time in operation before hackers found the flaw and wiped them out.
Bitcoin had a good chance of pulling through intact if the damage were limited to problems at Mt Gox. The stolen bitcoin were substantial, but amounted to 6 percent of the world s float. Some players were happy to see Mt Gox go, as it happened.
Bitcoin bears have argued that the widely distributed computer mining and storage system that was bitcoin s greatest strength and attraction may become its fatal flaw: The encryption and firewall technology at these small, innovative online exchanges is just not up to the task of fending off the world s most sophisticated and determined cyber-criminals and state cyber-warfare agencies, who may have been teaming up to steal as much bitcoin as they could   and no doubt sell it before the word got out. Megan McArdle, writing for Bloomberg, wrote that the Mt Gox meltdown   spells doom for bitcoin.  
Reports of Bitcoin s Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated
While bitcoin did pull back from its early December peak, and has been declining all last February, the price has recovered somewhat in March, to levels it was at in mid-November   before the fatal problems at Mt Gox and Flexcoin were discovered. At press time, bitcoin was trading in the $667 range.
Will we have more exchanges go down to theft and fraud? No doubt other exchanges are being targeted by online criminals and perhaps state actors as we speak. And no doubt these exchanges themselves are scrambling to beef up their firewalls and encryption security and tighten up their code. They can all expect the very toughest adversaries in the hacker business, and they won t let up any time soon.
Bitcoin seems more secure if you keep your digital coin offline   that is, not connected to the Internet. Keep it in an offline hard drive that s not even hooked up to your computer   and then don t lose that hard drive!
Meanwhile, bitcoin is very good at one thing: Transferring large sums of money around the world, cheap, with near perfect anonymity. That is bitcoin s unique value proposition   and it seems that that value proposition is sufficiently valuable for a critical mass of people to endure the significant price volatility and the risk of hacker theft.

MtGox bitcoin database leaked online as hackers crowdsource clues
Every transaction on MtGox since 2011 has been leaked online by hackers accusing the company s chief executive of stealing their money

Hackers took over the Reddit account and personal blog of Mark Karpeles, the chief executive of shuttered bitcoin exchange MtGox, on Sunday night.
The anonymous attackers used the accounts to post an angry letter accusing Karpeles of stealing bitcoins from his site s former users, and posted a 750Mb zip file which they say comprises data stolen directly from MtGox s servers.
 It s time that MTGOX got the bitcoin communities wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed,  the hackers wrote on Karpeles  blog,   Magical Tux   (and crossposted to Pastebin ).  This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than would have liked to verify the data. 
Several members of the bitcoin community claim to have found their own transactions included in the dump, which would indicate that the leak is genuine. The hacker or hackers themselves say they were careful to strip out any passwords from the database. But other reports suggest that a second scam could be involved, with an application contained within the zip file, called TibanneBackOffice, apparently stealing users  bitcoin wallets.
The hackers imply that one particular line in the data, which shows MtGox as holding 951,000 bitcoins at the time of its collapse, is proof of the company s malfeasance, annotating the line with the comment:  That fat fuck has been lying!!  However, others who have downloaded the database point out that it remains possible that MtGox s internal accounts were out of sync with the amount of money they actually held.
Roubini: it s a Ponzi scheme
The release of the MtGox database followed a stinging attack on bitcoin by influential economist Nouriel Roubini.
Writing on Twitter, Roubini said that , apart from a base for criminal activities,  bitcoin is not a currency .  Bitcoin is not a unit of account as no price of goods and services is set in Bitcoin unit nor it ever will. So it isn t a currency,  he added .
Instead, he contended that bitcoin is between  a Ponzi game and a conduit for criminal/illegal activities. And it isn t safe given hacking of it. 
A Ponzi, or  pyramid , scheme relies on taking money from people joining it to pay out as interest to people who joined earlier; as such it is unsustainable. Bernie Madoff operated a giant pyramid scheme, for which he was jailed. But pyramid schemes were also blamed for a collapse in the Albanian economy in 1996/7, when they amounted to almost half of the country s GDP - and their collapse led to civil war and thousands of deaths.
Less damage seems to have been caused by a site called  Ponzicoin , which offered 120% repayments on bitcoins deposited with it through what its creator openly acknowledged was a pyramid scheme - illegal in a number of countries. According to the site s creator , all depositors have been refunded; he blamed hackers for compromising his site and, he said, making it appear that he had run off with their money.

Bitcoin exchange MtGox has filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States.
MarketWatch reported the defaulted Bitcoin exchange filed for Chapter 15 in the States to protect itself from lawsuits as it attempts to pay off its 6.5 billion yen (about $64m,  38m, AU$71m) debts.
MtGox previously filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan on February 28 , which only helped those in Tokyo and the US. With this new measur, foreign debtors and parties who lost their bitcoins on the MtGox can go through the US bankruptcy courts and systems to resolve their cases.
Earlier last month, MtGox lost track of 750,000 Bitcoins deposited by users as well as 100,000 of its own digital coins. As one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, it held more than 6% of the world's cryptocurrency, worth roughly $549 million (about  329m, AU$608m) by today's trading rates.
Can't catch a break
In another bit of bad news, over the weekend hackers cracked into MtGox CEO Mark Karpeles' personal blog MagicalTux.net as well as his Tumblr and Reddit accounts.
The hackers used their access to post a zip file entitled MtGox2014Leak that claimed to reveal evidence of MtGox wrongdoing. Alleged internal documents inside the compressed archive claimed to reveal how the defunct exchange stole customer holdings and wrote them off as targets of theft.
The file and Karpeles' personal blog have already been taken down, but not before users on Twitter and Reddit supposedly confirmed their personal account balances on the included Excel spreadsheet, potentially verifying its legitimacy.
It's likely the same document also held passwords connected with MtGox, so we strongly urge users to change any of the same passwords they may have used elsewhere.

Bitcoin News: Mt. Gox CEO Accused of Hoarding  Stolen  Coins
Hackers claim Mt.Gox has a balance of 951,116 bitcoins
Mar 10, 2014, 1:39 pm EDT   |  By William White , InvestorPlace Writer
   
Hackers have accused Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles of  holding on to stolen bitcoins .
A group of anonymous hackers claim to have hacked into Mt. Gox and found evidence of fraud. The hackers posted in a blog that Mt. Gox didn t actually have the bitcoins stolen from them, but instead that they faked the event and filed for bankruptcy in order to keep around $500 million worth of bitcoins, reports UPI.com
The post from the hackers included a database dump that allegedly shows personal data, a spreadsheet of trades, Mt.Gox s bitcoin balance and screenshots of the hackers  access to the data. The hackers claim that this data shows that Mt. Gox has a balance of 951,116 bitcoins, UPI.com notes.
Some Reddit users have claimed that the Bitcoin database released by the hackers is real. These users claim that they have been able to find their own accounts within the database, reports Forbes .

A hack on the blog owned by Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles calls into questions some of the claims the company made in its bankruptcy announcement. Hackers uploaded a data dump which they claim shows customer data with real account balances. According to TechCrunch , users of the bitcoin site say the information is accurate because they have located their own balances on the data sheet.
Mt. Gox stated it lost 850,000 bitcoin
Perhaps the most interesting piece of information on that data dump is where it shows that Mt. Gox had a balance of more than 951,000 bitcoins. That s significantly more than the 850,000 bitcoins the company said it had stolen. Of course this doesn t mean that Mt. Gox lied or even miscalculated the number of bitcoins it had. However, there are enough users who claim their balances are on the data dump to suggest that there is a chance that something fishy is going on here.
Along with the data dump, the hacker also posted a mirror page, which provides a clue about the identity of the hacker. It states,  I hated working with you. You deserve everything you get for what you did.  That note also suggests that there s something more going on than what Mt. Gox has told the public.
Mt. Gox files for bankruptcy in U.S.
Mt. Gox has now filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. as well as Japan. The bitcoin exchange operator filed in Japan last month  an inevitable end to a weeks-long shutdown of the company s site. The company claims hackers stole its bitcoins and that it will be unable to pay back what was stolen. Mt. Gox s U.S. filing will temporarily stop U.S. legal action against it. Already a lawsuit seeking class action status has been filed against the bitcoin exchange. The lead plaintiff in that suit wants a judge to freeze the company s U.S.-based servers and equipment and create a trust over the company s assets.

Mt. Gox files for bankruptcy in U.S., CEO's accounts hacked
Filing under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code, the U.S. will now be able to help foreign debtors and parties, as well as provide Mt. Gox with financial aid, if applicable.
By Ananth Baliga   |   March 10, 2014 at 9:50 AM
Comments
NEW YORK, March 10 (UPI) -- Mt. Gox, once the largest bitcoin exchange, filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. on Sunday, after filing for similar protection in Tokyo last month.
The bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 15 , which deals with insolvency cases that spread across more than one country. By filing in the U.S., foreign debtors can now find recourse in U.S. courts and the U.S. will be able to work with foreign countries and parties to help solve the case, as well as protect the interests of Mt. Gox's creditors and its remaining assets.
Over the weekend, anonymous hackers seemed to have taken over some of the accounts of CEO Mark Karpeles, an action that seems to have stemmed from the growing frustration over the uncertainty surrounding Mt. Gox. The attackers took over Karpeles' personal blog and Reddit account , accessing information about Mt. Gox's trading activity.
The hackers posted a 716 MB file containing all the information they had accessed. It contained a spreadsheet of millions of trades, entries from Mt. Gox's business ledger and information about its back-office administration software.
"It's time that Mt. Gox got the Bitcoin community's wrath instead of [the] Bitcoin community getting Goxed," wrote the hackers in a message along with the data file.
Goxed refers to the sudden interruptions in trading Mt. Gox imposed last month when it was having to deal with technical glitches. Last month, Mt. Gox shut down its service abruptly, took down its Twitter feed and deactivated its website following a glitch in their Bitcoin wallet. Later it was revealed that the company had lost approximately 750,000 bitcoins deposited by users and 100,000 of its own bitcoins.

Press Release
Queens Bankruptcy Attorney Bruce Feinstein, Esq. Speaks About the Issues of Bitcoin and Bankruptcy in the Digital Age
>
PRWEB.COM Newswire
Queens, NY (PRWEB) March 10, 2014
On Friday, February 28, 2014, the world s largest Bitcoin exchange filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan. The company, Mt. Gox, was based in Tokyo but has thousands of Bitcoin investors around the world. And while Mt. Gox has little recognition among Americans, it does raise several important issues surrounding bankruptcy in the new digital age. Bruce Feinstein, Esq., a bankruptcy attorney in Queens , New York, is using this recent news to shed light on the questions surrounding digital currency and bankruptcy in an increasingly global economy.
 My clients are new to the Bitcoin phenomenon, some of them have never even heard of it,  says Mr. Feinstein.  But that only further underlines the fact that we need to start informing ourselves about Bitcoin and how to treat it when it comes to bankruptcy. One day we may all be dealing in digital currency, and our federal and state laws must provide the proper legal pathways to handle the issues that arise in our evolving global financial market. 
Bitcoin is a form of decentralized digital currency established in 2009. It uses cryptography to control the creation and transfer of funds, and bitcoin holders can transfer the money using a special software on their computers and mobile devices. The Bitcoin phenomenon spawned a number of start-ups and trading companies, one of which was Mt. Gox. The company grew into a major player in the Bitcoin industry, only to be toppled when hackers stole approximately $460 million, or 850, 000 bitcoins according to a Wired Magazine article published on March 3 , 2014. Mt. Gox subsequently filed for bankruptcy after stopping trades and refusing to pay out its investors.
It s stories like these that take innovations like Bitcoin and turn them into nightmare scenarios. Mr Feinstein adds,  On the surface, a company like Mt. Gox is a wonderful entrepreneurial concept. But when you re working in a new financial market that is taking place outside the banking industry and outside the Fed, you begin to encounter safety concerns such as lack of regulation, possible money laundering, and cyber attacks. 
And when a cyber attack did affect Mt. Gox, the result was devastating for the company and its investors. Mr. Feinstein advocates a discussion about creating a legal structure for digital currencies that will protect those who invest in them and develop them. Mt. Gox entered the equivalent of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S., and Mr. Feinstein s firm   which provides Chapter 11 and Chapter 7 bankruptcy aid - continues to monitor this developing story.
The Law Offices of Bruce Feinstein, Esq. has nearly two decades of experience in bankruptcy law, helping clients and families resolve their issues and move forward with their lives. Visit bfeinsteinesq.com for more information or call (718) 514-9770 to reach the New York office.

Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox gets hacked, is accused of understating losses
CEO Mark Karpeles accused of 'misleading customers'
0 Comments
WEB ACCOUNTS belonging to Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles were defaced over the weekend with links to a spreadsheet that apparently revealed data about customers of the Bitcoin exchange.
A blog post with a telling URL that includes the words "hack", "database", "revealed" and "from mark karpeless, " has since been removed, but this weekend it offered a link to the database leak and an accusation that the Mt Gox CEO was misleading customers.
A Reddit post with the same headline has also been removed, but users have preserved it and saved it online at websites including Pastebin.
The 716MB document was accompanied by a message. "It's time that [Mt Gox] got the Bitcoin [community's] wrath instead of Bitcoin Community getting Goxed. This release would have been sooner, but in spirit of responsible disclosure and making sure all of ducks were in a row, it took a few days longer than [we] would have liked to verify the data," it said.
"Included in this download you will find relevant database dumps, csv exports, specialized tools, and some highlighted summaries compiled from data. Keeping in line with fucking Gox alone, no user database dumps have been included. Repost and share this info before it's gone. Lots of people, including us, lost money and coins."
The document shows a total Bitcoin inventory count of 951,116, which is more than the number reported by Mt Gox and could suggest that not all Bitcoins have been lost.
Mt Gox has not commented on this, but it has already said it will do its talking in the courts , and released a warning about reports of spam messages being sent to users (PDF).
"Spam Warning letter. It has come to our attention that Spam/Phishing emails looking as if MtGox was the sender are being sent to our users. These emails have not been sent by us and should be phishing emails," it said.
"Please be aware that MtGox Co., Ltd does not request personal information by email. We highly recommend not to respond to these emails. Further updates concerning the procedure of filing of claims will be posted on the MtGox website."
For its part, Reddit said that it had removed the parts of the post that were against its policies .
"Please refrain from posting database leaks from MtGox. As they were obtained by illegitimate means, they violate the rediquette and will be removed," it said.
"Discussing the leaks is not against the rules, as long as the post itself doesn't break other rules. By all means, have a discussion, but please be respectful of the law, subreddit rules and the rediquette."
Commenters are torn between anger and outrage and the belief that the document is overstated. The top comment said that the data proves nothing . "This has to be the stupidest 'leak' I've seen in my life," read one response.
"OF COURSE their internal systems will show they have the coins, but these are not real coins, these are just numbers in their [database]."

If the leaked information is valid (and, if valid, accurate, considering Mt. Gox's vulnerability and accounting issues), it reports a sum of 951,116.21905382 Bitcoins deposited by users. During a news conference in Japan, Karpeles claimed 850,000 Bitcoins (worth around $549 million at current prices) had disappeared due to "weaknesses in the system," while bankruptcy filings claimed a debt of $63.6 million. How many Bitcoins were really left in the vault, what happened to the rest and whether or not account holders will ever get their currency back is still unknown.
Forbes points out a (now deleted) forum post that offered a 20GB Mt. Gox database file for sale at a price of 100 Bitcoins. The poster claimed it holds personal details and even passport scans of the site's users, which only adds to the concerns of anyone who had an account before the exchange shut down last month . Meanwhile, Bitcoin watchers have noticed $113 million in coins linked to Mt. Gox accounts moving through the blockchain (check out our Primed article to find out how mining and transaction verifications work) recently, which Coindesk suggests could be preparation to use them "for a high volume of transactions."

Bitcoin exchange MtGox faced massive hacker offensives last   month, coming under some 150,000 DDoS attacks per second for   several days ahead of its spectacular failure, a report said   Sunday.
The Tokyo-based exchange, which filed for bankruptcy protection   in February and admitted that it has lost half a billion dollars   in the digital currency, has come under serious cyber-attacks in   particular since around February 7, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
While MtGox faced hacker attempts to steal Bitcoins, the exchange   also confronted massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS)   attacks, crippling its systems, the newspaper said without naming   its sources.
Under DDoS attacks, hackers hijack multiple computers to send a   flood of data to the target, crippling its computer system.
The attacks on MtGox lasted for several days and many Bitcoins   were stolen, the Yomiuri said.
MtGox's lawyers said 750,000 Bitcoins belonging to the firm's   customers had gone missing, along with around 100,000 units that   the company owned.
Unlike traditional currencies backed by central banks, Bitcoin is   generated by complex chains of interactions among a huge network   of computers around the planet.
After trading for cents per Bitcoin for the first two years of   its existence, it began a frenzied climb in 2011 that took it to   $40 a coin in late 2012 and $1,100 last year, before falling off   to the current $610 level.
Its relative anonymity and lack of regulation has been attacked   by critics who fear it could be used to finance organised crime   or terrorism.
US Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen has said the Fed had no   powers over a currency that only exists virtually with no central   authority behind it. Several countries, including Russia and   China, have heavily restricted how Bitcoin can be used.
Japanese officials have said they were closely monitoring MtGox's   bankruptcy proceedings, as they try to get a handle on how and   why the exchange imploded.

Bitcoin Q&A
What are bitcoins?
Bitcoin is a decentralized, completely digital currency that can be traded directly between two individuals, and is not regulated by governments or a central authority. Each bitcoin is a piece of computer code. There are currently 11 million bitcoins in existence, and additional bitcoins can be  mined  by solving complex mathematical algorithms. However, the anonymous creator of bitcoin set a cap on the number of coins that can be mined   21 million. This number is expected to be reached in the year 2140.
Aren't they used to buy drugs and evade taxes?
Bitcoins are traded directly, which means that users are not required to give identifying information to banks or regulators. Although a record of all bitcoin transactions does exist publicly, it does not have identifying information of individuals. This has given bitcoin a reputation as the cash of the Internet, and like cash, the currency is sometimes used for immoral or illegal purchases. However, it is also used to purchase everyday items like cars, food and clothes, and merchants can keep track of bitcoin transactions and pay taxes on them just as they would for cash transactions.
How can I get bitcoins?
You can  mine  them online, which involves complex computer coding and math. You can buy them directly using traditional currency (at an ATM or through an exchange). Or, you can trade with other people (for example, sell your car and get paid in bitcoin).
OK, but how do I actually use them?
Bitcoins are stored in an  electronic wallet  on a computer or smart phone. The currency can be bought using traditional currencies online. To make a purchase using bitcoin you can scan a QR code or use tap to pay (for in-person transactions) or use an online wallet to purchase goods on the Internet.
Where can I spend bitcoins?
Bitcoins can be spent nearly anywhere. Major retailors, including overstock.com, are increasingly accepting bitcoins, and websites such as gyft.com allow people to purchase giftcards to mainstream stores using the currency. They can also be traded directly between bitcoin users. In addition, local retailers and restaurants in the state are starting to accept bitcoins.
How much is a bitcoin worth?
There is a lot of fluctuation with bitcoin value. As of press time, one bitcoin was worth $649.30, according to preev.com. Each bitcoin can be divided up, currently up to 8 decimal points, allowing people to purchase items in increments smaller than full bitcoins. There are no official names for each division since no one is governing the currency.

Honda Restructures: Accavitti to Lead Acura; Conrad to Oversee Honda
American Honda Will Now Be Separated by Brand, Rather Than Function
By Ryan Beene . Published on
March 10, 2014
.
Most Popular
American Honda has reassigned marketing boss Mike Accavitti to lead the Acura brand amid a restructuring of the automaker's North American operation that will group marketing and sales functions under separate divisions for the Honda and Acura brands.
Michael Accavitti
Mr. Accavitti, currently in charge of marketing and product planning as senior VP-automobile operations at American Honda, will add the newly created role of general manager of the new Acura Division. In that role, he will oversee all sales, marketing and parts and service operation for the Acura brand in North America, while ceding official product-planning duties and oversight of national marketing for the Honda brand.
Meanwhile, Acura sales boss Jeff Conrad will be promoted to senior VP at American Honda and will take over all sales and marketing efforts for the Honda brand as general manager of the newly created Honda Division.
The Honda and Acura divisions will be housed under a single operation, to be called American Honda Auto Division, led by current American Honda sales boss John Mendel. Both Mr. Conrad and Mr. Accavitti will report to Mr. Mendel.
The changes are effective April 1, the start of Honda's next fiscal year.
Jeff Conrad
Previously, American Honda separated key operations by function, rather than by brand. For example, Accavitti oversees product planning and national marketing in his current role for both Honda and Acura, while regional marketing initiatives were handled by American Honda's sales division led by Mendel.
"The goal is really to accelerate the sales growth we've had with both Honda and Acura through a more cohesive type of strategy that we think will bring greater focus," to each brand, Mr. Mendel said in a conference call earlier today with reporters.
"This is going to group major activities for the Honda and Acura brands under dedicated brand leaders, allowing us to respond to the marketplace, focus on the customer and really do so with greater speed and efficiency," Mr. Mendel said.

Honda splits Acura into its own division to revitalize brand
The 10 worst cars sold in America
Jerry Hirsch
Working to shore up its upscale Acura brand, Honda Motor Co. plans to split its sales and marketing efforts into separate divisions in the U.S.
Honda is looking to punch some energy into Acura, which has lagged its bigger Honda sibling in sales growth and has struggled to carve out a strong image. Acura sold 165,000 vehicles in the U.S. last year, down considerably from the peak of 209,610 it sold in 2005.
Industry veteran Michael Accavitti will become senior vice president and general manager of the Acura Division, the Japanese automaker said Monday. He previously headed national marketing of both the Honda and Acura brands. Jeff Conrad will become senior vice president and general manager of the Honda Division. 
While Acura packs its vehicles with technology equal to any of the luxury makes, it has struggled to convince consumers that it is on the same playing field with brands such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi and Lexus, said Stephanie Brinley, an analyst at IHS Automotive.
 The parts seem to be there, they just haven t found the secret sauce,  Brinley said.  There s not a lot of panache or excitement. 
It wasn t always that way. Acura s initial sedans, the Legend and smaller Integra were well received when they were introduced in the late 1980s.
But successive sedans haven t matched up  and they have struggled to communicate a solid image,  Brinley said.
That s left Acura as more of a sport-utility vehicle company. Just two SUVs, the MDX and RDX, accounted for almost 60% of the brand s sales last year.
Styling also has held Acura back, gyrating from conservative to outrageous  and neither has worked particularly well,  said Jack Nerad, an analyst at auto information company Kelley Blue Book .
 They need a model or two with great exterior styling that can change people s perceptions about the brand,  Nerad said.
The new structure demonstrates that Honda is prepared to devote the resources necessary to  revitalize  Acura, said John Mendel, executive vice president of American Honda Motor Co., who will oversee both brands.
 This move obviously reflects the deep commitment we have for the future of Acura,  Mendel said.
 We have done a good job with the SUVs but we have struggled with the sedans,  Mendel said.  There is a lot of recognition that Acura could be and should be a much stronger brand than it is today. 
In addition to separating the two brands, Honda also has established the Acura Business Planning Office, which will set the global direction for Acura products. Mendel said Erik Berkman, currently president of Honda R&D Americas, will become an executive vice president of Honda North America with responsibility for the new Acura Business Planning Office.
Earlier this year, Honda said it would discontinue two sedans, the TL and the TSX. It will replace them with the new TLX sedan this summer. The new model will slot between the compact ILX sedan and the full-size RLX sedan in a simplified lineup.
The base model will use a direct-injected, 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. Expect horsepower and torque figures to be north of 200. This engine will be paired with an all-new eight-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and will be available only with front-wheel-drive.
The optional engine will be a direct-injected 3.5-liter V-6 with a nine-speed automatic transmission.
Pricing hasn t been announced, but is expected to be close to the $31,530 starting price of the outgoing TSX. Like the TL it replaces, the 2015 TLX will be built in Acura s Marysville, Ohio, plant.

Honda Makes Acura a Stand-Alone Division to Spur Sales
Alan Ohnsman
Honda Motor Co., making good on plans to focus more on the image of its Acura brand, is setting it up as a division within the company for the first time with dedicated management, marketing and other resources.
The first premium car brand from an Asian automaker will be known as the Acura Division starting April 1 and be led by U.S. Senior Vice President Mike Accavitti, the company said in a statement yesterday. The company s namesake Honda Division will be led by Jeff Conrad, and both he and Accavitti will report to U.S. Executive Vice President John Mendel.
 American Honda automotive operations have long been separated by function rather than by brand,  Mendel said on a conference call.  This is a very significant step as it is the first time we have had a separate and exclusive division for the Acura brand. So this move obviously reflects the deep commitment we have for the future of Acura. 
The company since last year has acknowledged a need to shake up its premium brand, which arrived in the U.S. years before Toyota Motor Corp. s higher-volume Lexus luxury unit. In December, Tetsuo Iwamura, Honda s executive vice president and current North American chief, said fixing Acura, particularly its sedan line, was a top priority for the Tokyo-based company.
The plan for an Acura division follows Honda s announcement last month that it s forming an Acura Business Planning Office , which starts April 1, to be led by Erik Berkman, the company s highest-ranking U.S. engineer. Berkman, who led development of one of Acura s biggest recent hits, the 2004 TL sedan, will oversee product strategy and development, Honda said.
Berkman s Record
Improving the Acura line in the U.S., the brand s home market, is essential for it to become more of a global player, said Michael Robinet, managing director at consultant IHS Automotive.
 The U.S. market is critical, because it drives their activity from a global perspective,  he said.  There s a real need to differentiate the vehicles from a technology perspective, the powertrain and at the customer-service level. 
Berkman s TL helped push Acura to record U.S. sales in 2005 of 209,610 cars and SUVs. In 2013, a decline in Acura sedan sales kept Honda from a combined volume record, with Acura delivering 165,436 vehicles, 21 percent off its peak.
A potential change with the creation of separate Honda and Acura divisions may be dedicated product-development budgets, Mendel said.
 When you have someone with the background strength of an Erik Berkman fighting the fight daily for allocation of funds, you ve got a pretty strong case,  he said.  We re looking at how that breaks out and what it is, but that is one of the potential benefits of this going forward. 
Mixed Record
Honda has a mixed track record with Acura, said Matthew Stover, an equity analyst with Guggenheim Securities in Boston who has a neutral rating on the company.
Too many Acura models  were better than the Honda alternative, but less convincing when slated against the more substantive competitors in the market,  Stover said. The new strategy  forces more commitment and focus, which is necessary in what is a very profitable but extremely competitive market segment,  he said.
Acura has been on a  wandering road  at times, in terms of image and sales, Mendel said. At Honda s highest level, there s a strong desire to end that, he said.
 There is a greater recognition that we need dedicated resources and a dedicated organization to pull that through,  Mendel said.
Being first the first Asian luxury brand in the U.S. wasn t enough to keep Acura in a top position, said Jack Nerad, an industry analyst for Kelley Blue Book in Irvine, California.
Beyond Rational
 Sometimes being a fast-follower is better than being a leader. Lexus specifically profited by observing Acura s approach and doing some things differently,  Nerad said. Among these was adding a large, V-8 engine sedan, something Honda balked at, he said.
 Acura would never come out with a big, rear-wheel-drive, 8-cylinder sedan,  Nerad said.  Sometimes, the engineering prowess at Honda maybe gets in the way of their ability to deal with things beyond the rational. And luxury goes beyond the rational. 
Honda s American depositary receipts fell 1.5 percent to $36.57 yesterday in New York. The company s U.S. sales unit is in Torrance, California, and its North American headquarters are in Marysville, Ohio.

Not a week goes by without new concepts of the next iPhone getting shared on the web.
Based on recent speculation about the device, British designer Sam Beckett has created a smartphone that has a chance to become reality.
The new phone could be called iPhone Air and it may be thinner but wider. Beckett chose this name as he made the concept 7 mm thick, which is 0.6 mm smaller than the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S, but also 8% larger than its predecessor.
This iPhone concept has a 4.7-inch sapphire crystal display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution, with 468 pixel-per-inch (PPI).
 Some extra space could be potentially utilized by reducing the width of the side bezels and by also slimming down the top and bottom of the phone frame too,  the designer wrote on The Verge forums .
The photo sensor is upgraded from 8 to 10 megapixels and an aperture of f/1.8.
Other features include an A8 chip and a fingerprint sensor.

Concept Video Tips 4.7-Inch iPhone 6 'Air'
Concept Video Tips 4.7-Inch iPhone 6 'Air'
10 Comments
Designer Sam Beckett produced an impressively realistic concept video for what he calls the "iPhone Air."
Want a sneak peek at Apple's iPhone 6? Sure you do, but, sadly, you're going to have to wait a while before Cupertino officially lifts the curtain on its next-generation handset.
But don't fret too much. If you're fiending for a look at the next iPhone, we have something that might hold you over for a bit. Designer Sam Beckett over the weekend released an impressively realistic concept video on The Verge forums showing what he calls the "iPhone Air."
The device Beckett envisioned sports a 4.7-inch sapphire crystal display with a resolution of 1920 by 1080, and 468 pixels per inch, up from 326ppi in the iPhone 5s . The bezels have been scaled down so there's practically no frame around the screen. Beckett also predicts that the next iPhone will have a 10-megapixel camera with an increased aperture of f/1.8 and a faster A8 chip.
"I wanted to keep the core design of the iPhone very much inline with what customers expect from Apple," Beckett wrote. "I have given the device the title 'iPhone Air' because Apple has demonstrated that they think the iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5s and 5c) and I believe more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product lines."
While the video is fun to look at, viewers should take it with a huge grain of salt. It is, of course, just one person's idea of what the phone may look like, and has not been endorsed by Apple.
Still, the video draws on a number of possibly legitimate rumors that have been making the rounds. Take a look for yourself and let us know what you think of the fictitious iPhone Air.

Here s the next iPhone, from a designer with an eerily accurate prediction history
March 11, 20148:52am
ALEXIS KLEINMANHuffington Post
THIS may not be the new iPhone you want, but it could be the new iPhone that you get.
The next iPhone will not be clear (sorry) and it will not have a curved screen (not sorry). It may, however, be a little thinner, lighter and have a slightly larger screen.
The concept comes from British graphic designer Sam Beckett, who has created some impressively accurate iPhone concepts in the past.
Beckett predicts that the iPhone Air will have a 4.7-inch display (the iPhone 5S has a 4-inch display), created by making the phone 8 per cent larger and reducing the side bezels. The concept iPhone Air is also 9 per cent thinner than the 5S.
In 2012 Beckett, who works for an app developer, made an iPhone 5 concept video that was both accurate and ahead of its time. In the video, he correctly predicts some things about the iPhone 5, like the new dock connector and larger display, and he even predicts some aspects of the iPhone 5S and iOS 7, like the fingerprint scanner and the control centre.
Beckett says he believes that the next iPhone will be called the Air, not the 6 because  Apple has demonstrated that they think the iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5S and 5C)  and he feels that  more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product lines. 
As of right now, Apple has no public plans to release a new iPhone, but the company tends to announce new iPhones in the fall of each year, so there s still a lot of time to dream up the next iPhone.

In anticipation for the release of Apple's latest iteration of its flagship smartphone, the iPhone 6, designer Sam Beckett has put together a concept video of what we can expect from the new device.
Dubbing it, the iPhone Air, Beckett's video is based on the rumored specifications of Apple's new gadget. Beckett's concept sports a 4.7-inch display, with 1920 x 1080 resolution and 468ppi. This is a 17 percent increase in screen size from the iPhone 5S, with 68 percent more pixels.
"I wanted to keep the core design of the iPhone very much inline with what customers expect from Apple," says Beckett on The Verge . "I have given the device the title 'iPhone Air' because Apple has demonstrated that they think the iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5S and 5C) and I believe more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product lines."

Beckett's vision for the device also has it 8 percent larger than the previous iteration, and slightly slimmer at 7mm. The smartphone also features a Sapphire Crystal display (rumored to replace the old Gorilla Glass), an improved 10-megapixel camera, and a faster Apple A8 chip.
The iPhone 6 is one of several devices Apple is expected to launch this year. There is also the highly anticipated iPad Air 2, as well as the iWatch. While no official announcements have been made, analysts believe that consumers can expect to see the iPhone 6 on store shelves no later than September.

The iPhone 6 release rumors are ramping up and that means concept and design videos floating across the internet. An iPhone 6 concept video from Sam Beckett of The Verge suggests a potential direction for Apple, an iPhone Air.
Beckett created some internet buzz with the video as his suggested iPhone Air brought together many of the iPhone 6 release rumors that have been scattered across the internet. Probably the biggest rumor to date has to do with screen size and the durability of the retina display on the iPhone 6 . Apple is in tweaking mode on the iPhone, which could eventually spell trouble for them in an increasingly saturated smartphone market . One thing that Apple does well however, is listen to their consumers and make relevant design changes.
One of the biggest concerns with the iPhone 5S release was that there was still more Apple could do with screen size. This iPhone 6 concept video suggests that Apple may increase the screen size by as much as 17 percent and increasing the number of pixels by 68 percent. A thinner design has been part of the thinking in line with the iPad Air direction that Apple has taken. There is some thinking that Apple will only have an iPad Air release this year and not another iPad Mini.
Some screen suggestions for the iPhone 6 release have shown a complete elimination of visible edges on the next edition of Apple s flagship phone. While this design is highly unlikely, the concept video by Beckett does show a more minimalist design than the iPhone 5S. Screen size rumors are not the only thing Apple buyers are interested in. In a fast paced, constantly changing market, iPhone users wanted more speed and quicker processing capabilities. The iPad has already lost considerable ground in the world of tablets and Apple doesn t want to see the same thing for their phone.
There has been a lot of discussion surrounding the development of the A8 chip, to be utilized in the iPhone 6 release. Apparently, Samsung has been cut out of production and now the Tawainese group TSMC is primarily manufacturing the chip for Apple. It seems the A8 and Sapphire glass screen will be the big sellers on the iPhone 6.
So when can data consuming iPhone users expect the next generation to be available on the market? According to most recent speculation, the iPhone 6 release date could come sometime in late Summer.

- iPhone 6 "Air" by FuseChicken
A massive iPhone 6 launch could push up the release date schedule for the upcoming Apple flagship, according to a new report by Chinese publication Commercial Times.
Apple is reportedly planning to kickoff its biggest iPhone launch yet in 2014, with Foxconn expecting 90 million iPhone 6 orders this year. According to the publication, a Citigroup Global Markets analyst said that the sixth-generation Apple smartphone will boost the tech giant's smartphone shipments 23% in 2014, coming off of a 13% increase last year. The analyst added that global smartphone shipments will rise 28% this year, which would be a 12% slower growth rate year-over-year.
As BGR notes, if the 90 million orders number is accurate, the iPhone 6 will likely release ahead of Apple's September schedule, which has been previously rumored to be as early as May.
A recent report on the iPhone 6's processor, likely the Apple A8, suggested that TSMC will take on "most" of the orders , with production kicking off earlier than previous years suggesting a release in the third quarter of 2014.
The iPhone 6 will also feature a nearly bezel-less display, according to new alleged photos  of the upcoming Apple smartphone.
The next flagship iPhone was leaked in a several images, with one showing off the sixth-generation's front panel alongside the iPhone 4S and iPhone 5/5S (pictured left to right), indicating that the new iPhone features thinner bezels than its predecessors.
Another specs rumor suggests the smartphone will pack an 8-megapixel camera with an apeture size of f/2.0 for better low-light photos. The iPhone 5 packs a f/2.4 and the current flagship 5S has a f/2.2. The GforGames report, which cites an insider, added that the iPhone 6 camera includes sport optical image stabilization and a Sony-manufactured CMOS sensor.
The report contradicts a previous claim from  China's IT168 that the flagship smartphone will pack a 10-megapixel camera with a f/1.8 aperture. It added that the smartphone's hybird IR filter will be replaced with a resin filter produced by Japanese manufacturer JSR. As MacLife notes, JSR's filters are lighter and thinner than IR filters, allowing for "cleaner" images due to the resin's ability to "minimize color shifts in cameras with CMOS filers."
Another recent specs report on the iPhone 6's display doesn't involve the integration of sapphire glass, but instead suggests the upcoming Apple iPhone will be a game-changer for LCD smartphones.
The iPhone 6, rumored for 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models, will offer the same Quantum Dot technology used in the stunning Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7, "but with an Apple twist," Forbes reports.
Haydn Shaughnessy writes that the next-generation Apple smartphone will focus on offering a wider gamut of color than the Fire does, something he believes Amazon compromised when creating the tablet's display "in favor of color reproduction accuracy."
According to the report, Apple will use Nanosys, a company that owns 300 patents in Quantum Dot technology, and has been rumored to be working with Apple since December. Shaughnessy added that Nanosys CEO Jason Hartlove told him last week that the first QD smartphone will launch by "mid-year," which matches up with the May-June expectations for the iPhone 6.
Shaughnessy also points to four recently published Apple patent filings for Quantum Dot specs tech, which suggests that they were filed about 18 months ago and "began to work on QD significantly in advance of that."
While the report is mostly based on speculation for now, it's certainly a compelling one.

4.7-Inch 'iPhone Air' Shown Off In New Concept Video
Monday March 10, 2014 11:25 AM PDT by Juli Clover
The upcoming iPhone 6 has been incorporated into a new concept video by designer Sam Beckett, which was initially posted to The Verge forums . According to the dimensions Beckett provides, his "iPhone Air" concept includes a 4.7-inch display, a 1920 by 1080 resolution and 468 pixels per inch.
Beckett's concept is 8 percent larger than the iPhone 5s and 9 percent thinner. The slimmer profile is in line with previous iPhone 6 rumors, which have suggested Apple has improved its backlighting technology to allow for thinner devices.
The phone is only 8% larger than the existing iPhone 5S, this increase is to accommodate the larger screen. Some extra space could be potentially utilised by reducing the width of the side bezels and by also slimming down the top and bottom of the phone frame too. The depth of the iPhone Air is 7mm, coming in 0.6mm smaller than it's predecessor. This modest reduction in the device depth and larger increase in the width and height could help create a bigger space for the battery and other components.
Like several other iPhone 6 concepts, Beckett's design keeps the same general size and shape of the existing iPhone 5s while doing away with thick side bezels. The design incorporates thinner side bezels with a sapphire crystal display , both features the phone is rumored to include.
Beckett also draws on a number of other rumors for the video, suggesting the iPhone 6 will include a 10-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/1.8 and a faster A8 chip, which is reportedly already in production with TSMC.
As with any concept, it is unclear if these ideas and rumors will make it into the next-generation iPhone, but the video does imagine how a larger iPhone could possibly look. Apple is said to be developing two larger iPhones for release in 2014, one near 4.7 inches and one quite a bit larger at approximately 5.5 inches.

This holographic iPhone 6 concept could change everything
It's not the first iPhone 6 concept, or even the first holographic phone concept. But it is the first time we've seen both ideas combined into one, and the result is causing serious drool-induced dehydration.
@ericcmack

Over the years, I've taken some heat for saying that the iPhone jumped the shark years ago or predicting that the iPhone 6 will be more run of the mill than a runaway hit. So far, I've yet to see anything on the horizon that will prompt me to eat those words someday soon, except maybe if this crazy holographic iPhone 6 concept miraculously came to market.
Put together by yet another Italian design outfit -- this time the Set Solution -- the concept imagines a new iPhone with holographic projectors on the side that allow the user to interact with projected screens alongside the physical display. Also demonstrated is how a vertically projected hologram might be used for applications like 3D gaming.

What's coming in the iPhone 6? This concept video from Apple fan Sam Beckett has all the major rumors,   and his own idea about what it will look like. 
The design in Beckett's mind is a combination of the iPhone 4 and   the iPhone 5. It looks nice, but we're expecting the iPhone 6 to   look more like an iPad Mini, or iPad Air, with a rounded backing.   We could be wrong, though.
Anyway, here's the video:

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch iPhone 6 later this year, and designer Sam Beckett has come up with a concept of an  iPhone Air,  which might be similar to the one Apple has planned to launch. The concept iPhone is just 8% bigger than the iPhone 5S, but the screen is 17% larger with 68% more pixels.
In the concept design, reported by The Verge , Beckett has kept the screen of the iPhone at 4.7 inches with resolution of 1920 1080 pixels or 468 ppi.
iPhone 6 concept similar to iPhone 5S
Beckett believe that some extra space could be utilized by thinning the bezels on the side, and also by cutting down the top and bottom of the phone frame. The iPhone Air as designed by Beckett is 7mm, which is 0.6 mm thinner than its forerunner.
The concept also shows the use of sapphire crystal instead of Corning Gorilla glass, a 10 megapixel camera and a faster A8 chip.  The concept by Beckett is very much similar to the iPhone 5S, which indicates that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be working on the similar line for the iPhone 6.
Explaining the designs, Beckett said that the concept iPhone is similar to the customer s expectation from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). He said that some changes have been made in the design because Apple guys think that the  iPhone is a mature enough device to warrant two versions (5S and 5C) and I believe more distinctive branding, much like the iPad Mini and Air will help to reinforce the two product lines. 
Apple on hiring spree
In order to design new devices, including the iPhone 6, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is hiring new engineers and supply chain managers in China and Taiwan. The company is gearing up its product development and planning to launch newer devices.
According to the  Wall Street Journal , the iPhone maker is poaching engineers from companies like HTC Corp and other Taiwanese tech firms to build up teams in Shanghai and Taipei. Apple is rumored to come up with two larger screen iPhones for this year. According to the analysts, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on releasing more devices similar to competitors like Samsung.
The much talked about variants of the iPhone 6 are expected have 4 inch and 5 inches screen display, Bezel free design, remote user interface and sapphire glass.

Apple Inc. has not revealed the release date of its flagship smartphone, iPhone 6 but speculations around the device keeps surfacing one after the other. And now, a new concept video of the next-generation smartphone that resembles iPad Mini and iPad Air has hit online.
The mock up design of iPhone 6, which many say would be called iPhone Air, prepared by designer Sam Beckett in his 1.37 minute long video, shows a much thinner smartphone with a bigger screen and nine percent thinner than its predecessor. The video also shows the device with 4.7 display (1920x1080, 468ppi) and 10-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/1.8.
"This is an idependently animated video for the purposes of visualising potential future hardware concepts," reads the disclaimer of the video.
Apple Inc. has not revealed the looks of its upcoming flagship smartphone but gadget lovers seem to love the mock up design as many viewers of the YouTube video commented positively.
"Have to admit that this looks pretty damn nice," commented Tony Robinson.
"I could totally see Apple using this or a similar concept for the iPhone 6. Nicely done!" wrote Don McAllister.
"This would have been a bit better if the back had a curved bevel edge like the iPads and iPod touch. I still liked it better than other concepts, though," commented CaptainKittyLitter.
With a rounded look, the iPhone 6 looks like iPad Mini and iPad Air in Sam Beckett's concept video. However, it's not known if the Cupertino giant will incorporate the designs shown in the video.
Conflicting reports have been doing the rounds on the release date of the device with some arguing that it would be unveiled at the WWDC event in June while others say the unveiling would happen only in September.
Several reports have claimed that iPhone 6 would have screen made of sapphire crystal glass and Apple has filed for patents like "Audio call screening for hosted voicemail systems," "Computer User Interface System and Methods," and "Systems and Methods for Preventing Light Guide Plate Scratching Artifacts," with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office , suggestting that it could be incorporated in its new device.
iPhone 6 is expected to sport a 4.7/4.8' or 5.5' display with a 1920x1080p (440ppi), or a 2272 1280 (510ppi), powered by A8 chip (64-bit) and run on iOS 7.2. It is also expected to have a 1,800mAh battery, according to South Korean brokerage KDB Daewoo Securities .

It seems like the inevitable next step for the iPhone line, given the warm reception the iPad Air received at launch. But should the iPhone 6 land taking much of its inspiration from Apple's updated tablet design, it sure would be boring.
Designer Sam Beckett has put together the convincing concept video above, with the fantasy handset sporting a 17 per cent larger display than that of the 5S, pumping out a 1920 x 1080p resolution to its 4.7-inch screen. 7mm thick (0.6mm thinner than the iPhone 5S), Beckett taps into the regularly-circulating rumour that the next Apple phone will use sturdy sapphire crystal in its display rather than Corning Gorilla Glass, as well as a 10MP camera and A8 chip.
It's all very believable, but all rather prosaic too -- the perfect, incremental non-upgrade, as Apple cynics would have it. And that's no slight against Beckett's work, which is excellent, but more on the fact that such minor changes could easily, feasibly be the real deal. It does make you wonder where exactly the iPhone line can go next, highlighting the fact that services, rather than hardware, will make or break the top-tier mobile devices of the future.

The iPhone 6 continues to be a focal point for the technology world, with some rumors becoming generally expected and others remaining mere fantasies. Most agree that the handset will be a bit larger than previous models, possibly up to 4.7 inches in size.
iPhone 6 could have an edge to edge screen
Recently there were some allegedly leaked photos of the iPhone 6 screen, but Techno Buffalo, in a video picked up by Huffington Post , explains why it probably isn t the real iPhone 6 screen. He notes, as have others, that the home button cutout wasn t centered. The screen does show an edge-to-edge display though, and he suggests that perhaps the component is from a prototype.
Mixed in with all the rumors, we ve seen plenty of iPhone 6 concepts, including a new iPhone Air one developed by Sam Beckett and highlighted by The Next Web . That one covers many of the rumors, like the larger screen, so it could be pretty close to what the handset ends up looking like.
iPhone 6 concepts for dreamers
But we also have some more fun ones like a concept video which shows the iPhone 6 with a holographic projector, which comes from design studio SET Solution and was picked up by Uswitch . This is a different video than the one which surfaced last year , showing a holographic keyboard and what basically looked like a holographic computer screen.
Of course Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fans should note that this concept is so wild that it s unlikely we will ever see anything like this from the technology giant. The projectors are embedded on both sides of the handset, giving it extra virtual screens when it is placed on a flat surface. The creators suggest that it could even offer  real 3D video games  using the screen which pops up vertically.
To control the holographic screens, users just use finger gestures. They can also toss their various screens around and position the as they like. The iPhone 6 in chis concept also features an edge to edge display.

A new concept video has surfaced for the mythical iPhone Air. The design, put together by Sam Beckett , takes the typical iterations you find between iPhone versions these days and runs it through an iPhone Air concept machine.
What s the phone look like? Well, an iPhone 5S, which is counter to Apple s typical release schedule. Lately it s been a new design, followed by an iterative iPhone with an  S  tag, followed by a new iPhone type of schedule. That puts us square into brand spanking new iPhone territory this time around.
Under the hood though the concept seems on point for an  air  iPhone:   I decided that 4.7  was an ideal size, supporting a resolution of 1920 1080, that s 468ppi (up from 326ppi in the iPhone 5S)  I believe the camera sensor will be updated, perhaps to a 10-megapixel sensor and an increased aperture of f/1.8. Other features expected are a faster and more efficient A8 chip. 
All in all it s a realistic rendering without too many liberties taken at the expense of previous Apple iPhones. This is probably the closest thing to a legitimate concept that we ve seen to date.

Is This What The New Apple iPhone 6 Will Look Like? (video)
9:38 am
By Julian Horsey
Designer Sam Beckett has put together a concept rendering of what he thinks Apple s iPhone 6 might look like when it is unveiled later this year, using leaked specifications that are rumoured to be incorporated into the new iPhone 6 smartphone.
A number of rumours have been circulating regards the design and specifications of the new Apple iPhone 6 including with some indicating the new iPhone 6 will only be 8 percent larger than the current iPhone 5S but will be fitted with a screen that is 17 percent larger offering 68 percent more pixels for users to enjoy.
In his iPhone 6 concept Sam has taken the route of Apple slimming their smartphone to just 7mm and using a 4.7-inch screen sporting a resolution of 1920x1080p offering and impressive 468ppi. Beckett explains :
 I wanted to keep the core design of the iPhone very much inline with what customers expect from Apple.

Some extra space could be potentially utilized by reducing the width of the side bezels and by also slimming down the top and bottom of the phone frame. 
Other features included in the iPhone 6 concept include a faster A8 chip and 10 megapixel camera. However as you might expect nothing has been officially announced by Apple as yet and we will need to wait until later in the year to see if Sam s conceptual iPhone 6 design is close to the mark.

Jaguars unveil plan for world s largest HD LED screens
EverBank Field will be home to the largest HD LED screens in the world.

The Jaguars typically tarp off upper-deck seating at EverBank Field on Sundays during the season to prevent blacking out the games on television.
Since the franchise has struggled to get people through the turnstiles, it has a new approach: enhance the game-day experience. Beginning next season, EverBank Field will be home to the largest HD LED video displays in the world at each end zone.
Each video board will be more than 21,700 square feet of active display area, which is nearly enough to blanket the entire football field when combined.
Per Daktronics.com , who is manufacturing the HD screens:
"The two massive end zone displays will each measure 60 feet high by 362 feet wide and feature a 13HD pixel layout. A goal of these displays was to have three side-by-side HD video images for multiple replay shots and other video content. A section of 60 feet high by 106 feet wide gives them the needed real estate for such a feat, with an extra 44-foot-wide buffer space for graphics and other content.

Enough room for three full HD replays at once.
Four losing seasons in the last five years can't keep these cats down!
The Jacksonville Jaguars have commissioned Daktronics to build the largest LED-lit HD displays in the world for their home turf, EverBank Field.
Two displays are being built, one for each end zone, and both will measure 362 feet wide by 60 feet tall. That's good enough to stretch from goal post to goal post, and both displays combined would completely cover the field.
Why so big? Each display will have room for three 106x60-foot replay scenes, along with a fourth smaller 44x60-foot space for other graphics. The displays will have a "13HD pixel" layout, so even the biggest content package will have a relatively sharp look.
The two end zone panels will be complimented by a suite of other new, smaller displays, including new corner units, new ribbon displays (those strips on the edge of the upper deck at most arenas), and new panels above the stadium tunnels.
Now Jaguars fans will have plenty of distraction from the merciless throttling their team is undoubtedly on the receiving end of.

Construction underway for EverBank Field enhancements
Posted Mar 10, 2014
a
Hunt and Elkins serving as construction manager, Haskell, Daktronics and Populous part of team.
Ground has been broken at EverBank Field in preparation for installation of the largest video boards of their kind in the world. This project also includes the construction of a new interactive fan area in the north end zone that will reflect the spirit of life in Jacksonville. This new fan amenity will feature a flexible elevated plaza of approximately 42,000 square feet. Project completion of the video boards and the fan area is expected in time for the first home game of the 2014 Jacksonville Jaguars preseason.
 As the construction takes shape we can all envision what an impact this will have on EverBank Field and the game day experience,  said Jaguars Owner Shahid Khan,  and that was one of the reasons from the beginning for embarking on this ambitious project. We want EverBank Field to be a world-class destination, and we want to bring energy and attention to Downtown Jacksonville. Our goal is to offer best-in-class amenities and the best in-stadium experience for our fans and for everyone who visits Jacksonville and EverBank Field. 
With these video enhancements, EverBank Field will now display approximately 55,000 square feet of video boards, a 660% increase over last season s 7,200 square feet and the most offered by any NFL stadium. Fans can go to www.jaguars.com/livecam to follow real-time progress of the project.
 We owe our fans and this community nothing less than the best, and these enhancements will be the best,  said Jaguars President Mark Lamping.  These stadium upgrades will drastically change the in-stadium experience and create a truly unique environment that you cannot get at home. This will be an eye-opener and an attention-getter for Jacksonville. 
Hunt + Elkins, a joint venture, is the construction manager for the stadium project. Hunt Construction Group has previously built several sports facilities including Lucas Oil Stadium and University of Phoenix Stadium for football, and Marlins Park, Nationals Park, Busch Stadium and Citi Field for baseball.
Elkins Constructors is a Jacksonville-based construction company, as is Haskell Architects and Engineers, P.A. which is the designer for the scoreboard construction. The Haskell Company will provide structural steel and steel installation services for the scoreboard and north end zone improvements.
 Our company built the stadium for the City of Jacksonville at the inception of the Jaguars, opening in 1995,  said Sid Perkins, Vice President of Field Operations for Hunt Construction Group.  We look forward to another successful opening day and showcasing the skills of our very talented staff. 
Daktronics is creating the video boards, and Haskell is responsible for the project design. Daktronics is in the process of manufacturing the video displays. Each display boasts more than 21,700 square feet of active display area   almost enough to cover the entire field of play when combined.
 We are honored to continue our long-standing relationship with the Jacksonville Jaguars and the City of Jacksonville,  said Mike Kempany, Daktronics sales representative on the project.  Their new game-day experience will be unrivaled as the Jaguars unveil new LED fascia displays throughout the stadium and two of the world s largest high definition video displays.  The Jaguars are proving their commitment to be on the leading edge of video technology and to the fans of Jacksonville.  Daktronics is extremely proud of our ability to offer these high end systems which will set a new benchmark in professional sports. 
 These new cutting-edge video displays and related technological improvements will greatly elevate the fans  visual immersion and will set the standard for in-venue experience,  said Christopher Holmes, AIA, LEED AP, Haskell s Project Design Principal.
 
North end zone interactive fan area
At the north end of the stadium will be a large two-level deck featuring cabana-style seating areas, video screens, bars and two large spa-type wading pools and other water features. There will be sections dedicated to private functions as well as areas open to all fans in the seating bowl. Populous is responsible for the design of the north end zone area.
 As the designers of the original stadium and planned improvements over the years, our focus at Populous has always been on keeping EverBank Field looking to the future by creating an experience that will evolve with Jaguars fans. The north deck expansion is an important step in accomplishing this goal and will enhance game day for everyone from general fans to premium patrons,  said Dennis Wellner, Populous Senior Principal.  The experience for fans using the deck will be incomparable; they will have a variety of new offerings on game day that simply don t exist in other NFL venues.  As a firm, we re appreciative of having a continued role, spanning more than two decades, in creating and exploring future fan amenities at EverBank Field. 
Permanent facilities in the deck area will include men s and women s restrooms, food service space and utility boxes for connection to portable amenities. The connections under construction will provide power, data, water and drains for portable bars and food service for fans.
In addition, sun shades, seating and other amenities will be provided. These provisions will be portable and removable for the installation of temporary seating for special events like the Florida-Georgia game, the Gator Bowl and concerts.
 
Video boards
The two massive end zone displays will each measure 60 feet high by 362 feet wide and feature 13mm HD pixel spacing. The video boards will be capable of showing any combination of live action, instant replays, vivid graphics, colorful animations, up-to-the-minute statistics, scoring information and sponsor advertisements.
Below the north end zone display will be a display measuring nearly 10 feet high by 320 feet wide featuring the same 13mm HD pixel layout.
At the opposite end of the stadium will be two ribbon displays on both levels of fascia in the seating bowl below the south end zone main display. Each ribbon display will feature 15mm HD pixel spacing. The top display, measuring more than 3 feet high by 365 feet wide, is curved to appear the same length as the bottom display, which will measure more than 3 feet high by 295 feet wide.
Each side of the field will feature a ribbon display along the seating fascia, each measuring more than 3 feet high by 573 feet wide and featuring a 15mm HD pixel layout.
Four new displays will replace the existing displays in each corner of the stadium. These new displays will each measure approximately 18 feet high by 32 feet wide and feature a 15mm HD pixel spacing. Two additional displays will be installed above each tunnel at opposite corners of the stadium. These displays will each measure 6 feet high by 24 feet wide and will also feature a 15mm HD pixel layout.
All of these video and ribbon displays will provide the opportunity to present up-to-the-minute statistics, fantasy football updates, out of town scores and other game day information. All displays will incorporate excellent image clarity and contrast, and will provide multiple levels of protection from the elements. The wide angle viewing capability will provide fans with a clear view of the displays from any seat in the stadium.
Daktronics will also be including its powerful Show Control System with this installation. This industry-leading system provides a combination of display control software, world-class video processing, data integration and playback hardware that forms a user-friendly production solution.
 
Steel structure
The new scoreboards will be constructed of structural steel framing with ribbed metal siding and a single ply roof over rigid insulation on metal roof deck. The bowl side of each structure will be the electronic video board. Each new section of scoreboard will be supported by triangular structural steel towers similar to the existing supports. The design will include the electrical service for the video board operation, lighting of the interior spaces and lighting for the signage to be provided on the back side of the scoreboards.
The installation includes power, cabling, sound and a new expanded state of the art scoreboard control room on the west side suite level of the stadium.

BROOKINGS, Mar 10, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The Jacksonville Jaguars have partnered with Daktronics DAKT, +0.32% of Brookings, S.D., to manufacture and install the largest HD LED video displays in the world at each end zone of EverBank Field in Jacksonville, Fla. Each display will be long enough to reach just more than the distance from the goal post in one end zone to the goal post in the other end zone, and each display boasts more than 21,700 square feet of active display area - almost enough to cover the entire field of play when combined.
A photo accompanying this release is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=24007
"As the construction takes shape, we can all envision what an impact this will have on EverBank Field and the game-day experience," said Jaguars Owner Shahid Khan, "and that was one of the reasons from the beginning for embarking on this ambitious project. We want EverBank Field to be a world-class destination, and we want to bring energy and attention to Downtown Jacksonville. Our goal is to offer best-in-class amenities and the best in-stadium experience for our fans and for everyone who visits Jacksonville and EverBank Field."
"We owe our fans and this community nothing less than the best, and these enhancements will be the best," said Jaguars President Mark Lamping. "These stadium upgrades will drastically change the in-stadium experience and create a truly unique environment that you cannot get at home. This will be an eye-opener and an attention-getter for Jacksonville."
The two massive end zone displays will each measure 60 feet high by 362 feet wide and feature a 13HD pixel layout. A goal of these displays was to have three side-by-side HD video images for multiple replay shots and other video content. A section of 60 feet high by 106 feet wide gives them the needed real estate for such a feat, with an extra 44-foot-wide buffer space for graphics and other content.
They are still capable of showing one large image to highlight live video and instant replays and can also be divided into any combination of separate windows to show a variety of vivid graphics, colorful animations, up-to-the-minute statistics, scoring information and sponsor advertisements.
"The collaboration between Daktronics and the Jacksonville Jaguars to manufacture the two largest LED video displays in the world is a testament to the engineering capabilities of our company," said Reece Kurtenbach, CEO, Daktronics. "We are pleased to be able to produce these high-quality video display systems for the Jaguars and EverBank Field; it will create a memorable experience for fans when football season returns."
Below the north end zone display will be a display measuring nearly 10 feet high by 320 feet wide featuring the same 13HD pixel layout.
On the opposite end of the field, there will be two ribbon displays on both levels of fascia in the seating bowl below the south end zone main display. Each ribbon display will feature a 15HD pixel layout. The top display, measuring more than 3 feet high by 365 feet wide, is curved to appear the same length as the bottom display, which will measure more than 3 feet high by 295 feet wide.
Each side of the field will receive a ribbon display along the seating fascia, each measuring more than 3 feet high by 573 feet wide and featuring a 15HD pixel layout.
Four new displays will replace the existing displays in each corner of the stadium. These new displays will each measure approximately 18 feet high by 32 feet wide and feature a 15HD pixel layout.
Two additional displays will be installed above each tunnel at opposite corners of the stadium. These displays will each measure 6 feet high by 24 feet wide and will also feature a 15HD pixel layout.
All of these additional video and ribbon displays will provide the opportunity to showcase sponsors throughout events and provide up-to-the-minute statistics, fantasy football updates and other game information.
All displays will incorporate excellent image clarity and contrast, and will provide multiple levels of protection from the elements. The wide angle viewing capability will provide fans with a clear view of the displays from any seat in the stadium.

Jacksonville Jaguars And Daktronics Get Largest HD LED Video Displays In The World At Stadium
By Edwin Kee on 03/10/2014 06:33 PDT
The Jacksonville Jaguars has teamed up with Daktronics in order to install what is deemed to be the world s largest HD LED video displays at their stadium, where there will be one at each end zone of the EverBank Field. Each display is so long, that they are able to reach beyond the distance from the goal post in one end zone to the goal post in the other end zone, where we are looking (literally) at over 21,700 square feet of active display area, which is nearly enough to actually cover the whole field of play when merged.
Jaguars Owner Shahid Khan shared,  As the construction takes shape, we can all envision what an impact this will have on EverBank Field and the game-day experience, and that was one of the reasons from the beginning for embarking on this ambitious project. We want EverBank Field to be a world-class destination, and we want to bring energy and attention to Downtown Jacksonville. Our goal is to offer best-in-class amenities and the best in-stadium experience for our fans and for everyone who visits Jacksonville and EverBank Field. 
Hopefully the Jacksonville Jaguars will be able to carry on a winning sporting tradition, otherwise all of the future losses will be shown on such a large display for all and sundry to see. I suppose using these displays for something more neutral such as a concert would be much appreciated. [ Press Release ]

New SDK Shows Google Really Wants to Get on Your Body
Google s Android boss says a wearable SDK is coming. Here s hoping it will be more popular than Glass.
March 10, 2014
The emergence of Google Glass made it clear that Google is keen to get into wearable computing, and an announcement yesterday by Android head Sundar Pichai makes it clear that the company doesn t really care how that happens, as long as it still has a hand in the nascent market.
Speaking at the annual South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, Pichai said Google will offer a software development kit in two weeks that will let third-party developers use Android to run their wearable devices. The move is much more likely than Glass to make wearable devices part of the average person s daily life, since it will allow developers to use the SDK to create all kinds of sensor-laden gadgets smart watches, clothing, earrings, whatever on their own timelines and budgets and with their own sense of style (Glass, on the other hand, costs $1,500, is extremely obvious-looking , finnicky, and still not publicly available.)
Google already did this kind of thing once with smartphones: Android arrived in 2008 and was the only OS aside from Apple s iOS that managed to expand and capture a huge chunk of the market. With Google s existing expertise in mobile software and developers  familiarity with Android, a wearable SDK would require relatively little investment for a potentially big payoff if wearable gadgets grow as expected over the next several years (and this makes it even more likely that more developers will try their hand at making wearables, since many are already familiar with Android).
Reportedly , Pichai didn t mention if Google is building any of its own non-Glass wearables with the SDK, but I m willing to bet one of my plastic Android toys that, beyond its experimental contact-lens project computer project , there are some things in the pipeline (a smart watch has long been expected, at least, and could be revealed at the company s next developer conference in June).
Tech Obsessive?

SXSW News: Google looks to boost Android's presence in wearable market
10 March 2014, 9:17 pm EDT By Doug Olenick Tech Times
Google's Sundar Pichai who heads apps, Chrome and Android for the company has announced at the SXSW 2014 that the company will roll out an Android SDK for wearable technology devices. Sounds like a "Big Bang" of wearables is coming. What will Apple do now?  ( Ryanne Lai )

Google will make it easier for third-party developers to create Android-based smartwatches and fitness bands, the company said today at the South by Southwest Conference (SXSW).
Google is a huge player in the wearable device market with its Google Glass product, although that device has garnered almost as much negative press as accolades, since it was released on a test-basis last year.
However, Android has not made much of an impression with smartwatch and fitband makers, but it hopes to correct this situation by releasing a software developers kit (SDK) in about two weeks' time. SDKs give developers all of the technical background needed to properly use the Android operating system in their products, making it easier to create apps.
Sundar Pichai, Google's senior VP of Android, Apps, and Chrome, said he expects the wearables market to develop in a similar fashion as the smartphone market. There have been reports that Google will roll out its own smartwatch later this year.
The move could come just in time, as consumer interest and knowledge of wearables such as smartwatches, fitness bands and smart glasses has reached 52 percent, according to the NPD Group's new "Wearable Technology Study." 
"[Some] 52 percent of consumers say they've heard of wearable technology devices such as smart glasses, smart watches, and wearable fitness tracking devices. Among those aware of the devices, one-in-three say they are likely to buy one of them," the research firm found .
Smartwatches have a somewhat higher level of recognition among consumers than fitness bands, with 36 percent of those surveyed saying they had heard of smartwatches. On the negative side, only 23 percent said they intended to purchase such a device.
Smart glasses awareness is also quite high, due mainly to the excellent level of press received by Google Glass. Among early adopters, smart glass awareness is nearly 50 percent. Making and receiving calls (19 percent), browsing the web (19 percent), and taking photos and videos (19 percent) were most commonly cited by likely buyers as sought-after features, NPD said.
There are still problems that are keeping wearable products from broader adoption, though. NPD analysts noted that people believe smart glasses can easily be broken and that most smartwatches are too large, unattractive and have a short battery life. Fitness bands also suffer from an image problem with consumers citing many of the previously mentioned problems and adding in that they fear they will lose interest in the device.

The Chromecast has become a popular little device. Despite talking about it so much and recommending it endlessly, we can t really claim too much credit for that. But according to Sundar Pichai, head of Android and Chrome, the Chromecast has sold  millions  of devices. No solid number was given, but that s impressive nonetheless.
Even launched in a single market with limited functionality and neutered developer support, the low price and ease of use captivated many. Plug the little dongle into a spare HDMI port and outlet, set it up with your smartphone, and you can suddenly stream supported media from your Android or iOS device wirelessly. The fact that it worked with iOS devices probably helped move units as well.
Recently, Google has opened up the SDK to developers. This has resulted in quite a few apps integrating Chromecast support, offering more streaming options for users. This $35 dongle is far more useful than it ever has been. However, there is still a way to go. With more support and Google s improvements this device can become even more popular. How many of you own a Chromecast? How many of your friends bought one?

Google plans to release an Android software developer kit for wearables
Google's Android is the most widely used smartphone OS, and it now wants to power wearables as well.
By Ananth Baliga   |   March 10, 2014 at 4:30 PM

AUSTIN, Texas, March 10 (UPI) -- Google will launch an Android developers kit for wearables, according to Sundar Pichai, head of Android and Chrome, while speaking at the SXSW conference Monday.
While Pichai did not say whether Google itself will develop wearables, he did say that the kit will help developers create wearable devices that run on Android. Google, according to Pichai, is presently focused on looking at wearables from a "platform level," positioning the company as a stakeholder in wearable technology without having to build their own wearables.
Pichai said that he sees similarities between the smartphone ecosystem and the wearable system. While smartphones are becoming smaller and more powerful computers, wearables are becoming a nexuses of an array of sensors.
He sees Google being able to provide a way to standardize how these sensors interact with Android, which will save many developers the hassle of having to create custom operating systems.
"We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together," Pichai said. "They need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together."
Pichai stated that Google's focus still remains on smartphones -- be it the sub-$100 phone or a premium smartphone -- and that the company is looking for ways to connect to the next billion users.
Apple has made its foray into the auto industry with CarPlay, and Pichai noted that many people will choose to stick to Apple's iOS. But he likened this approach to entering a hotel room and realizing the in-room stereo system only works iOS devices.
"They're probably losing at least half of their users," he said.

Computex 2015: Asus ZenWatch 2 could have 4-day battery
AUSTIN Google wants to provide a framework for wearables the same way it has for smartphones and tablets. During a talk at South by Southwest on Sunday, Android head Sundar Pichai said an Android SDK for wearables is coming down the pipeline in two weeks, and will give developers the tools they need to make Android-based smartwatches and fitness trackers.
Pichai said Google thinks of wearables in terms of sensors that need to communicate to be helpful for users.  We want to build an API so these sensors can work together,  he said.
 When we say wearables, we think about it as a much broader conception. [But] that s for partners and developers to figure out. 
Watches and activity trackers are the most obvious wearable categories that developers can begin working on, but Pichai said Google wants to offer an Android framework that goes far beyond traditional form factors.
 When we say wearables, we think about it as a much broader conception,  he said.  [But] that s for partners and developers to figure out. We are thinking about it as software  a jacket one day with sensors. I don t know. 
The wearables SDK follows on the heels of the Android for cars initiative that Google announced at CES earlier this year. The two are related, Pichai said, because Google thinks in terms of a unified software ecosystem. That extends to its new acquisition Nest, too.
 We see an ecosystem for all these devices,  Pichai said.  We want to develop a set of common protocols so they all work together.  
Will Glass soon have a stablemate in Google's wearables line-up? Pichai wasn't telling.
Of course, by releasing an SDK in short order, Google creates an essential feedback loop. In essence, third-party developers can seed Google with helpful data before the company announces any home-brewed wearables of its own .
And you can breathe a sigh of relief, Google+ haters: No Google+ account will be required for your new Android-based wearables to function.
A plethora of possibilities
Will we see Google-branded wearables? Maybe. Pichai said Google has ventured into phone and tablet manufacturing to show partners like Samsung how the ideal device marries hardware and software. But Pichai also said Google doesn t want OEMs to think Google is giving itself an unfair advantage.
 What makes a platform successful is having the discipline to make sure that everything Google can do on top of a platform is something that other people can do as well,  he said.
Pichai extolled the virtues of Android s open nature and pointed to Nokia and Amazon s Android devices as examples of how companies can build on top of the platform without baking in Google s own services though that s also an option. Hardware manufacturers can twist and mold the operating system to the extent that users don t even realize they have an Android device.
Many so-called low-end Android devices were on display at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, but even the sub-$100 phones are increasing in quality, Pichai said.
 There are phones for every segment and the quality of these phones are pretty good,  he said.  The impact of that is huge I think. 
Now that Android phones and tablets are well-covered territory, we re expecting other Google to shift focus to other form factors at its upcoming I/O conference . Pichai predictably hinted at little of what the company will announce in June, but it looks like car tech and wearables are top priority.

Pichai made no mention of whether or not Google itself would be working on its own wearable devices, but did say that the company's focus on the emerging product category would be at "a platform level." This likely means Google will provide the programmable software meant to equip wearable sensors with an operating system (Android), instead of building the wearable devices itself.

"We'll lay out a vision for developers as to how we'll see this market working," Pichai said at the event.
The announcement indicates that Google is putting its stake in the wearables market, which first of all is indicative of its significance as a product category. But beyond that, having an Android SDK for wearables will incentivize developers looking to create brand new devices. That, combined with the unending slew of Android smartphones and tablets means the OS has a good chance of solidifying itself as the go-to platform for a rich, mobile experience.
Even with all this talk of wearable tech, however, Pichar was silent on the matter of Google's own rumored smartwatch. Only time will tell how these two pieces of news will play out.

MOUNTAIN VIEW   Google s plans to release free Android-based software tools for wearable technology will accelerate the delivery of smart watches and similar devices into the mass market within the next year, according to tech analysts.
Jeffrey Hammond, an analyst in Forrester s application development and delivery group, counts four Fitbit activity trackers among his family, along with a Pebble smart watch that his son wears at MIT.
So Hammond believes the rush to wearable technology  is already moving pretty fast. 
But Google s announcement, he said, has the potential to  push wearable technology into mainstream acceptance. It can t do anything but accelerate an already fast-moving space. 
Google s Android operating system already powers most of the world s smart phones, and now Google is borrowing a page from its own playbook that could speed up development of wearable technology, including Google Glass and Google s planned smart watch.
At the South by Southwest conference Sunday, Google announced it will release an Android-based software development kit for wearable devices within two weeks, leading Al Hilwa of IDC to predict that  the era of wearables (will) see its heyday beginning in the first half of 2015. 
Trip Chowdhry of Global Equities Research was even more bullish.
 The world could be very different six to eight months from now,  Chowdhry said.
But Bob O Donnell, founder and chief analyst with TECHnalysis Research, was wary that Google s success with Android-based smart phones and tablets can be translated into wearable devices because of the challenges of converting smart phone technology into something as small as a wristwatch.
 Most watches are less than two inches diagonally that you look at several feet from your eyes,  O Donnell said.  With something that s that dramatically cut down, you cannot possibly leverage any existing applications. You have to start completely from scratch. It s going to be a completely different animal than Android. 
Google already has invited developers to use elements of Android in developing apps for Google Glass, Hilwa said.
And some niche wearable devices already on the market, such as the Pebble and Fitbit, use their own unique operating systems, O Donnell said.
Whatever hardware results from Google s software development kit also will have the additional problem of attracting ads to screens much smaller than current smart phones and tablets, which continue to struggle to generate ad revenue, O Donnell said.
 How many apps can you launch on a screen that s only two inches big?  he said.  And you can t possibly put ads on a screen that small that anyone can see.

More Android -based apps are coming soon to wearable devices, announced Sundar Pichai, Google s Head of Android. An Android-based development kit will be released in two weeks time so developers can begin making apps.
Google Glass is currently the company s only wearable device, though a smartwatch is allegedly in progress. By releasing a development kit, Google is allowing its Android platform to be used on devices from any manufacturer. Competitors like Samsung have smartwatches running the company s proprietary operating system. This means only Samsung wearables will have that operating system.
Google, however, will allow any wearable device maker to use their operating system. Android took over the mobile phone market using the same strategy and this development kit can help Google dominate the wearable market as well.
Last month, Google released its Chromecast development kit , triggering a flood of apps supporting the streaming media stick. With the release of the development kit for wearables in two weeks, we can expect to see more apps for smartwatches and other wearables soon.

Google to release wearables SDK in few weeks
Google looking to make it easier for companies to build wearable devices on Android platform

Google is getting ready to release a software development kit that will help developers build apps for wearable computers on the Android platform.
Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of product management, told an audience at the SXSW conference on Sunday that Google will release a software development kit (SDK) for wearable tech in the next few weeks.
The SDK should make it easier for third parties to build wearable devices, including computerized eyeglasses , smartwatches or even smart bracelets, to run on the Android platform.
Pichai noted that Google sees a strong connection between the ecosystems for smartphones and wearable devices.
"We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together," Pichai said, according to a report in The Verge . "They need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together... When we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly."
Google has its own hand in the wearable computer category with its upcoming Google Glass project.
Last year, Google began selling prototypes of its computerized eye glasses to about 8,000 early adopters and developers. Glass , which is expected to be released sometime this year, enables users to take photos and video and share them on Facebook and Twitter . Users also can use the eyewear to read and send emails, scan the news and see maps.
There's also speculation that Google will release its own smartwatch at its annual Google I/O developer conference being held in San Francisco in June.

Google Looks to Open Android to Flourishing Wearables Market with SDK
Posted
by Sheila Shayon
Having succeeded at making Android the most common platform for tablets and mobile devices versus cult favorite iOS, Google is now looking towards the next mobile tech frontier wearables for expansion of its platform.
Sundar Pichai, Google s SVP Android, Chrome and Apps, took center-stage at SXSW to compare the evolution of smartphones to that of wearable devices, indicating that Google would release a software development kit in the next two weeks for developers to integrate Android into apps for wearables. 
 We ll lay out a vision for developers as to how we ll see this market working,  Pichai said, according to The Verge.  We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together, they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together. [more]
With the goal being to migrate Android to a multi-screen world, buzz is getting louder around Google s rumored partnership with LG to create a smartwatch, which some expect to be revealed during Google s I/O conference in June. The OS is based on Google s Now voice assistant and search feature, both drivers of the core functions of Google Glass.
But while smartwatches may be the first wearable device rage, Google has set its sights on a robust range of offerings such as a  smart jacket  with sensors. 
 When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform,  said Pichai.  We see a world of sensors  Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors.   
Talk moderator and entrepreneurial investor John Battelle pushed for details of Google s Android licensing program, which has stringent requirements for third-party developers, but Pichai defended the platform. 
 Android is one of the most open systems I ve ever seen,  countered Pichai.  What makes Android great is it s literally designed from the ground up to be customised in a very powerful way If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it s not exclusive you can preload any other services you want. 
The openness of Android s platform will determine just how far it will be applied to this new category of devices, much like how Samsung is using the Tizen OS in its updated line of smartwatches and fitness band.

Sundar Pichai, Google s SVP of Androids, Apps and Chrome, announced during a keynote presentation at SXSW that the company will be expanding the availability of Chromecast into more markets. Pichai stated that Chromecast   which is $35 USD HDMI streaming media player   will be coming to  many more countries  in the next few weeks.
Canadians have been wanting Chomecast to arrive on Google Play since it was announced last July, but we ve been limited to Amazon or 3rd party sellers. Pichai didn t indicate which countries are on the list, a previous report indicated that the UK and Australia will be next, and hopefully Google will consider Canada.
As for sales, Pichai also declared that they ve successfully seen  millions  of units sold.

Google Inc. ( NASDAQ:GOOG ) is getting serious about the trend in wearables, according to reports from Bloomberg and The Verge. The company is releasing software tools for developers, making it easier for them to begin developing apps for wearable devices.
The company hasn t given any hints as to whether it is working on any new devices, but Google s senior vice president, Sundar Pichai, who s in charge of both the Android and Chrome teams, said he is thinking of wearables at  a platform level,  suggesting the company has the expansion of its Android operating system in mind.
Pichai said that the new Android software tools will be available in the next few weeks and will address more devices than just a wristwatch computer. Additionally, he hopes that developers will build a myriad of new apps for more devices than just smartwatches. Pichai notes that  when we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly,  per The Verge .
The market for wearable computers, Bloomberg notes, is expected to reach $20 billion in sales by 2016.

Google s Sundar Pichai has been all in on announcements at SXSW, revealing Google s plans to launch an Android SDK for wearables in two weeks and now revealing that Chromecast will launch in other regions this month, moving out of the United States.
The Chromecast has been a US only device for a heck of a long time. We originally heard Google would be launching it oversees before the end of 2013 and then the date was pushed back to March 1, but both have turned out to be false.
We are not sure what is taking Google so long considering the biggest feature on the Chromecast is the ability to stream from Chrome s open tabs, making almost every service compatible unless they strictly side against Chromecast.
Sponsored Links
Support for Chromecast may be minimal at the present time, only Netflix, Google services, Hulu, and a few others offer dedicated support. However, if the service is not supported, as long as it works on the web, it will work on Chromecast.
Chromecast is also being worked on to offer the experience on Android and other mobile platforms, meaning almost every type of service will be available to use on Chromecast. This could make it a tool to beat Apple and Roku TV, who both do not offer this deep level of integration.
Chromecast is a small USB, for those unaware, that plugs into the back of the TV and acts as a connector to the TV screen from any computer. Google won over many fans with the $35 price tag and the integration with Chrome, something we haven t seen on streaming services so far.
We are not sure how well the Chromecast has sold in the United States, but considering the device was sold out for the first few months, it would be odd to think Google has had low sales. The streaming stick may not be as popular as the Roku or Apple TV box, but it is getting close.
UK and Australia look to be the first countries to grab Chromecast and sell it in stores. We have already seen plenty of small stores on Amazon crop up offering Chromecast s for  50,and they ship the product over from the United States for a higher price.
We will be glad to see Google officially get the product into the UK and Australia, lowering the prices and possibly opening even more markets in the near future. We hope Google looks for local integration with popular networks, and in the UK s case we could see Virgin Media or Sky hop in on a deal.

Google s head of Android and Chrome, Sundar Pichai, who attended SXSW Interactive tech fair, made an official announcement: Google will release the SDK for Android-powered smart wearables.
The aforementioned Google representative said that, in about two weeks, the Mountain View-based phone maker will release the SDK for those who want to develop smartwatches, smart bands, or any other Android-powered accessories. Even though Pichai didn t mention what smart wearables will be released by Google in the near future, he said that some time, even the coat we wear will be full of sensors and run Android.
Sundar Pichai said though that Google s own smart wearables must first be tested, then presented to third-party manufactures, before they will be effectively launched on the market.
For what it s worth, the rumor mill speculates that Google will introduce its own Nexus smartphone (which will reportedly be manufactured by LG) in the fall, when the Mountain View company is also expected to announce it s next-gen Nexus smartphone, the unofficially dubbed Nexus 6.

Google Glass , Software Development Kit , smart technology
Google's new software development kit is expected to give designers more variety to make smart technology devices and exercise montioring equipment among others when it is released in two weeks according to BBC News.
"We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together," Sundar Pichai, senior vice president at Android told BBC News.
The new gadgets are also expected to run on the Android Operating system BBC News reported.

"Google is striving to avoid history repeating itself. The early wearables landscape is reminiscent of the tablet market when manufacturers sought to respond to Apple's iPad by using Android for larger screen devices before Google had fully optimised the platform," Delaney told BBC News.
The new feature detects how people move 19 different muscles in order to figure where users become frustrated or confused Tech Crunch reported.
Google Glass music capabilities allows users to look for songs, review playlists, and hear music files in good quality sound with the device on their head.
Google Glass already has many capabilities from game playing to listening to music.
Google launched its own version of headphones specifically made for the connected eyewear at $85 in December reported at the time.
Users can play tennis, a balance game which tests their ability to keep books on their head, clay shooter similar to the infamous duck hunt game, Match which evaluates how well one pairs patches with similar patterns, and Shape Splitter where shapes are broken up information on the blog said.
Google users can also send friend requests to three of their close acquaintances, and listen to music.
"Google is taking wearables seriously and it wants everyone else to," John Delaney, vice-president of mobility research at analyst firm IDC told BBC News.
There is a future with the connected eyewear based on where the market is going.
"The industry thinks wearables is the next big thing as sales of smartphones start to plateau in developed markets and this is the latest attempt to build momentum behind it. From Google's perspective, it's essential it introduces some consistency into a fast-fragmenting wearables space," Delaney told BBC News.

Google Will Release Android SDK for Wearables
LATER
By Barry Levine.                  Updated March 10, 2014 10:22AM

SDK
Having developed the most popular platform for mobile devices, Google is now targeting wearables. On Sunday, a company executive announced that an Android software development kit (SDK) for wearables will be released soon.
The executive, Sundar Pichai, made the announcement at a South by Southwest (SXSW) media conference in Austin, Texas. He said the SDK will be released before the wearables market heats up, in order to get feedback. APIs for sensors in wearables are in development, Pichai said.
The Android-for-wearables platform is expected to utilize the same model as the standard Android -- free and customizable for manufacturers. The expected release date is within two weeks.
'Smart Jacket'
Google will be releasing its own LG-manufactured smart watch, with most recent projections pointing to June at the Google I/O conference. A variety of smart watches on the market already use some form of the open-source operating system, but there's lots of headroom -- the market is projected by Juniper Research to be as large as $19 billion by 2018.
In addition to watches, the category of wearables could also include glasses, such as Google Glass, intelligent hearing aids that function as a Bluetooth microphone/earpiece, clothing with sensors and connectivity, sensor-embedded shoes, intelligent jewelry, and other clothing and accessories.
At SXSW, Pichai mentioned an Android-based, sensor-packed "smart jacket" as an example product. Another distinct possibility is that some kinds of wearables -- such as intelligent in-the-ear devices, glasses or even jewelry -- could begin to emerge with phone capabilities.
Ross Rubin, principal analyst for industry research firm Reticle Research, noted that "we've seen Android jammed into all kinds of products without Google doing much to accommodate them," including alarm clocks, all-in-ones and, of course, watches.
'Endorsement of the Category'
Now, he noted, the company is "offering explicit support in a SDK," and that is "an endorsement of the category."
Rubin added that Android is clearly the potential leader as the wearables platform, given its base in mobiles and because there "doesn't seem to be any imminent strong competition." Apple is expected to release its own iWatch at some point, but, if its experience in mobile devices and computers is any indication, iWearables will occupy a strong but minority segment of the category. Typically, Apple aims for a position as a provider of premium products, not necessarily the volume leader.
Samsung, Rubin noted, did switch to its Tizen platform in the latest release of its smart watch, but so far that OS is barely registering a position. Based on the open-source Linux OS, as Android is, Tizen was developed in 2012, and is backed by Intel as well as Samsung. There have been reports that Samsung, which makes more Android devices than any manufacturer, will be emphasizing Tizen in its future releases, such as smartphones.
Google has also been taking steps to increase its footprint in other kinds of intelligent devices. In January, for instance, it purchased intelligent thermostat maker Nest, and the company has indicated that it intends to increase its involvement in the smart car trend.

Sundar Pichai has been on a roll of announcing and revealing information on Android the past few weeks, something he has not been known for in the past few years. The Android and Chrome chief recently spoke up about Chromecast coming to other regions and has revealed that a wearable SDK for Android will be released in two weeks.
The timing of this news is rather reactive, considering Samsung just switched its Gear lineup from Android to Tizen OS, its own platform built with Intel. The move was seen as a cut from Samsung, possibly knocking one big manufacturer off the table when Android for wearables becomes big.
The wearable SDK for Android will be available for manufacturers who want to build watches and bands, we suspect. Google is not preparing to launch its own SDK for Glass at the moment, and that type of wearable may be another factor the company has to look at whenever Google Glass get an official release date.

We have also heard multiple reports of Google launching its own smartwatch with the help of LG, possibly at the Google I/O event. The Android smartwatch SDK will help Google show a standard and guidelines for manufacturers to follow in terms of design and functionality, something it has done with the Nexus smartphones and tablets.
The new Android smartwatch SDK includes a lot of Google Now functionality. Considering devices will be a lot smaller, the move to voice recognition is even more apparent on smart watches than it was on smartphones, allowing users to use applications without using the touch-screen.
Apple will apparently be heavily integrating Siri into iOS for its smartwatch platform and will push developers on iOS8 to update their apps for the iWatch. It is harder for Google to push this on developers considering the vast amount of different screen sizes and adoption of skins.
Sundar Pichai did not say any current Android manufacturers were building a smartwatch with the new SDK, although we have heard rumors of the HTC smartwatch integrating heavily with Google Now, possibly pointing to some companies getting early access to the SDK.

Google may be commonly associated with Google Glass, one of the most striking, and perhaps strangest, wearable devices out there. But where development of new wearable technology is concerned, the fun is just beginning, a top Google executive said Sunday.
Wearable gadgets aren t just smart versions of glasses or watches, but also anything that embeds sensors that can collect data and deliver it to devices that can then better serve their users, said Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Chrome, Android and apps at Google. And where that broader wearables market is concerned,  we are just scratching the surface,  he said.
Pichai discussed wearables and all things Android in an on-stage interview with author and Federated Media founder John Battelle at SXSW Interactive in Austin, Texas, on Sunday.
Google s Wearable Strategy: Everything And Then Some
It is often easy to forget that Google isn t necessarily a hardware company. It partners with manufacturers to make smartphones and tablets under the Nexus series and also has a manufacturer build Google Glass for it. Chromebooks with Chrome OS are made by partners. When the Motorola sale to Lenovo becomes official, Google will be officially out of any part of the hardware manufacturing game.
See also: Google To Release Android Software Developer Kit For Wearables
Which means that if and when Google comes out with a smartwatch, it will be in conjunction with some type of manufacturing partner. The rumors now are pointing to a Google smartwatch in conjunction with LG to be announced at its Google I/O at the end of June. In the meantime, Google will make a play to dominate the wearable world in the same way it does the mobile world with a new software developer kit for Android to be released this month. 
 In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android [wearables]. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,  Pichai said.  When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors. Sensors can be small and powerful and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors. 
Google doesn t think of wearable gadgets as just smartwatches, fitness bands, or Google Glass, Pichai said. Any type of wearable technology, be it sensors embedded in your jacket or your shoe, is the target Google is shooting for. It is the essence of the connected self that Google wants, and it needs developers to build the applications necessary to achieve that reality.
Pichai did not say how long Google has been working on the  wearable SDK , but Apigee developers Prabhat Jha and Ed Anuff figured that Google could put together a skeleton SDK (like the initial one Google released for Chromecast recently) in two weeks or a fully featured one in about six months. The question of how long Google has been working on the wearable SDK is pertinent after Samsung ditched Android for Linux-based Tizen in its new Gear 2 and Gear Fit smartwatches.
Is Google just reacting to Samsung, or has it long planned to release an SDK intended to dominate the wearable space? We will learn when the wearables SDK drops in a couple of weeks and software developers give us their impressions on its depth and capabilities.
The View From Android Central
Pichai also discussed Android at length, although his spiel on the subject hasn t evolved much. To wit: Android is open-source and freely available to anyone and has great benefit to manufacturers and developers because of its massive scale.
 Android is one of the most open systems I ve ever seen. What makes Android great is it s literally designed from the ground up to be customized in a very powerful way,  Pichai said. 
As with any mega company with a platform that affects millions upon millions of people, Google gets its fair share of speculation, gossip and general interest into what actually happens with Android. What does Google think of Amazon and Nokia s use of Android? Is Android really free? What kind of stipulations does Google give its business partners? What is really the relationship between Samsung and Google like?
See also: Sure, Microsoft Could  Fork  Android But It Would Be A Huge Waste Of Time
Amid all that speculation, Pichai sat down to   reaffirm the official talking points Google has laid out for Android.
 Nothing that we do is ever exclusive,  Pichai said about Android licensing agreements and placing Google services on devices from hardware manufacturers like Samsung or HTC.  We do have business relationships, we do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory you can use Android without Google. If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it s not exclusive you can preload any other services you want. 
Pichai and Google will insist forever that nothing nefarious is going on with Android. They respect users privacy, they are not racketeering manufacturers into Google Mobile services and so forth. The Android Open Source Project is open to all that wish to use it. Google Mobile Services is a contractual agreement where Google s apps get pre-loaded onto manufacturers  smartphones.
This is the essential white and black of Android, and neither Pichai nor Google will go into what individual business contracts look like with each one of its partners. When it comes to Android, Google sets performance and design standards and benchmarks and will be involved in the quality assurance testing of mobile devices. How manufacturers customize devices and what they pre-load onto it is of less concern to Google than making sure that the Google apps and cloud integration are present.

I've written before that the current state of smartwatches is reminiscent of the earliest Android tablets, before Google released a proper version of Android for larger screens. While some companies are trying to make Android-based smartwatches already, their efforts seem premature without Google's guidance.
That support is reportedly coming soon. According to the Wall Street Journal , Google plans to a wearable software development kit based on Android in two weeks:
Google plans to release its own smartwatch, which will be manufactured by LG Electronics. But as with the Nexus line of smartphones that Google makes, the company wants to help lay out a  vision  for other developers to power their own wearable devices.
The LG-made smartwatch is just a rumor at this point, but CNet has claimed that it will debut in June with Google Now as a centerpiece.

Sundar Pichai, head of Android and Chrome for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), said Friday at SXSW that the company will release an SDK, or software development kit, for wearable devices by March 23. Earlier reports  had said that Google would announce a new version of its operating system for wearable devices, followed by the introduction of a Nexus smartwatch made by LG Electronics.
An SDK is used by app developers to create programs. Pichai said that the SDK would allow developers to write Android software for use in smartwatches and other wearables, contrary to earlier reports that said the company would release an entirely new OS for the smaller devices.
"In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android   that will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,  Pichai said on Sunday in Austin, Texas.

According to Pichai, the goal is to take Android beyond smartphones and tablets to a connected world consisting of multiple screens. Google is also expected to unveil a Nexus-branded smartwatch during its Google I/O conference in June.
The wearable SDK will likely focus on Google Now, the company s digital personal assistant capable of making phone calls and giving updates and messages through voice. Google Now is used by the company s computing headset, Glass, as well as Motorola s Moto X smartphone.
Pichai said that Google wants to create APIs for the many sensors that the company sees popping up on everything from wearable devices like a Nexus smartwatch, to car dashboards. He said that current car tech, which often only works with Apple devices, likely causes manufacturers to lose half of their users.
Wearable technology, along with in-car infotainment systems, is expected to be the next major battleground in the tech industry, as Google goes up against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in devices based on the companies  mobile computing products.

Google Pledges to Help Developers With Wearable Devices
Google will release an Android-based software development kit for wearable devices, exec Sundar Pichai said today.

Google will release an Android-based software development kit for wearable devices, exec Sundar Pichai said today.
The SDK will be available in two weeks, Pichai said during a talk at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Afterward, a Google spokeswoman said Google is not planning a larger event around the release, but it is indeed happening.
Pichai did not address whether Google will be building its own smartwatch, as many expect. He did, however, note that wearables is a broader category than just the wrist.
The wearable SDK will address how various sensors worn on the body could work in tandem, according to Pichai.
 When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,  Pichai said.  It s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket   with sensors   I don t know. 
Meanwhile, Google hasn t released full programmer tools for its existing wearable device Google Glass, though some are available via preview to developers .
As for bringing Android into another venue that s getting smarter   cars   Pichai said he hoped that instead of cars being hardwired with a particular operating system, the technology would work similarly to Google s Chromecast for TVs.
If a $35 Chromecast dongle is plugged in, the Cast protocol allows people to bounce what they are watching on their phones onto their big screens. A smarter car interface could offer a similar experience between a driver or passenger s phone and a dashboard display.
That way, perhaps, people could avoid the silliness of having to match their car s operating system to their phone s.
Chromecast itself has been a surprisingly successful product for Google, with widespread popular appeal from the first day it was unveiled.
Pichai said that millions of Chromecasts have been sold in the U.S.   the only place where they are available. The product is about to launch internationally with localized content for various markets, as has been previously announced .

Google To Join Internet of Things with Android Platform

Google is diving into the Internet of things with plans for developer kits for wearables, CNET reported.
Sundar Pichai, who heads Google's Android and Chrome, announced on Sunday that the Android software developer kits would be available in two weeks, according to CNET.
The tech giant is looking to develop wearable devices "at a platform level," said Pichai, as reported by The Verge .
Google could present its Android system as a wearables platform, which would further the brand without involving Google in actual product development.
"We'll lay out a vision for developers as to how we'll see this market working," Pichai said, according to The Verge.
Google hopes to become the standard for wearables, which are "becoming nexuses of an array of sensors," according to The Verge. The company is looking to develop standardization across wearable devices so developers will decide to use Android instead of a custom OS.
"We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together," Pichai said, "they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together."
The Google official also hinted at the implementation of Nest, the Internet of things startup that Google purchased earlier this year for $3.2 billion .
While the maker of smart thermostats and smoke detectors should stay as its own distinct brand, it brought a strong line of products and a killer design team to Google,  Reuters  reported at the time.
Google is looking to develop a platform that will let multiple wearables work in sync, Pichai said.
"We are thinking hard about the layer which will connect all these devices together," Pichai said, according to CNET. "That's something we will work hard" for.

Our generation, also known as the Millennials, have grown so accustomed to new, interesting and advanced forms of technology.  I mean just look at us   I don t know anyone between the ages of 13   30 that doesn t own a cell phone.  So with new technologies comes new forms of spreading knowledge and education.  What s weird is that children are even caught up with the new gadgets and gizmos.  For Christmas this year, my little nephew asked for a tablet, an underwater drone, and a video game.  He s 10.  I found it so crazy that a 10 year old wanted a tablet and drone.  He s so in with the new technology.  I still thought kids at that age wanted toys and sports equipment   man was I wrong.  He ended up getting the video game and the best quality rov ever for their entire family to play with.  Isn t it cool that nowadays technology is used for professional and entertainment use?  I remember back in the day that super advanced technology was primarily used to further development and knowledge.  Now, it s used for basically anything!  There are so many start ups and businesses that strictly design tech for entertainment, which I guess, is how we got to this point.
So back to our discussion   there are so many pieces of tech out that that truly define our generation.  The iPhone, Macbook, bluetooth speakers, Fitbit, portable headphones   these are all items that we use day to day.  These pieces of technology are built essentially to fit into our changing lifestyle, and lucky for the makers, we have grown accustomed to using them daily.  We not only have adapted as a generation to rely and depend on these products but have also built higher expectations to our standard of living.  Just look at how far we ve come at creating a self-driving car.  Why did we do that?  Because people are constantly looking to the future and trying to change the world for the better.  In order to do that, they ve got to compete to create genuinely unique and original technology.  Everyone wants a piece, but the competition is extremely high.  Our generation is so focused on creating change and transforming our world into a more efficient, comfortable way of living.  This isn t a bad thing at all.  In fact, it s fascinating at how fast our technology is growing.  This is the reason that technology defines our generation.
Now, onto the cool and interesting gadgets.  Deep Trekker, a company that makes cool, underwater ROVs, is creating unique drones that you play with underwater.  These machines can basically do anything you want in any sort of body of water while you control it remotely.  Another company, Swatch, has come out with a watch that you swim with underwater.  It has a 200m dive rating so you can swim on all you want.  If you re looking for something even more techie, the new Apple watch lets you control you phone from your wrist.  You can check messages, emails, the news   similar to having your iPhone attached to your arm.  For entertainment, you can get television systems similar to Roku and Amazon Fire TV which lets you watch Netflix, control your TV wirelessly, and offers other streaming services automatically programmed on specific channels.  These make life so much easier and you have an abundance of options to choose from for when you feel like starting a new show.  Those are a couple of the new gadgets that I ve found to be extremely useful and entertaining.  Stay tuned for more!

With wearable devices becoming popular   and every major manufacturer rumoured to be preparing their own   it was only a matter of time before Google released an SDK specifically to support Android on these new form factors.
Sundar Pichai, Senior Vice President at Google, told the South by Southwest conference on Sunday that the company plans to release a SDK for makers of Android wearable devices within the next fortnight.
Google is fast becoming a household name in wearables with  Glass    the company s augmented-reality spectacles. This is undoubtedly in no small part due to its widespread media coverage...
The device, which isn t even available yet to the wider-public, is already gathering decidedly mixed opinions   especially in regards to privacy and  style  of the device.
For Google, a  Smart Watch  is a much safer bet than eyewear. These convenient devices were made popular by the Kickstarter-success, Pebble, who at the start of this year unleashed a new version with a more approachable  Steel  style.
Rumours pit Google as working with the manufacturer of most of the Mountain View-based company s  Nexus  line of smartphones and tablets, LG, to create a Google-branded smartwatch. It seems a likely scenario; if not simply as backup or to act as a  gateway drug  to the world of wearable devices to the wider-consumer.
Chromecast, which Pichai also made a strong emphasis on having sales  in the millions  and coming to more countries soon; alongside Glass; shows Google s interest in moving beyond web services and into own-brand physical hardware  A move likened to  software-maker  Microsoft with their Surface hybrid device line-up.
Both Microsoft and Apple, as Google s competitors, are both said to be preparing their own plays into the smartwatch market for their respective platforms; Windows 8 and iOS.
It makes sense for Google to want to get the jump ahead of these two and set the standard for any future Android smartwatches to come. It would also help to boost Google s main source of profit; their services; and provide consumers with the benefits of the company s ecosystem.
For example; It s easy, and exciting, to imagine Google wanting to put  Google Now  on your wrist available at-a-glance 
However, Pichai did say: "When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly. It s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket with sensors   I don t know. 
Recently Google acquired Internet of Things-darling, Nest. It s not a long-shot for a web company as big as Google to want to be the platform for this new-generation of connected devices.
With Android devices of all shape and forms out there, and 81% market share, it s a unique opportunity 
Do you think we ll see a Google smartwatch this year?

Google to Soon Release Developer Kit for Wearable Devices & Launch a Google Watch this June
It was reported on yesterday that Google executive Sundar Pichai told the South by Southwest conference Sunday that the company plans to release in two weeks a software development kit based on Android for makers of wearable devices, such as smartwatches. Google plans to release its own smartwatch, which will be manufactured by LG Electronics.
 
Smartwatches are among the first wearable computing devices, but Pichai said that Google hopes its software platform will help developers create many types of wearable devices. He threw out the possibility that one day, Google's software would be used in a "smart jacket" with sensors, reports the Wall Street Journal .
 
Last week Patently Apple discovered a Motorola patent application that was published by the U.S. Patent office. The patent which was found listed under Google patents, covers a wearable device that is clearly illustrated as a watch. The patent filing notes that "embodiments of the invention can provide a telephone keypad, for example, that is disposed along the strap of a wearable device, and that uses no electronics whatsoever. Since the strap is constantly flexing, the lack of electronic parts afforded by embodiments of the present invention is highly beneficial and results in enhanced reliability, usability, improved style, and more aesthetically pleasing form factors."
 
The design as noted below uses a strap based on an "air chamber" concept that could conform to the user's wrist. Moreover, the patent filing notes that "When the pliant material of the strap is stretched, such as may occur when the strap is stretched tightly about a user's wrist, this can be used to launch applications to monitor health conditions or to launch other applications. In one or more embodiments, these applications require the electronic device to have good contact with a user's skin."
 
In another area of the patent filing, it's noted that touching certain parts of the strap will be able to launch specific applications.
 
On the other hand, Google has been known to slap their branding on other OEM designs like their Nexus line. In this case we know that Google will be using LG to manufacture the watch and an LG patent for such came to light in early January.
 
CNET reporting from the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona last month reported that "the actual smartwatch itself will make its debut at its Google I/O conference in June."
 
Apple's Current Position on Wearables
 
Recently Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal that "Maintaining secrecy is important because talking about the future gives competitors a road map of Apple's plans and the company is 'getting ripped off left, right and sideways ."
 
A case in point would be the whole smartwatch rage. The current explosion of interest in "smartwatches" was truly ignited by the revelation that Apple had a patent pending invention on record a little over a year ago. Thereafter rumors of every kind popped up all over the net for those jumping on board. If Apple is just thinking of something cool in a patent filing, the "fast followers," that we know as copycats, go into high gear   even if they don't understand where Apple is going with the concept. These companies know full well that they could simply play a word-game with the press that plays off of Apple's patent pending innovations and score easy PR points "sounding innovative." 
 
So where does Apple stand on the coming wearables revolution? During Walt Mossberg's interview with Tim Cook at the D11 conference last year, he touched on the Nike FuelBand which he was wearing and said it was a great device focused on one thing.
 
"I would say that the ones that are doing more than one thing   there's nothing great out there that I've seen. There's nothing there to convince a kid that has never worn glasses or a band or a watch or whatever, to wear one. At least I haven't seen it. So I think that there are lots of things to solve in this space, but   it's an area where it's ripe for exploration; it's ripe for all of us to get exciting about. I think there'll be tons of companies playing in this." Cook added that "I see it as something that's another very key branch of the tree."
 
Further on, Cook noted what he felt was important in this space: "  you first have to convince people that it's so incredible that they want to wear it. Because where you two guys are wearing watches [Mossberg and Kara Swisher], if we had a room of full of 10 to 20 year olds and we said everybody stand up that has a watch on, I'm not sure anybody would stand up. I don't see it. If you look at what kids are wearing  . Their watch is this [pointing to an iPhone]."
 
Whatever Apple is working on, they're setting the bar very high and it's not going to be a watch like Samsung's Gear or the one Google is to launch in June. Apple knows that they're not the first in this space. Yet like the MP3 player space, when Apple walked in with the iPod, Apple's iTunes Store and a new approach to buying music, they created an entirely new user "experience." Something that the late Steve Jobs was adamant about delivering .
 
That's not what we're likely to see coming from the Android camp anytime soon. Then again, maybe Google will surprise us this time around. In the coming weeks and months we'll see if Google is able to think beyond the obviousness of what a digital watch should be.
 
Though if there's anything we can count on, it'll be Google trying to drown out anything Apple has to say at their developer conference in June. So expect the circus to really get crazy this June as both camps try to impress tech crazed fans around the world that they're the ones that really have their finger on the pulse of innovation that you care about.

Google wants Android to be your wearable OS of choice

Well, maybe not 'choice'...

Just because Google plans to make its own smartwatch doesn't mean developers have to avoid Android when making their own. In fact, it'll be a relative breeze to use the platform in just a few short weeks.
Google is planning to release a software development kit (SDK) later this month that will make it easier for manufacturers to power their future smartwatches with Android .
During a South by Southwest conference speech March 9, Google Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai announced the search giant's intentions to dominate the wearables market much in the same way it has smartphones.
To accomplish this task, Google plans to borrow from its own Android playbook by making a free SDK available to manufacturers and developers, part of the company's "vision" for a wearables market where its mobile OS is on everyone's wrist.
Feedback welcome
Google is reportedly working on its own smartwatch to be manufactured by LG that could debut in June, but Pichai calls the early release of an Android wearable SDK an opportunity to get "plenty of feedback" in advance of the annual Google I/O conference.
But smartwatches may be only the beginning as Pichai teased the possibility of other wearables such as a "smart jacket," which could incorporate sensors for a variety of unspecified uses.
Pichai also told SXSW attendees that Google's Chromecast will soon branch out to countries other than the US after racking up sales "in the millions" there.
The Android, Chrome and apps executive also answered a query about Google's recent Nest acquisition , saying it could deliver a future "mesh layer" of software designed to help devices interact with each other.

Google is branching out in the wearable technology market, with the release of a software development kit.
It would allow developers to create wearable devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers using the Android operating system.
Google's senior vice-president of Android, Chrome and apps said: "We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together."
The kit would be available in two weeks' time, Sundar Pichai added.

Image caption Samsung's Gear 2 uses Tizen instead of Android, which its predecessor used
Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch did run a version of Android - but after concerns over its interface and battery life, it switched to the Tizen software platform for its latest watch, the Gear 2.
Google Glass is the company's main foray into wearables so far. The device includes eyeglass frames equipped with a camera and small display controlled by voice command. The product is not yet on general sale but is being tested by selected people.
"Google is taking wearables seriously and it wants everyone else to," said John Delaney, vice-president of mobility research at analyst firm IDC.
"The industry thinks wearables is the next big thing as sales of smartphones start to plateau in developed markets and this is the latest attempt to build momentum behind it," he said.
"Google would be a competitor in the market but also an enabler if it helps Android developers."
Apple is reportedly working on a smartwatch that could use the operating system used on its iPhones and iPads.
Android is already the most used operating system on smartphones and more than 1.1 billion devices running Android are expected to ship this year, according to the research firm Gartner.
Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said it was a logical move for Google.
"From Google's perspective, it's essential it introduces some consistency into a fast-fragmenting wearables space," he said
"Without a consistent software development kit there was a danger that the wearables space would quickly result in a fragmented array of implementations that would make it harder for Google to control and monetise.
"Google is striving to avoid history repeating itself. The early wearables landscape is reminiscent of the tablet market when manufacturers sought to respond to Apple's iPad by using Android for larger screen devices before Google had fully optimised the platform," he added

(Photo : REUTERS/Robert Galbraith) Samsung has revealed a computerized wristwatch that will be capable of doing as much as a smartphone can.
More and more hardware manufacturers are interested in crafting new wearable devices to create a new niche besides tablets and smartphones.
Google has announced that it will release a software development kit later this month that will let third-party developers create Android-based wearable tech devices, according to Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome & Apps at Google.
"In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android," Pichai said during an interview with John Battelle at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas. "That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working."
Pichai compares the evolution of wearable devices to the smartphone revolution, saying that the Google's goal is to make Android more accessible to a wide variety of screens.
Basically the SDK will become a common tool to let developers create a number of sensors that are available in different types of wearable devices, not just smartwatch or glasses.
"We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together," said Pichai, according to Forbes .
With wearable devices, developers will be able to build apps that can be used for health, fitness, sports and more.
According to CNET News , Google is collaborating with electronics manufacturer LG, which is based in South Korea, to produce a smartwatch that will debut at its Google I/O in June.
The SDK is thought to be based on the Google Now voice assistant and search feature, which can also be found in the main functions of the Google Glasses. While smartwatch sales have not been that great, the market is set to reach $19 billion by 2018, according to Juniper Research via CNET.
In a statement Juniper Research's Nitin Bhas said that the increase is all because of a "heightened consumer awareness of wearable technology."

Google SVP says Chromecast sales reached millions
By
Tweet on Twitter
It seems that Google  s Sundar Pichai isn t done making big revelations at SxSW today. Just after pre-announcing a wearable device SDK coming in two weeks, the Google exec has now disclosed that the company was able to sell millions of its immensely popular Chromecast dongle.
Anyone doubting how big Chromecast is should probably take a look at TIME Magazine s top ten gadgets of 2013 . Not only did the device sell out just a day after it became available for purchase, it has started a new trend among streaming devices as well. After all, who can beat a small device the size of a thumbdrive that can stream videos, music, photos, and even browser tabs to an HDMI-enabled TV?
Things are about to get even better with the Chromecast. Google has finally unleashed the Chromecast SDK to developers and has also rolled out the official Chromecast support in Google Play Services. This opens the floodgates to even more content sources and uses for the little dongle, like casting photos from Dayframe , or mirroring your Android device s screeen. That s not counting the other content providers who are just now also hopping on board.
Although not entirely a revelation, Pichai once again reminded the audience that Google wants to bring Chromecast to more markets around the world. So even if Pichai s rather vague  millions  estimate wasn t accurate, Chromecast could very well reach those numbers when it hits international markets.

Android SDK for wearables coming in two weeks  time
By
Tweet on Twitter
Google has sold  millions  of Chromecasts, according to Android and Chrome chief Sundar Pichai. In addition to the sensational news of Chromecast sales, Pichai also noted at SXSW there would be an Android SDK for wearables coming soon. It fits a previously leaked timeframe, but little else was said for Google s version of wearable software.
Though Pichai didn t note exactly what the SDK would entail, he did say it wasn t solely for smartwatches. According to him, Google s idea is that the SDK will be built by them, saying it would be Gogole s  vision for developers of how we see this market working . but Developers and OEMs will have the option to pick and choose what to use. That makes it a more cross-platform option for wearables in general, and frees interested OEMs up to hardware development.
Pichai did give a solid timeline for a wearable SDK from Google, which is rare. Though he didn t give specifics as to what the SDK would include, he did say it would arrive n two weeks  time. While some expected a whole new operating system, it sounds as though there will be a simple SDK, at least for now. Many believe the smartwatch will be based on Google Now, so perhaps Developers will now have access to a Google Now SDK   something many have pined for since the launch of the Search skin.
Chromecast sales are interesting, but the little plug-in heading to more countries is much more important. The Android SDK for wearables is a potentially big deal for tiny devices, and could do for smartwatches and other wearables what Android did for smartphones. We ll be looking forward to an announcement from Google later this month.

Google Commits To Developer Support For Broad Range Of Wearable Devices With Upcoming SDK
Google is looking to gain a huge chunk of the wearables market with an SDK --no not, the Google Glass GDK , which is still in the offing as a Developer Preview, but a more general SDK that could be used for just about anything that you can wear as a garment or accessory and has some sort of  smart  capabilities.
The news was revealed by Google Senior VP Sundar Pichai at an event at SXSW. He told a crowd that the SDK will be available in about two weeks and will be based on Android , according to Re/code.  When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,  he said.  It s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket   with sensors. I don t know. 
Google Senior VP Sundar Pichai
Most imagine that it could be used for a Google-made smartwatch, although Pichai did not address whether or not that particular device is going to happen.
It s perhaps an obvious move for Google to release an SDK like this that could be used for any number and variety of applications, but it s also a wise one. The wearables market is starting to take off in a big way, and this will help Google in its effort to become one of the biggest players.

Android has already graced numerous wearable products, including the first-generation Samsung Galaxy Gear and two generations of the Sony Smartwatch. But Google s head of Android, Sundar Pichai, told a SXSWi crowd that the company will release a wearable SDK in the next two weeks, making it far easier for third-party developers to create apps using the platform.
Pichai s goal from this expedition is to make Android work flawlessly with a number of sensors, hardware beyond just the regular smartphone retinue like accelerometer and proximity sensor. While Android has proven to be extremely extensible across a number of screen sizes and product categories, Google s yet to provide developers a set of guidelines, like they did for smartphones and tablets, to create better wearable opportunities.
What the SDK will look like remains to be seen, but it will no doubt make the Android experience, across all devices, better for everyone. Google is thought to be working with LG on a smartwatch, which will perhaps be announced during Google I/O in June. Whether it comes to fruition this year or next, it s clear Google is marching to the same wearable beat as the rest of the industry.

Google s Android boss (the head of the OS, that is   he s not literally an android) has announced that Google is going to unleash a wearables SDK very shortly.
The idea is to do exactly what Google has done with Android and smartphones, but in the wearables market, which is currently taking off and causing plenty of buzz (there was a whole heap of wearables stuff at both CES and MWC recently, particularly health and fitness gizmos ).
Sundar Pichai spoke about the Software Development Kit at SXSW. According to the Guardian , he said:  In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables. 
 When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors. 
(We might add that sensors can be small and powerful   and gather a lot of information for Google, as well).
Clearly, Google sees wearables as playing a big part in the future   a future in which it has its data-mining paws everywhere   but Pichai wouldn t be drawn on rumours that the big G was developing its own smartwatch . He didn t mention anything about hardware, and said that  from my standpoint and the team s standpoint, we want to focus on the platform and the APIs. 
Google does, of course, have Google Glass on the boil.
At any rate, Pichai hopes that the release of the SDK will spark product developers to go beyond smartwatches and fitness gadgets, and start to innovate and create a whole range of smart devices.
As we reported earlier today, Pichai also mentioned the Chromecast streaming dongle   which should be coming to the UK before the end of March (fingers crossed).

FAQ: What to know for the GeekWire Bash
It s been a good run so far for Google s Chromecast video streaming dongle. The $35 device, which plugs into a TV s HDMI port and allows users to stream video from a number of different sources, captured the interest of consumers, in part because it s incredibly cheap compared to its competitors, like Apple s $99 set-top box.
As it turns out, that pricing strategy has worked quite well for Google. Sundar Pichai, the company s Vice President of Android, Chrome and Apps, told an audience at SXSW yesterday that sales of the Chromecast were  in the millions now, and it s growing very actively,  according to a report by AndroidHeadlines .
Google isn t stopping anytime soon, either. Pichai says that the company plans to expand Chromecast sales to international markets. While he wasn t clear about which markets will be getting the dongle, the Chromecast s low price and support for popular services like Netflix and YouTube will make it an attractive choice for budget-conscious buyers wherever it expands next.
The competition is going to keep heating up, though. Apple is rumored to be working on a major update to the Apple TV that would include more streaming options, and Amazon is said to be developing its own set-top box that includes gaming capabilities.

The Google Nexus 5 has been on the market for less than six months, but rumors are already accumulating about its successor, likely to be called the Nexus 6.
Some of the first news about the Nexus 6 came directly from Google Senior Vice President  Sundar Pichai , who discussed the coming Nexus smartphone at the World Mobile Congress in February. Pichai assured that the device would not be released in the first half of the year, which has led many to believe that the Nexus 6 may launch in the last months of 2014. Sources have recently told Android Geeks that the Nexus 6 may be announced in October, which falls in step with many previous unveilings of Nexus devices. The Nexus 5, for example, launched on Oct. 31 last year and went on sale in November. The Nexus 4 launched on Oct. 29, 2012, and the Galaxy Nexus launched on Oct. 19, 2011. Even if the Nexus 6 announcement timeline is plausible, it may be some time before the public gets more concrete information on the device.
There may also be plenty of time for Google to surprise the public with a new launch strategy. Notably, Google forwent an unveiling event for the Nexus 5 last year and simply announced the device and Android 4.4 KitKat operating system on its blog, as well as on the Google Play Store . Fans and pundits may expect Google to provide a similar launch for the Nexus 6, or something else completely unexpected.
Nexus 6 concept Photo: 91mobiles
Still, murmurs suggest that the Nexus 6 may be developed by LG and may also take after the rumored LG G3 in design; these rumors also piggyback from old rumors that surrounded the Nexus 5 and Nexus 4 in their pre-release periods. Both the Nexus 5 and Nexus 4 were developed by LG and we both based on other LG devices --- the LG G2 was the model for the Nexus 5, while the Nexus 4 took inspiration from the LG Optimus G. Consumers saw both previous Nexus devices feature similar specs to their LG counterparts; in particular; the Nexus 5 and LG G2 both featured a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor, a 1080p display and Optical Image Stabilization included in their cameras. Many expect that the Nexus 6 may include a number of specs to be introduced on the LG G3.
The still unofficial LG G3 is rumored to feature a Qualcomm Snapdragon 805 processor, a 5.3-inch or 5.4-inch 1080p True HD-IPS display, 2GB or 3GB mobile RAM, 16GB and 32GB of internal memory, a 13-megapixel to 16-megapixel camera, 3,200 or 3,300 mAh batteries, and the Android 4.4 KitKat operating system. Other rumors suggest the LG G3 may feature a 5-inch screen with Full HD or 2K resolution and a battery around 2,500 mAh. Reports predict a June release for the LG G3, after which we may be able to decipher more information about the Nexus 6.
The LG G3 and Nexus 6 may not share an operating system, however, as Nexus devices notably introduce the newest Android OS to the market. It is likely two Android updates will be released by the time the Nexus 6 launches. Users should expect an update in the summer and another update, which should be launched alongside the Nexus 6. At this point, it cannot be determined whether Google will continue the Android KitKat series; however, the Mountain View, Calif., company is well known for releasing two updates each year. 
Reports indicate that the Nexus 6 may feature an exterior design unlike any seen on previous Nexus devices, seeing as Google usually opts for a unique design on each generation of its devices. The Nexus 5 features a matte-and-ceramic type texture, while the Nexus 4 features a double-sized glass exterior.
Many are also certain that we will not learn anything about the Nexus 6 at the Google I/O conference in June. Sources have told Android Geeks that there will be no Nexus or Android announcements at Google I/O, but such new may be saved for an event later in the summer, where the Nexus 8 and Android 4.5 operating system may be unveiled. If true, Google s 2014 timeline may mimic its release schedule from last year. In 2013, we saw Google launch new Chromebooks, developer tools and the Google Play Edition Samsung Galaxy S4 at Google I/O. In July, Google launched its Nexus 7 2013 tablet alongside the Android 4.3 Jelly Bean operating system, and introduced the Nexus 5 and Android 4.4 OS in October.
As said, it may take some time for Nexus 6 rumors to solidify, but recent reports indicate that many are interested in the coming devices.

10 VoIP Companies and Technologies to Watch in 2013
Google will release a software development kit for wearable devices, including smartwatches as well as potential wearables developed in the future, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal . The company says it will make its Android-based kit available in two weeks.
Explore how data can be processed from wearable sensors in a standardized format. Look for the Android SDK to aid development of apps that connect to wearable medical sensors.
Sundar Pichai, Google s vice president overseeing Chrome, Android and Google Apps, delivered the news at the South by Southwest Conference in Austin, Texas, on March 9. The SDK is intended for developers working with wearable devices, whether or not the devices are Google-made.
Google will release Android SDK for wearables in two weeks.
"We'll lay out a vision for developers as to how we'll see this market working," Pichai said, according to a report by The Verge .
Much as it did with its Android operating system for smartphones, Google will release its SDK for free and will look for feedback from developers. 
Android comprises more than 80 percent of smartphone operating share, according to IDC s Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker . Apple makes up 12.9 percent of share, with other mobile operating systems, including BlackBerry and Windows Phone, accounting for the last 7 percent.
In 2009, Android had a 2.8 percent share of smartphone shipments. By 2010, Android would grow to capture 33 percent of share, reaching more than 52 percent share in 2011, and 75 percent share in 2012.
Pichai emphasized that the growth of the wearables ecosystem will create a need for a system to process data from wearables (and the sensors they might use) in a standardized way. He described the need for wearable device operation to bring together the  mesh  layer, composed of software and a  data  layer.
"We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together," Pichai said, according to The Verge report.
Though the company has not yet confirmed the rumors, Google is expected to release its own smartwatch in collaboration with LG later this year at the Google I/O developer conference in June. LG also manufactures Google s Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphones.
Google released its landmark wearable Google Glass device in April 2012.
But Google isn t just looking at watches and glasses. Instead, the company is thinking of wearables  much more broadly,  Pichai noted, using a sensor-laden smart jacket as an example. Google has also given details of its efforts to develop  smart  contact lenses that could help diabetes patients better monitor their daily glucose levels.
Google has also made significant investments in improving its voice-recognition capabilities, a feature that many believe will prove crucial to developing operating systems for small-screen wearable devices. Rival Apple is also thought to be readying a smartwatch for release later this year.

Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will release in two weeks a software-development kit for developers to let them more easily put Google's Android platform into wearable computing devices, according to a senior Google executive.
Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android and Chrome, said at the South by Southwest conference Sunday that the search giant will use the SDK to "lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working."
Pichai said he thinks about wearables "at the platform level" and is focused on how to have Android hook into devices. He also said, according to The Verge, that he sees similarities between how wearables are evolving and how the smartphone ecosystem developed. Smartphones are tiny computers, he said, but wearables are now becoming nexus points for a wide range of sensors. Google is now looking to standardize how sensors from wearables send information to and interface with Android, which should make it more palatable for developers to make wearables running the platform.
Google took something of a hit last month when Samsung Electronics, the largest maker of Android devices, unveiled two new smart watches running the Tizen operating system, not Android as its previous Galaxy Gear watch had. There are also rumors that Google is working with LG Electronics to develop its own smart watch, which could be unveiled at Google's I/O developer conference in June, according to CNET.
Pichai did not discuss any of the rumors at SXSW but he did say he thinks of wearables as more than watches and that "when we say we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly" than just that. According to the Wall Street Journal, he tossed out the possibility that someday, Google's software would be used in a "smart jacket" with sensors.
"We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together," Pichai said, "they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together." The "mesh" layer technology is where Google's $3.2 billion deal to acquire Nest Labs, a maker of smart thermostats, smoke alarms and other home gadgets, could come into play.
According to Re/code, as for Android in cars, Pichai said his vision is for cars not to come hardwired with any specific platform. Instead, he thinks it could work similarly to Google's Chromecast for TVs. The $35 Chromecast lets people send what they are viewing on their smartphones to larger TVs. With this setup, it would not matter if a person's phone and car operating system matched, he said. Google's Open Automotive Alliance, which was formed in January, is designed to make cars more Android-friendly.

Google is throwing its weight into the wearable-technology space, potentially opening up opportunities for developers.
At the South by Southwest conference in Austin on Sunday, Google senior vice president Sundar Pichai announced that in two weeks the tech company will release an Android-based software development kit for wearable device makers. The company also announced plans to release its own smartwatch--manufactured by LG Electronics--in June, The Wall Street Journal reported .
The software kit will offer developers outside the Google ecosystem a "playbook" of sorts to follow in making wearable devices.
In his announcement, Pichai said that Google hopes to get feedback from developers on the software kit before unveiling its smartwatch later in the year. The move could also be a way for the tech giant to identify and attract new developer talent, the Journal reported.

Google Chromecast launching in more countries within weeks
03/10/2014
by Brad Linder Leave a Comment
Google s $35 Chromecast media streamer provides one of the cheapest, simplest tools for streaming online video to your TV  if you re in the United States. But soon Google will begin offering the Chromecast around the world.
Speaking this week at SXSW, Google s Android and Chrome chief Sundar Pichai announced that Chromecast would be available in many additional countries within the next few weeks.
Meanwhile, the Chromecast has apparently been a rather successful product in the US, where Pichai says Google has sold  millions  of Chromecast devices since the gadget launched in the summer of 2013.
At launch the Chromecast was a fairly limited device, designed to let users stream content from a handful of internet video sites including YouTube, Netflix, and Google Play Movies while using and Android or iOS phone or tablet as a remote control.
In the months since the device first hit the market a growing number of apps have added support and now you can use many popular online music and video services with a Chromecast. Google also recently launched an SDK which lets app developers build Chromecast support into all sorts of third party apps.

Initially I misunderstood these  Cast  sticks, including the Roku offering.
So all it does it receive a sound and video stream from a compatible  Casting  device?
Not too impressed to be honest. If it were able to stream anything from my PC / mobile then that's a different matter, but restricting it to only certain browsers or apps just restricts the use too much for my money.
Posted by Dooms - Tue 11 Mar 2014 12:14
I've been using a chromecast for few months now and for US$35 can't really complain. Yeah you have to stream from something but these days when don't you have a smartphone or tab near you  I was already using mine for a remote anyway.
Streaming tabs from Chrome PC is good as well.
Now that they have opened up the API more and more apps are getting support.

That's a good point. My mobile is generally an extension of me and is always within arms reach. Still tempted and might just have to take a gambit and see where it leads, although i'll need to find one that can stream from PC without going through chrome browser.
On a side point, anyone know if chromebooks get native support for casting the screen / sound? i.e. can I use the chromecast to setup a 2nd monitor?
Posted by Smudger - Tue 11 Mar 2014 15:07
The way I understood it, your phone/tablet (with Chromecast app) tells the chromecast what to stream, but the Chromecast itself streams from the internet so once you're finished with the act of  casting , you can do what you want with the phone/tablet, even switch it off and the film/music will still stream.

That is true (unless you are streaming from a tab in chrome) - I quite often swap control devices mid stream when I want to pause or something and I just grab the closest device :P

The journey towards a Google-powered smartwatch appears to be just a little bit closer, as Sundar Pichai announced an SDK for developers to build apps that play nice with Android.
Using a smartwatch on Android isn t all that useful right now. You either get a notification dumpster on your wrist, or you have a separate platform with apps that may or may not play nicely with the apps on your phone. In an ideal environment, the apps on your phone would compliment or enhance the apps on your wrist, allowing for reciprocal functionality that make these accessories a lot more useful.
In order to do that you either need Google s help or you need your own tools for developers to add into their existing apps. Since no one has been able to do the latter in any successful fashion yet, it was important to wait for Google to do their thing and create the tools and extend their sandbox to wearables.
During the SXSWi conference in Austin, Texas last weekend that finally happened.
Google s Android and Chrome chief Sundar Pichai announced on stage that a wearables SDK would be coming in the next couple of weeks. The goal of this SDK will be to  lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working,  according to Pichai.
Historically, this kind of SDK points towards a reference device of some kind in order to give developers a clear target to shoot at. We ve known for some time that Google has been preparing a smartwatch of their own using the talented engineers they acquired when they purchased WIMM , and while it s possible that this watch will accompany the SDK announcement it is also likely Google will work with a third party until they are ready to deploy their own smartwatch.
It s unclear whether or not Google Glass will be included in this SDK, but there s a good chance for some crossover there. Google has the ability to put services like Google Now on your wrist, which would be an enormous differentiator between Google s hardware and the existing wearables available today.
This is the kind of thing many were expecting Google to announce at their annual developers conference, but the release of the updated Gear line from Samsung may have encouraged Google to accelerate those plans. We ll see soon enough what Google has up their sleeves for the wearables market, and whether or not their plans will be enough to cause a shift in how useful wrist and face mounted computers really are.

Google plans to release a software development kit in the next two weeks that will allow third-party developers to create Android software for use on wearable computing devices.
The announcement was made Sunday by Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android , Apps and Chrome, during a panel discussion with John Battelle at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas.
"In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android," Pichai said. "That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working."
Likening the evolution of wearable devices to the smartphone revolution, Pichai said the goal is to take Android beyond smartphones and tablets to a multi-screen world.
Google is expected to unveil plans for its smartwatch-centric operating system later this month, a person familiar with the company's plans told CNET in February. Google is said to be working with South Korean electronics maker LG to produce a smartwatch that will make its debut at its Google I/O conference in June.
The new operating system is said to be based on the Google Now voice assistant and search feature, which also drives the core functions of Google Glass . While sales of smartwatches haven't exactly been impressive, the market is estimated to be worth $19 billion by 2018 , according to Juniper Research.

Sr. Managing editor, International at LinkedIn   "Curious by profession" 
ALL YOUR WATCHES BELONG TO US   Google is setting out to replicate in smartwatches, fitness bracelets, etc. the success it had in smartphones   and expanding its dominion over our technological lives. Exec Sundar Pichai announced at SxSW that Google will be releasing its Android operating system for wearables. The software development kit should be available to developers in two weeks. The strategy of licensing its operating system while also selling its own hardware   Google will release a smartwatch this June   has worked well for mobile devices, where Android ships on 4 out every 5 phones and where Android tablets started outselling iPads in 2013. Here's hoping, along with famed designer and LinkedIn Influencer Don Norman, that the OS will help make "smart" wearables a bit less dumb .
BIG (LYING) DATA   Data coming out of China are decidedly puzzling: Chinese exports plunged 18.1 percent in February year-over-year. Or at least that's what the numbers say. Analysts are pointing to the issue of over-invoicing by Chinese businesses   capital flows disguised as exports to evade China s capital controls, as the Financial Times explains   which was already blamed for a hard-to-believe trade surplus in January. "Chinese firms have been actually faking exports less since last spring but the practice is still creating trade distortions, by making this year s declines this year look steeper than they actually are ," writes Quartz's Lily Kuo. In short, no one's quite sure what the reality of China's economy is, though it does seem to be slowing.
AND THEN THERE WERE TWO   In China still, the e-commerce war is intensifying as Tencent and JD.com strike an alliance against Alibaba. Tencent purchased 15 percent of online retailer JD.com, which is about to go public in the US, and will outsource its own e-commerce activities to it. Alibaba still corners nearly 50 percent of the market but now the competition has the muscles to challenge that. Tencent is the biggest Internet firm In China but has so far got most of its revenue from social media and mobile gaming, with a more modest involvement in online retail .
BITCON?   After first doing so in Japan, where it is headquartered, Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in the US on Sunday . That very claim of bankruptcy is being questioned by hackers who say Mt. Gox was sitting on a lot more Bitcoins than reported. CEO Mark Karpel s' blog, Tumblr and Reddit accounts were hacked to post documents showing Mt. Gox held 951K bitcoins before the online attack that wiped the exchange's accounts clean , even though Karpel s announced 850k were stolen. So if those documents prove to be true   and several Reddit users, who can verify their own account in them, say they are   it begs the question: Where did more than 100,000 bitcoins go? Others on Reddit are pointing out that the documents are consistent with Mt. Gox's story that their internal accounting did not match the reality of their holdings. Not enough info to tell at the moment .
TOP BANANA   You thought telcos were a concentrated industry? A giant of the banana trade is about to be born, through the marriage of Chiquita, #2 on the market, and Fyffes, #4. The US and Irish companies, to be reborn as ChiquitaFyffes, will together corner 29 percent of the market, passing Dole and Fresh Del Monte. These three corporations will together produce three out of every four bananas in lunch boxes around the world. And that's not even counting melons, pineapples and salads.
Have you also thrown your dumb smartwatch against the wall in frustration? Are you concerned about the concentration of our food suppliers?

Google releasing Android SDK for wearables this month
Google releasing Android SDK for wearables this month

Google s Android chief, Sundar Pichai announced that Google will be releasing a developer SDK in two weeks.
| TOI Tech | Updated: Mar 10, 2014, 07.51 PM IST
Google s Android chief, Sundar Pichai announced that Google will be releasing a developer SDK in two weeks. 
NEW DELHI: It looks like wearable devices are poised to go mainstream, with technology giant Google all set to release a developer SDK based on
Android
, especially created for wearable devices.
Speaking at the SXSW conference at Austin, Texas, Google's Android chief,
Sundar Pichai
announced that Google will be releasing a developer SDK in two weeks.
"In two weeks, we are launching the first developer SDK for Android. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working," Pichai said.
The SDK will allow device manufacturers to make wearable devices that run Android and developers to create apps for them. Pichai did not reveal if Google was also working on a wearable device of its own, but said that he thinks about wearables at a "platform level." This means that just like phones, Google wants to be omnipresent on wearable devices across device makers.
"We'll lay out a vision for developers as to how we'll see this market working," he said. He also clarified that wearables was a broad category (and not just about smartwatches).
As noted by The Verge, Pichai wants a uniform standard for wearables to communicate with sensors that are embedded in the devices. The sensors help the devices connect with the users' body and track vital statistics, as most wearables focus on health and wellness.
It was recently reported by the Wall Street Journal that Google was working on its own wrist-worn device in collaboration with LG and that Google will also partner with other device makers. A CNET report had also mentioned that Google will reveal the smartwatch OS in March and will unveil the watch in June at the Google I/O event.

The wearable technology tidal wave is clearly on the horizon, and indeed Samsung announced no less than three smartwatches at Mobile World Congress (MWC) a couple of weeks ago.
Of course, that particular trio runs Tizen, but Google is on the verge of firing out an SDK for the Android faithful.
That s the news from out of the SXSW festival, which is probably best known for its music stuff, but also encompasses Film and Interactive.
Sundar Pichai, Google s SVP of Android, Apps and Chrome, says the SDK rollout - expected in a couple of weeks - will include a  vision for developers of how we see this market working .
Of course, we re not just talking about smartwatches here. One of the other notable examples of wearable tech is Google Glass, the augmented reality thingy for your head.
Pichai says it s Google's role to provide the SDK, but up to developers what they do with it.
We re still not entirely convinced about wearable tech, with two of the major selling points seemingly being a) fitness applications, and b) the slight convenience of not having to take your phone out of your pocket.
Regardless, expect the smartwatch scene in particular to explode when the Apple iWatch touches down later this year.
In other SXSW news, Pichai says Google Chromecast is coming to "many more countries" in the coming weeks. Come oooooooon UK.
<<<<111
>>>>113
In Austin, it's South by South Westeros
But Google knows that mobile phones still present a huge growth opportunity, and Pichai lauded the full range of phones -- from sub-$100 devices to high-end smart phones -- that can lead to the next billion users. Pichai touted Google's willingness to let people use Android for free, though he noted that the company requires licensing if companies want to build Android devices with Google services on top of the OS.
When it comes to auto manufacturers implementing Android, Pichai noted that in today's world, many choose to stick to Apple's iOS. But he likened that approach to walking into a hotel and finding that an in-room stereo system only works with iOS devices. "They're probably losing at least half of their users," he said.
Battelle asked if Google has plans to put Android on technology like devices from Nest, which it recently purchased for $3.2 billion. Pichai wouldn't bite but did say that Google hopes to develop a set of common protocols that allow different devices to work together. Without being specific, he hinted that Nest could be part of that. "We are thinking hard about the layer which will connect all these devices together," Pichai said. "That's something we will work hard" for.
Chromecast
While Google doesn't say how many of its Chromecast systems it's sold, Pichai did say that the number is in the millions, all in the United States. And Google recently released an SDK for the Internet streaming device which 3,000 developers have already registered for.As well, Google is expecting to begin making Chromecast available internationally within weeks.
Project Ara
Pichai also touched briefly on Google's internal Project Ara, a skunkworks of sorts for advanced projects and research.
He said that the effort is aimed at concepts that are slightly futuristic, but which can be quickly commercialized. For example, he said, the Project Ara team is working on ways to create modular smart phones , devices that can be broken down into component parts so that rather than replacing a phone, they can have new parts added. "Think about it as APIs for hardware," Pichai said. "So people can build together in a modular way."

Google s(s goog) Android operating system already powers countless phones and tablets (as well as a few TVs), but it might soon be coming en masse to another location: Your wrist. According to The Verge, Google SVP of Android and Chrome Sundar Pichai told the crowd at SXSW on Sunday that Google has plans to release a software development kit for Android-powered wearables within the next two weeks.
 We ll lay out a vision for developers as to how we ll see this market working,  Pichai said. But aside from that, an SDK will also provide developers with the tools needed to get these devices running. This could be huge   for both Android and wearables.

As wearable devices like smartwatches continue to gain in popularity, developers just entering the field could be more likely to look to Android, since there s already such a massive user base for Android phones and tablets. And if Android-powered wearables work closely with their mobile counterparts, it could enhance the experience all around. Though Samsung s Android-powered  Galaxy Gear  smartwatch wasn t such a hit, I think that with some guidance from Google there s still promise.
Then again, given Android s history with fragmentation issues , it could also turn into a massive headache where certain Android-powered wearables are unable to work with certain smartphones running outdated software.
Google is likely taking issues like this into account, but Pichai didn t go into great detail about the wearables OS, nor did he address Google s own rumored smartwatch . We should  get a better idea of the company s plans when the SDK is released shortly.

Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is all set to release a software development kit (SDK) for wearable devices in the next two weeks, according to Sundar Pichai, SVP of Android, Chrome & Apps. The SDK would be used to create a standard method for sensors to  talk  to the Android operating system.
 We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,  said Pichai at South by Southwest (SXSW), reported The Verge .
Google focusing on platform level
Through SDK, developers could design apps for wearable devices like games and fitness trackers. The popular wearable devices are smart-watches, fitness bands and smart-jackets.
Pichai did not reveal if the company is making a new wearable device, but according to the rumors, Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is collaborating with LG electronics for a new smart watch. LG made a smart watch which is integrated with Google Now enabling a user to give commands any time and receive feedback. Google is expected to unveil the new smartwatch at the I/O developer event, in June.
Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) designed Google Glass , the first wearable gadget from the tech giant. Google Glass is fitted with an optical head-mounted display that displays information on natural language commands. Google Glass sports a 5 megapixel camera, and can record at 720 pixels.
During the interview at SXSW, Pichai was asked if the company is hoping to integrate Android on devices made by Nest, a home automation company that Google acquired for $3.2 billion. Pichai not directly answered the question, but hinted that Nest could play an important role in the  mesh layer,  enabling devices to co-ordinate with each other.
Apple a formidable rival
Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) faces a stiff competition from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the wearable segment, which is known pretty much to the market. Last year, in December, Apple operations head Jeff Williams held a meeting with FDA executives Dr. Margaret Hamburg and Dr. Jeffrey Shuren to discuss the  mobile medical applications.  The iPhone maker is said to be designing sensor technology under the supervision of Tomlinson Holman, inventor of Lucasfilm THX sound system and the first 10.2 sound systems.
Holman is doing research on predicting heart attacks by studying the sounds that blood makes while flowing through arteries. Apple is also hiring health and medical experts to launch new products. Also, the company could be gearing up to unveil a smartwatch or fitness bands that can predict health stats like heart rate, calories and step counts within the next year or two.

Google commits to Android wearable tech devices
Monday March 10, 2014
Print Article
An illustration picture shows a Google logo with two one Euro coins, taken in Munich January 15, 2013.   Reuters picSAN FRANCISCO, March 10   Sundar Pichai, head of Android, has announced that software development kits for creating operating systems for everything from smartwatches to headsets are coming this month.
Pichai made the announcement at SXSW Interactive and said that the software development kits (SDKs) will not only make it easier for companies and individuals to use Android on fitness trackers, motion sensors and other wearable tech devices, it would also simplify data collection from sensors in order to create supporting apps and functionality.
Google has identified a need to create a common platform and language for wearable devices so that they work with each other and for the time being at least, Pichai said that this is where the company will be focusing its efforts.
It has no plans to announce a consumer-ready wearable tech device of its own, for the moment anyway.
In recent months, reports have emerged that Google is developing a smartwatch in collaboration with LG, and of course the company already makes one of the world s highest-profile wearable technology devices in the form of Google Glass. However, Pichai s comment that Google is not ready to make any consumer announcements suggests that the smart headset is still some way from being ready for the mass market.

Google to release Android SDK for wearables in 2 weeks
With a rumored smartwatch in the making, Google wants to jumpstart the wearables landscape
Technology trends and news by Faith Merino

Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/358a
Google may be gearing up to unveil its very own smartwatch later this year, but when has it ever bogarted its own OS? Google executive Sundar Pichai revealed at SXSW that Google plans to release the Android SDK for wearables in two weeks.
Pichai said that Google is releasing the SDK for wearables well before the devices hit the market so that it can get  plenty of feedback  first, which obviously means Google would also be able to strengthen its own smartwatch.
But of course, smartwatches aren t the only device Google thinks Android could power. Pichai mentioned that the software could one day be used to power a  smart jacket  with sensors. For some reason.
Pichai is a high-level Google exec, overseeing Android, Chrome, and apps like Gmail. He also oversees hardware, like the Nexus smartphone and tablet, Chromebook, and Chromecast. Pichai mentioned at the conference that Chromecast sales are now  in the millions. 
Google s own smartwatch, which has not been confirmed by the company, is reportedly slated for release some time this year. A report from TechCrunch last month stated the watch would start shipping in mid- to late March, but a later report from CNET suggested the watch won t make its big debut until June.
The smartwatch will reportedly come with a full-color display and an LCD background, as well as  Google Now  alerts, which are personalized alerts that include meeting alerts, traffic updates, events, sports scores, stocks, dinner reservations, weather alerts, flight updates, and more.
Google is said to be working with LG on the smartwatch, as it did with the Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphone. The smartwatch is expected to be a paired device, requiring an Android phone.
Researchers from Canalys forecasted last month that smart bands would ship 8 million units in 2014. That number is expected to triple to 23 million next year, and by 2017, Canalys estimates over 45 million smart bands will be shipped.
Currently, Samsung holds the lead in the smartwatch market with a 54% market share, followed by Sony with a 19% market share, and Pebble with 16% of the market.
In addition to Samsung, Sony, and Pebble, Google may also be coming up against Apple, which has looooong been rumored to be developing an iWatch that may be solar-powered and would likely come with a greater health focus. Apple is reportedly working on a feature for iOS 8 called Healthbook, which would monitor the user s vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, hydration, and possibly even blood data points like glucose levels, in addition to the usual  calories burned  and  steps taken  features.

Google reveals Android wearables SDK is imminent
Your smart anorak idea could soon be reality
0 Comments
INTERNET GIANT Google's Android SVP Sundar Pichai has revealed that the company will release a software development kit (SDK) for wearables within the fortnight.
Speaking at the South By Southwest conference (SXSW) in Austin, Texas, Sundar announced the imminent arrival of "Android for Wearables".
He told conference attendees, "When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors."
Google's own wearable Google Glass is scheduled for release during 2014 and rumours of a Google Now watch persist, despite there having been no word from Google about whether the device exists. There is talk of a collaboration with LG that might be revealed at the Google I/O developers conference, but Google hasn't announced anything yet.
Pichai was keen to point out that the release of the SDK represents an opportunity to go beyond glasses and watches, describing them as "the tip of the iceberg".
Apparently the SDK will represent a framework model for the Internet of Things, the vision of smart gadgets that are able to interconnect. The Internet of Things will be the topic of a debate at The INQUIRER that starts next week.
So far Google has been playing it cool about releasing its own products, wearable or otherwise, and has even hinted at the end of the Nexus range, however its release of a wearables SDK will make it easier for third parties to produce wearables running Android.

Google Glass helped launch the burgeoning wearable tech market, but now the search giant is branching out beyond its futuristic specs.
Google senior vice president Sundar Pichai told SXSW attendees this weekend that, before the end of the month, Google will launch an Android software development kit (SDK) for devices like smartwatches.
In October, there were reports that the search giant was working on its own branded smartwatch . But according to the Wall Street Journal , Google wants to provide developers with a "vision" for their own wearables via Android, much like it does with smartphones and tablets.

According to the Journal, Google intends to release its SDK well before products actually hit the shelf, hoping to earn "plenty of feedback" from developers, Pichai said. Google is hosting its annual I/O developer conference from June 25-26 , so it is possible we'll see some hardware then.
This is just the beginning of Google's wearable plans, though. Pichai tipped a future that could include an Android-powered "smart jacket" with built-in sensors.
The executive also commented on Chromecast sales, which are "in the millions." The dongle launched initially in the U.S., but will be rolling out to additional countries soon.

Not just for Glasswipes: Google to drop SDK for all Android wearables
Choc Factory starts 14-day countdown to devkit rollout
10 Mar 2014 at 13:32, Brid-Aine Parnell
SXSW Google is preparing to release a new SDK for makers of wearable devices in the hope of running Android into a myriad of accessories.
Top exec Sundar Pichai told the South by Southwest conference yesterday that the company is prepping the software development kit for release in the next two weeks, the Wall Street Journal and others reported.
"In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android," Goog's senior veep of Android, Chrome and Apps said. "That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working."
While Google already has its "Glass" and is also planning a smartwatch of its own, which will be made by partner LG, the Chocolate Factory also wouldn't mind if lots of other hardware companies were to stick Android in their wearables as well, considering the model has worked so well in mobiles.
The Chocolate Factory's release of Android as a free-to-use OS for smartphones has helped the company gobble market share in the sector at an enormous rate and given it good working relationships with manufacturers. In turn, this has helped it create its own line of Nexus mobile devices without having to build its own factories.
Mountain View is planning to unveil its own smartwatch at a Google developer event in June, as CNET reported last month. But the firm is hoping that by releasing wearable-friendly Android into the wild, developers will be able to come up with a wide range of devices, including "smart jackets" with embedded sensors, Pichai suggested.
The executive also said that Google is thinking about using recent acquisition Nest Labs , a smart thermostat maker, to help it develop a "mesh layer" of software that will make all its devices work better together.

Google Chromecast has just hit its second birthday, and to celebrate the occasion Google is offering users of the streaming dongle a few free gifts. Up until December 31, Chromecast owners (whether new or existing) will get free film rentals on Google Play (including HD films) and a free 90-day sub to Google Play Music.
While the offer is sure to appeal to those who already own a Chromecast, it's also clear that this is a bid to tempt new buyers into what's already a very tempting proposition in the first place - the Chromecast ha been quite a successful device with Google reporting over 10 million sales inside 2014.
A lot of its success had to do with Google s pricing   it cost just  30   a very attractive price considering the gizmo s impressive capabilities, which turn any dumb HDTV into a web-connected  smart  TV. 
As Chromecast snowballed, more and more publishers began to add support. And as more publishers added support, Chromecast s popularity grew even more. The snowball effect rolled on and on and then, eventually, the dongle made its way over to the UK with BBC iPlayer support in tow. 
Chromecast, along with things like the Roku Streaming Stick, represent an easy and cost effective means of turning an HDTV into a web-connected smart TV. Most of the reason why they re so popular is because TV manufacturers, like their friends in the car industry, are far too slow when it comes to rolling out technology in their products.
Google highlighted quite a few Chromecast milestones in its recent earnings call. According to the Big G s Chief Business Officer, Omid Kordenstani, there have now been over ONE BILLION casts made since Google first launched Chromecast. Usage of Chromecast has also increased by 60% since its initial release date and, if that wasn t enough, Google also confirmed that Chromecast is now the most popular media streamer in the US. 
SmartTVs, while widely available, are still something of a luxury for many, with prices ranging into thousands of pounds right down to the  600 mark. Eventually, all HDTVs will be smart, web-connected units. But until this fateful day arrives, those of us not willing to part with obscene amounts of money for an idiot box, can now, at least, bridge the gap with awesome solutions like Google s Chromecast.
And there s going to be a follow-up device too. Speaking at GigaOm's Structure Connect conference, Google VP of product management Mario Queiroz hinted that a new version is in the works, but neglected to say when the Chromecast 2 would launch    although early 2015 seems most likely. 
Here s an extract from the report:  Queiroz wouldn t say much about what Google is planning for the second iteration of Chromecast. But he did indicate that Google is  building an ecosystem of different endpoints  in which the Chromecast is one endpoint and other  Chromecast devices  are other endpoints. 
 I can say we really want to bring the richness of this first screen second screen experience to life,  said Queiroz.  The hardware capabilities will give us a better opportunity to take full advantage of a large screen paired with a small screen. 
Google Chromecast review: Design
The Chromecast is a truly tiny device, weighing around 30g and looking a lot like a USB memory stick, albeit one with an HDMI connector at the end. This allows it to slot directly into the back of your TV (although there s an extender cable inside the box if you want to place it elsewhere). 
It also requires a USB connection for power, and the cable can either slot into your TV s port, should it have one (probably the tidiest option) or into the wall using the supplied AC adapter. It s a shame the thing can t draw its energy through the HDMI connection, as this would essentially make it a totally wireless product and cut down on the mass of cables collecting behind your TV. 
The Chromecast does not, however, require a wired Internet connection, as it connects to your home network and hence the web via b/g/n Wi-Fi.
There s no supplied remote control, as part of the Chromecast s design is that you use a companion device   a smartphone, tablet or computer   for choosing content to watch and controlling playback. Sound and video works, albeit with some lag and, for the latter, stuttering. To be fair to Google, the web-casting feature is still officially in beta mode, so there s definite room for   and an expectation of   improvement in the near future.
Google Chromecast review: Full Specs
Output: HDMI, CEC compatible
Max. Output Video Resolution: 1080p
Dimensions: 72(L) x 35(W) x 12(H) mm
Weight: 34 g
Wireless: 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n
Power: USB (Power adapter included)
Supported Operating Systems: Android 2.3 and higher, iOS  6 and higher, Windows  7 and higher, Mac OS  10.7 and higher, Chrome OS (Chromebook Pixel, additional Chromebooks coming soon).
Google Chromecast review: User interface
Set-up could not be simpler. After getting the Chromecast connected to your Wi-Fi network (you do this using a smartphone or computer and follow on-screen instructions; it takes perhaps three or four minutes in total), it s very much good to go.
To watch a video, you ll need an iPhone, iPad, Android device or a computer running Windows, Mac OS or Chrome OS. So should you want to watch a film on Netflix, you ll need bring up the Netflix app on your phone, or open Netflix in your Chrome web browser, choose whatever it is you want and then hit the  cast  icon that should now be on the screen. You ll be asked which device you d like the video cast to, and once you ve selected the film will start playing on your TV. 
If you have a TV with CEC-compliant HDMI ports, the Chromecast will even turn on the TV and switch it to the correct input channel. 
Playback can then be controlled from the device that was used to select and start the video. It s not a perfect system   there s a slight delay from the moment you press something and the action taking place, and there s also the possibility of you forgetting which device you used to start off playback, what with us having so many computers, phones and tablets in our houses these days   but it works well enough and keeps the price down.
To cast a web tab, you need to add an extension to Chrome. This results in a cast button appearing in the top right of the browser window. Hit this and the tab will appear on your TV.
Google has also added 10 new channels to Chromecast, bulking up the $35 HDTV dongle s arsenal of shows substantially. As of December 10, you can now stream the following channels on Google s uber affordable HDTV dongle: VEVO, Red Bull.TV, Songza, PostTV, Viki, Revision 3 and BeyondPod.
 Casting    the art of beaming photos and videos from your phone/tablet to Chromecast   has also been made easier via the inclusion of Plex, RealPlayer Cloud and Avia. Not seeing these new features yet? Don t worry, Google says they ll all be live within the next few days (so by Dec 13th, latest). 
Google Chromecast review: Performance
Video playback supports up to 1080p quality, although this depends on the source material and the speed of your broadband: older YouTube videos at 240p will look pretty ropey and soft, while new Netflix material like Orange Is The New Black is gloriously sharp and clean.
If your broadband speed isn t up to much, the Chromecast will use adaptive streaming to avoid buffering, and this can also result in softer, non-HD images (we never experienced this, but in theory it could happen).
5.1 Surround Sound is supported by Chromecast but without a dedicated audio output you ll need a TV with a digital audio output of some kind to experience it.
Google Chromecast review: Services
Google teamed up with the BBC for the launch of Chromecast in the UK, confirming full support for the TV Corporation s popular iPlayer application. As well as iPlayer, Chromecast features a raft of other services   all the Google ones, of course   as well as things like Real Player Cloud, a service that allows you to store videos in the cloud and then Cast them, via an app on your phone/tablet to a Chromecast-connected HDTV.
Other notable new additions include: AllCast, Plex, Avia Media Management and, if you fancy a bit of old school gaming, Tic Tac Toe. The Chromecast SDK is now open to developers, meaning there ll be plenty more applications and content on the way very soon. Bizarrely, both Channel 4 and ITV have said they have no immediate plans to support the service. For shame!
VLC App To Receive Chromecast Support Soon
Reports are emerging that the VLC app will soon be updated with full Chromecast support across Android, Windows, iOS and OS X.
 The popular VLC media player will be upgraded to version 3.0 soon,  reports 9to5Google ,  introducing a whole host of features to the software, including support for Google s Chromecast streaming device. The change was mentioned in a VLC change log on the VideoLan website. 
VLC's near-universal codec support means users with the updated app will be able to stream near any media file from pretty much any device using the above OSes to a connected Chromecast TV.
We still don't know the exact launch date, but media fans should expect something to appear in the not-too-distant future.
VideoStream
VideoStream  is a simple web-app that lets you stream any type of video, regardless of codec, straight from your PC to your Chromecast-connected HDTV. Once downloaded, the VideoStream extension is installed within Chrome, which means you don t have to bother with additional software   this is all that s required. VideoStream supports local video files stored on your PC and your home network, so you can leverage content from things like a connected NAS drive. There s also a remote control app available via Google Play for free, so you don t even need to open your PC once the app is running. 
Google Chromecast review: Conclusion
The Chromecast is, for the money, an incredibly tempting deal for anyone with Netflix, or a love for YouTube, and the inability to watch these on their TV. It s easy to setup, even easier to use and we ve found it reliable in our couple of weeks of using it. Web casting is a little spottier, but hopefully this will improve as it moves out of beta. 
If, however, you already own a smart TV, an Apple TV or one of many devices that already allow YouTube, Netflix and other video streaming, it s hard to see the appeal of this little dongle. It s likely to find its place in the home of late adopters rather than those who are well equipped with the most recent of tech products.

Software development kit which lets Android developers create apps and services for devices such as Google Glass will be released in two weeks
Google has announced that it is releasing a software development kit (SDK) to allow developers to create apps running its Android operating system for wearable technology devices .
At the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, the company s senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps, Sundar Pichai , told an audience that an SDK will be available in a fortnight s time.
 In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android ,  Pichai said.  That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working. 
Growing interest
There has been growing speculation that Google is planning to launch a smartwatch as it looks to enter what has become a fast-growing market, with the release of an SDK a major indication that such a device may arrive soon.
Several manufacturers that currently use Android in their smartphones have also announced plans to release wearable technology devices in the near future. This includes HTC, which demonstrated several wearable product s in secret at the recent Mobile World Congress, and has pinpointed the sector as vital to restoring the company s flagging fortunes.
Motorola, which was recently sold by Google to Chinese manufacturer Lenovo, has also said it plans to have a collection of wearable technology products on sale by the end of the year .
 It s our intention to deliver some interesting wearable products this year,  said Motorola s senior vice president Rick Osterloh, although he said that the devices were still very much in the development stage and was unable to provide any details on release dates or price.
One issue that the announcement may raise is the fear that technology such as Google Glass may be used for nefarious or illegal purposes. Pichai looked to address these fears recently at Mobile World Congress, stating in an interview that he believed it was the open nature of the Android software which made it safe to use.
 Android was built to be very, very secure,  he said.  I would argue that it s the best way for a platform to be secure, because every researcher in the world can inspect it, every developer in the world can inspect it, and I think that contributes a lot to Android security .
The company s Glass technology, which offers users a head-up display view of various apps and services, has garnered major press interest during its trial phase, but has attracted controversy regarding the reaction from some law enforcement agencies and members of the public. The company recently released a set of recommendations for Glass users, which describe how one should behave while wearing the device following feedback from beta testers, warning them not to be  glassholes  .

Google is preparing to launch a software development kit for wearable devices later this month, as it encourages hardware firms to use Android in their smart watches, fitness trackers and other gadgets.
The plans were announced by the company s senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps, Sundar Pichai, at the SXSW conference in Austin.
 In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables,  said Pichai, after outlining Google s vision of the wearable technology market.
 When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform. We see a world of sensors... Sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors. 
He added that while smart watches and fitness gadgets are the two most obvious wearable categories, Google hopes that releasing its SDK will stimulate the development of a host of new devices.  I think we re just scratching the surface,  he said.
However, Pichai   who added Android to his responsibilities in 2013 when its founder Andy Rubin moved on to other projects within Google   gave no hint about the company s plans to make its own hardware.  From my standpoint and the team s standpoint, we want to focus on the platform and the APIs. 
At SXSW, Pichai was interviewed on-stage by entrepreneur and investor John Battelle, who pressed him for details of Google s Android licensing program   particularly reports of hidden clauses that require partners to set specific Google services as the default (search for example) if they want access to its core applications.
 Android is one of the most open systems I ve ever seen. What makes Android great is it s literally designed from the ground up to be customised in a very powerful way,  said Pichai, who pushed back on the idea that Google is too controlling.
 We do have business relationships, we do do licensing relationships and people want to use Google services on top of Android. But in theory you can use Android without Google. If you do a licensing arrangement, we do require our services to be installed, but it s not exclusive   you can preload any other services you want. 
He was later pressed on the issue by an audience member, who noted that manufacturers setting certain non-Google apps as default on their Android devices would be barred from using its crown jewels.
 None of what we do is ever exclusive. Yes, we may require some services  but you are fully free as an OEM or carrier or partner to place other services on the phone,  he said, before declining to go into more details.  I can t comment on specific things  these are business deals that you do on a partner-by-partner basis. 
The interview focused on various aspects of Google s business, including the company s recent $3.2bn acquisition of thermostat maker Nest , and how it fits into Google s software strategy. Battelle wondered whether Nest s products will integrate Chrome or Android, before jabbing  Will we have to join Google+ to turn off our thermostat? 
 Definitely not the second one!  said Pichai, who added that Google is focusing on an ecosystem spanning these devices and more.  We need a mesh layer, and a data layer in which this all comes together,  he said  We are thinking hard about the layer which will connect all these devices together. 
Pichai was asked about messaging app WhatsApp, which is being bought by Facebook for up to $19bn , but which is rumoured to have either fielded an alternative offer from Google, or agreed to notify the company if it was in acquisition talks with other big tech firms.
 We met with them recently. We were definitely interested in seeing them. They are one of the most successful companies on Android  But we did not make an offer to acquire them,  said Pichai, who said Google merely told WhatsApp that it was one of the major players within the Android ecosystem, offering unspecified  help  if required.
And the acquisition?  To me it s evidence that the platform is working at scale,  he said.  This signifies that the smartphone platform is fundamentally changing how we communicate. 
The interview also touched on Chrome OS versus Android, with Pichai maintaining that Google has no immediate plans to merge the two.  We view them as building blocks. By investing in both, we believe that over time we will be able to meet almost all use cases,  he said.  We feel fortunate to have both. 
He declined to give a specific sales figure for Google s Chromecast USB dongle for TVs, but said Google is excited by its performance so far.  We are in the millions now, and it s growing very actively,  he said, while promising Chromecast will go on sale in  many more countries  in a few weeks  time.

Google Chromecast UK release coming within weeks
Google Chromecast
The Google Chromecast UK release date could happen within the coming weeks, according to Google.
Speaking during the SXSW conference this week, Android Chief Sundar Pichai said the Chromecast would be released in  many more countries  before the end of the month.
Google originally released the Chromecast HDMI streaming dongle in July 2013 alongside the Google Nexus 7 2 announcement.
The device was then opened up to developers with a special SDK in February this year, to expand the device s app compatibility.
Pichai added that customers have already purchased  millions  of Chromecast, but failed to outline specific sales figures.
Earlier rumours also suggested that the device would launch outside the US in March, but these were originally dismissed by Google.
However, it seems those rumours were spot on after all.
Google Chromecast Features
The Chromecast is an HDMI media streaming dongle that plugs directly into any HDTV. It allows you to stream services like Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies and Google All Access Music from your smartphones and tablets to your TV over Wi-Fi.
It runs on a simplified version of Chrome OS and pulls content from the cloud rather than your smart device, meaning multiple users can interact with the content at any one time.
Google has made sure the Chromecast is compatible with Full 1080p HD streaming and 5.1 surround sound so you don t lose out on any quality when streaming.
Not only is it fully compatible with Android devices, but tehre s also an iOS app in the App Store to attempt to ape the AirPlay offerings.

Google wants to make it easier for lots of wearables to run on the Android operating system.
In about two weeks, the tech giant will release an Android software-development kit (SDK) for wearable devices. This comes from Sundar Pichai, Google s senior vice president of Android, Chrome, and apps, today at South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.
 We ll lay out a vision for developers as to how we ll see this market working,  Pichai said, according to a report from The Verge.
Sure, Google has turned out the Glass wearable device, but lots of other companies, like OnBeep or Vuzix , have been working on wearables, too. They might be running different operating systems. So developers writing apps on those operating systems are essentially working in isolation, not inside a common ecosystem.
Wearables will be a big topic of discussion at our upcoming VentureBeat Mobile Summit on April 14 to April 15 at Cavallo Point Resort in Sausalito, Calif. It s an invite-only gathering of 180 top mobile executives. 
A common SDK could lighten the burden on wearable makers to do everything on their own.
 We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,  Pichai said in The Verge report.
At the same time, the move could turn Google into the enabler of a wearable platform, just as it s made Android a common platform for mobile phones and tablets, alongside Apple. Perhaps Apple will want to cook up a wearable SDK of its own soon, to keep Google from running away with wearable market.

Chromecast Streaming Stick Coming To More Countries In Weeks
Flushed with the success of it s HDMI wireless dongle, Google are set to unleash the Chromecast mini stick to more Countries soon.
Speaking at South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Texas, Google s chief of Android, Chrome and Google Apps, Sundar Pinchai, said that the Chromecast would be arriving in  many more countries  within the next few weeks.
The Chromecast which launched last summer in America, has sold  millions  of units, and the pace of sales are rising. Pinchai didn t reveal which countries the stick will be launching in, or the price, he did indicate it would be launching within weeks.
The dongle which plugs straight into any HDTV s HDMI socket and offers wireless streaming from apps and browsers, is said to be heading to the UK this month, so it may well be that a launch worldwide will happen at the same time.
The Chromecast costs $35 in the US, and it would be expected to be at a slightly higher price point elsewhere as with most hardware . It should still come in cheaper than the equally desirable but costlier Roku Streaming Stick , which is available to pre-order at $50.

Sundar Pichai, Google s SVP for Android, Apps and Chrome, announced at SXSW 2014 that an Android developer SDK specifically designed for wearable devices will be released in the next two weeks.
 In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android,  Pichai said .  That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working. 
Though the smartwatch market or wearable tech market in general hasn t achieved the sales growth of smartphones and tablets, Juniper Research stated that it will expand rapidly in the next years. The firm projected that the wearable tech market will hit $1.4 billion by the end of the year, before reaching $19 billion by 2018.
One of the reasons wearable tech hasn t achieved the same level of popularity as smartphones and tablets is because we re yet to see a device that is both functional and fashionable. Most wearable tech devices cater to sporty types, or those who engage in lots of physical activity, thus they are quite bulky and the aesthetics aren t that impressive. But as brands realize that they need to appeal to more types of people, not only those who are interested in getting fit or healthy, and deliver something that nobody will hesitate to wear everyday, like a piece of jewelry, the market will boom. Besides, not everyone wants other people to know that they are wearing a piece of technology, some want it to be hidden or blend well with their wardrobe, like the Kickstarter project Ring, or the Cuff .
It also doesn t help that more and more establishments are banning the use of Google Glass in their premises, in order to protect their patrons  privacy   this even before the device rolls out to the general public. If people are going to be shunned from public places for the  technology they re wearing on their face, what s the point of what s the point of buying it when you ve got no place to go?
Still, Google isn t backing out of the wearable tech market by any means   the search giant is also said to be on the verge of unveiling a smartwatch-centric operating system later this month. The smartwatch OS will be used to power a device Google is building in collaboration with LG, and is set to be unveiled at the forthcoming Google I/O conference this June.

Google (GOOG) to Release an SDK For Wearable Devices in Two Weeks: Report
March 10, 2014 WSP
Speaking at this year s SXSW conference, Google (GOOG) s SVP of Android, Chrome & Apps Sundar Pichai said the search giant will release an Android-based software development kit [SDK] that will make it easier for companies to create wearable devices that run on Google  OS.
By focusing on wearables at a platform level, Google is clearly aiming at making its technology accessible to a wide variety of wearable devices.
 When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,  Pichai said.  It s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket   with sensors   I don t know , reported Re/code.
The SDK will be available in two weeks, added Pichai, without hinting at whether Google will be building its own smart watch, as many expect.
The news comes ahead of Google s I/O developer s conference in June, where the Mountain View, Calif.-based company is expected to unveil its own smart watch developed in collaboration with LG electronics. According to Forbes  Amit Chowdhry,  the LG smart-watch is believed to have always-on access to Google Now so that you can speak commands any time and receive feedback right away. 
Google s latest push into wearable technology comes as Samsung, the largest maker of Android smartphones and the world s top smartphone maker, switched to a new OS for its latest wearable devices. Samsung s Gear 2 smartwatches run on Tizen s open-sourced OS, a rival mobile software platform created by a consortium led by the Korean electronics manufacturer, Intel (INTC) and a group of telecom operators.

Google taps LG for Nexus 6: Everything we think we know about the next Nexus
10 March 2014, 7:24 am EDT By Malarie Gokey Tech Times
A new report from Germany suggests that LG will make the upcoming Nexus 6 smartphone. Google partnered with LG on the previous version, the Nexus 5. So far, we don't know a whole lot about the Nexus 6, but we have a few ideas.  ( Karlis Dambrans )

For a mid-range smartphone series, Google's Nexus lineup sure elicits a lot of speculation and anticipation. The Nexus 5 arrived to blow our minds just last year, but now rumors are already swirling around the next Nexus: the Nexus 6.
A new report from Germany hints that LG will once again be tapped as the manufacturer behind Google's Nexus smartphone. LG made last year's Nexus 5 and the Nexus 4, too. So far, every time LG has made a Nexus smartphone for Google, it has been a huge hit with customers. The Nexus 5 famously sold out of the Google Play Store shortly after it was launched.
It looks like Google wants to repeat that success and will pass over other manufacturers yet again, preferring to  stick with LG, if this latest report is to be believed. After all, don't fix what isn't broken, right?
At this point, we still know next to nothing about the Nexus 6, but there are a lot of  rumors  out there, which hint that the Nexus 6 will be a pretty awesome device - again.
In terms of form factor, the Nexus 6 is expected to be thinner and lighter with almost no bezels at all, giving it the much-sought after edge-to-edge display. Rumors regarding the display's size and resolution have been all over the place. Some reports even claim that the Nexus 6 will feature a Quad HD, 2K display with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels. The size of the display will supposedly be 5.2-inches.
However, given the fact that the Nexus smartphones are typically priced lower than the flagship devices made by other companies, a 2K display seems unlikely. Samsung didn't even put one on the Galaxy S5, so why should LG and Google do so with the Nexus 6? Of course, with Google, anything is possible, but it seems a little far-fetched.
As far as hardware and software go, rumors point to a 64-bit processor and a 16-megapixel back camera. The Nexus 6 will undoubtedly run the newest version of Android when it launches and that's all we know, or think we know.
The Nexus 6 release date is also shrouded in mystery. Google's Sundar Pichai stated that it won't arrive in the first half of 2014 and some reports hint that it might not even arrive by October. Needless to say, no one has any clue about when the Nexus 6 will be announced. Chances are we won't know too much about the device until right before it launches. Google loves to surprise us, so expect the Nexus 6 to be a real doozy.

Google to release software development kit for wearables
Joe Minihane - 10 March 2014

Google has confirmed it will release a software development kit (SDK) for wearable devices. The search giant s head of Android, Sundar Pichai, revealed the news overnight during a Q&A at SxSW.
The SDK, which will be available to use within two weeks, is aimed at developers who want to create apps for the growing number of smartwatches and fitness bands that use Google s Android software.
At the moment, apps for these devices are largely limited to the native add ons that are built-in by manufacturers.
But with the wearables space about to boom, it appears Google is desperate to capitalise, especially ahead of the release of Apple s iWatch later this year .
Interestingly, Pichai didn t just talk up smartwatches. He says this new SDK will be aimed at any kind of kit that can pick up data when on your body.
That means anything from Android jewellery to Google Glass style specs could potentially use the software.
Pichai did not commit to any timescale for the release of any Google wearables. Google Glass is edging closer to commercial availability, with a Nexus smartwatch also rumoured.

The most popular smartphone operating system is now coming to wearables.
Speaking at a conference at South by Southwest, Google executive Sundar Pichai stated that the company plans to release a software development kit (SDK) based on Android for makers of wearable devices, such as smartwatches,  in two weeks.
Although the company plans to release its own smartwatch, in conjunction with LG, Google s SDK is intended for other developers to power their own wearable devices.
As with its mobile strategy, the spread of Android is Google s primary concern here   with the wearable SDK allowing the services it offers packaged with Android to reach even further, via other manufacturers  hardware.
According to the  WSJ, Pichai said Google is releasing its Android software developer kit for wearable devices well before actual devices hit the market so the company gets  plenty of feedback  first.
Therefore, it s possible Google is hoping to garner feedback for continued development of its own smartwatch device, as part of the SDK initiative.
It s not just smartwatches Google has its eye on here either. The  WSJ  reports  Pichai saying the company hopes its Android platform helps developers create many types of wearable devices   with Pichai apparently throwing out  a sensor-laden, Android-powered  smart jacket  scenario as one possibility.
Asked about the recent acquisition of smart thermostat maker Nest Labs, Pichai said Google is thinking about creating a  mesh layer  of software to make its various devices work better together.
The release of Google s smartwatch has been slated for either mid to late March, or pushed out to June (although the company has not confirmed its plans).

Google will launch a new version of Android designed to work on wearable devices within the next fortnight.
"In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android [wearables]," Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Android, Apps and Chrome said at the SXSW conference in Texas. "That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working."
That vision goes beyond smartwatches, which have been the dominant form of wearable technology over the past year, and one in which Google has lost ground. Samsung recently dumped Android for the more lightweight Tizen OS on the Galaxy Gear 2 , but Google hopes the new version of Android will be used in a much wider range of devices.
The company has, of course, already released beta versions of the Google Glass headset, which runs on Android. It has also reportedly commissioned LG to build a Nexus-branded smartwatch, which may be announced alongside the release of the SDK later this month.
Google bought smartwatch maker WIMM Labs last year, which released a device running on Android 2.1.
However, it's likely that Google also has its eye on the lucrative fitness tracker market, with devices such as the Fitbit Flex bands, Jawbone UP and Nike FuelBand now well established in the market.
Smart clothing is another potential outlet for an embedded version of Android. "When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly," Pichai said, according to a report on Re/code . "It s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket... with sensors   I don t know."

Google has announced that it will release a software development kit (SDK) for use with wearable devices, making it easier for developers to create Android apps for smartwatches and other gadgets.
Speaking at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Texas on Sunday, Google executive Sundar Pichai said the SDK, which will be released in two weeks, will "lay out a vision for developers of how we see this market working .
Following the launch of a range of new smartwatches from Samsung and Sony at Mobile World Congress last month, Google is rumoured to be developing its own smartwatch in collaboration with LG, which also makes its Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 smartphones.
However, the new SDK will not only be for smartwatches. Pichai said that it will be up to the developers themselves to decide which devices to focus on.
"When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,  said Pichai, according to a report in re/code .  It s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket with sensors   I don t know.

Google wants Android to dominate wearables, like it does smartphones
The internet giant will release new protocols this month for conencting wearable sensors to its popular mobile operating system

The Independent Tech
Samsung's Galaxy Gear and Gear Fit wearable devices - both of which run on Android
Google has announced new plans to promote Android wearable technology, hoping to position the operating system as the default platform for smart devices in the same way that it already is for smartphones.
 We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,  said Google s senior vice president of Android and Chrome Sundar Pichai at the SXSW conference in Texas, reported The Verge .
The internet gant will release a new software development kit (SDK) for wearable sensors this month, allowing this technology to more easily communicate with the Android operating system.
Although Android already has a presence in the wearables market through a number of smartwatches that operate on the OS (and, of course, through Google Glass) Picai stressed that the company s vision extends to more exotic devices, which might include smart clothing.
Pichai also hinted that this new  mesh layer  of communications between Android and various sensors might incorporate the home automation devices built by Nest, the company that Google acquired in January this year for $3.2bn ( 2bn) .
Nest has so far only produced two products   a smart thermostat and a fire alarm   but has been praised for the quality of its design and for intuitive software that  learns  users  habits.
Pichai said that he sees a parallel between the smartphone ecosystem and the wearables ecosystem. While smartphones became tiny computers, wearables will become hubs for information about the real world fed by various sensors.
However, in some ways smartphones are already usurping this territory. Just last month two products were launched that took the brains inside a normal smartphone and used them to power new sensors.

Google on wearables: 'We re just scratching the surface'
Google releases new tools for next generation Android wearables
Published 6:36 PM, March 10, 2014
Updated 2:35 PM, March 12, 2014
MANILA, Philippines   With the tech community shifting its focus towards wearable computers, Google wants to make sure Android remains the OS of choice in the wearable space.
At the start of SXSW Interactive Android Chief Sundar Pichai announced a new wearable software development kit (SDK) for Android, available in two weeks. Along with the release of the new SDK Google also promises to unveil its  vision  of what the wearable technology market will shape up to be.
While Pichai didn t go into much detail he pointed out that the SDK will allow developers to harvest data from a variety of body-mounted sensors. "Sensors can be smart and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. 
While the market is currently dominated by fitness bands and watches Pichai says that with the new SDK, Google hopes developers will think about other devices.  I think we re just scratching the surface,  he said.
Previous reports point to a Google smartwatch supposedly arriving at Google I/O later this year, but Pichai says it will take a while before Google announces wearables of its own. "From my standpoint and the team s standpoint, we want to focus on the platform and the APIs."
Google s announcement comes after the Mobile World Congress where Samsung announced a range of wearable computers but ditched Android in favor of open-source operating system Tizen.   Rappler.com

Google's Sundar Pichai confirmed the company was planning to release an Android developer SDK specifically  designed for smartwatches and wearables, with aims of launching in the next few weeks
Google may or may not be working on a smartwatch of its own, but it's about to get easier for other manufacturers to make wearable technology using the company's Android operating system.  Sundar Pichai, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome, confirmed that an Android SDK developed specifically for wearables and smartwatches would be arriving in the coming weeks.
Making the announcement at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas, Pichai said the SKD will make it much easier for companies to make Android-powered wearables, although he declined to mention whether Google was working on any wearable devices itself. Instead, he said the company was approaching wearables on a "platform level", meaning a focus on hooking the sensors normally found in smartwatches, such as altimeters, accelerometers and heart rate sensors, directly into the operating system at a basic level.
Google hopes that by standardising how those sensors transmit their data to Android, it will become the go-to operating system for other manufacturers. In its current form, Android isn't particularly well suited to wearables - so much so that Samsung opted to move from Android to a Tizen operating system for its second generation Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo smartwatches .
According to Pichai, "when we say we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly" than just smartwatches. Quite what the company has in mind is unclear, but if rumours of an LG-manufactured, Google-branded smartwatch turn out to be true, we could likely see smartwatches being the first of many different kinds of wearable technology in the near future.

By Roland Hutchinson
Wearable technology is going to be popular this year, with various manufacturers working on wearable device like smart watches , and now Google has announced they are launching and Android SDK for wearable devices in two weeks.
We previously heard that Google were working on their own smart watch, as yet there are still no official details on this device, although we suspect we may hear more about this after the Android SDK for wearable devices is launched.
The news was announced at SXSW by Google s Sundar Pichai, who told the SXSW Conference that Google will release an Android SDK for wearable devices like smart watches in two weeks time.
Sundar Pichai said that Google will provide a  vision for developers of how we see this market working , the company obviously has some serious plans for wearable technology.
As yet there are no specific details on this new Android SDK which is specifically designed for wearable technology, as soon as we get some more information we will let you guys know.

No Comments on Google to release Android SDK for wearables in two weeks
Google smartwatch mockup
As 2014 progresses, it is becoming clearer that wearables are here to stay and might very well turn out to be the next big thing.
With no clear OS reigning the wearables arena right now, it is an open race and Google doesn t want Android to be left behind. Google s SVP for Android, Apps and Chrome Sundar Pichai has announced that Google will be releasing an Android SDK specifically meant for wearables in the next two weeks. This SDK will allow developers to create apps for wearable devices running Android. Pichai notes that the SDK won t be limited to smartwatch apps and it will be upto developers and manufacturers to use it in the way they want and figure out new form factors.
 When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly,  Pichai said during a talk at SXSW in Austin, Texas.  It s for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket   with sensors   I don t know. 
Samsung s jump to Tizen in its latest crop of wearable devices has made it clear that Google will have to work hard to make manufacturers choose Android over any other platform for use in their wearable devices. The upcoming release of SDK for wearables is a right step in that direction. If there are apps for wearables on Android, manufacturers will be more likely to choose it as the platform in their wearables. Nobody wants the pain to start a platform and build an ecosystem from scratch.
The release of SDK at this time also makes sense for Google if the company is indeed going to launch a smartwatch around Google I/O 2014 , as it will give developers some time to build their apps.
Pichai also reiterated at SXSW that Chromecast will soon be heading to international markets but did not specify an exact date.

Google has confirmed that it plans to launch a software development kit in the next two weeks that will allow third-party developers to create Android software for use on wearable computing devices. The news was confirmed by Google's head of Chrome and Android, Sundar Pichai at SXSW (South By Southwest Interactive Festival) 2014.
Sundar Pichai, during a panel discussion at SXSW 2014, stated that a new SDK would be released by Google which is designed to help developers create Android apps for devices like smartwatches and fitness bands. He also stated that Android SDK for wearable's would help developers take advantage of current and emerging sensor technology. Google had previously released similar SDKs for Android for automobiles, televisions and tablets. Pichai likened the wearable technology to the smartphone revolution and stated that the goal was to take Android beyond tablets and smartphones to a multi-screen world.
"In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android that will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working," Pichai said.
Google is reportedly working with LG to produce a smartwatch that will make a debut at Google's I/O developer's conference in June. Pichai added that Google is releasing its Android SDK for wearable's ahead of actual devices in order to get "plenty of feedback," as the internet giant's smartwatch will likely be the first device to run on the new software. According to reports, the new mobile operating system will integrate the company's Google Now voice assistant and search feature. Google will go up against Samsung Galaxy Gear and Apple's rumored iWatch with its new LG Nexus smartwatch.

Don't Fall Behind
Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends
Google s SVP of Android, Apps and Chrome Sundar Pichai has been speaking at SXSW Interactive, and the headline news from his on-stage slot is the arrival of a new Android Software Development Kit (SDK) for wearable devices. That means Android app developers can start writing programs to be used in fitness trackers, smart wristbands and other wearable devices.
It s no secret that Google wants Android to be running on just about every device possible. In Google Glass the company already has a wearable headset of its own running Android, and the mobile OS will spread to a whole new set of hardware with the launch of the SDK.
 When we think of wearables, we think of it as a platform,  said Pichai, as reported by the Guardian .  We see a world of sensors  sensors can be small and powerful, and gather a lot of information that can be useful for users. We want to build the right APIs for this world of sensors. 
 In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables,  Pichai went on to say.  I think we re just scratching the surface.  No specific products or gadgets were mentioned, but the Googler did confirm that the focus was on wearable technology incorporating various different body sensors   imagine a Google Now alert when your heart is beating a little too fast, perhaps.
There were plenty of other interesting nuggets of information in Pichai s interview and Q&A session at SXSW. The SVP confirmed that Chromecast was selling well and would expand to more countries in the near future; he also hinted that Google s heavily rumored YouTube-based music service is still on the cards.
 For us, the amount of music consumed through YouTube is very, very interesting,  said Pichai, though he stopped short of confirming that a new service was in the pipeline.  To us, we see the synergies in how people play music and consume music in YouTube can be brought together in an interesting way. I think we can enhance the music experience for users.

Google wants to mimic Android s success on smartphones and tablets in the emerging wearables market. To this end it is launching a set of developer tools which make it easier for manufactures to run the OS on wearable devices. While talking at the South by Southwest (SXSW) conference over the weekend, Sundar Pichai, Google s SVP of Android and Chrome, said that Google will release a developer SDK designed to make it easier for OEMs to create wearable devices that use Android.
Google hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices.
A key component to the new SDK is a new layer which will create a standard way for Android to collect data from sensors. One of the attractions of wearables is that lots of different types of data can be collected often via sensors that aren t traditionally found on smartphones or tablets. By creating a standardized way for the sensors to send their data to Android it means that the OS becomes sensor agnostic while providing a uniform way for that data to be read.   We want to develop a set of common protocols by which they can work together,  said Pichai,  they need a mesh layer and they need a data layer by which they can all come together. 
This move comes at a critical time for Android with regards to wearables. At MWC 2014 Samsung unveiled its latest wearable devices, the Gear 2 and the Gear Fit , both of which run Tizen , an alternative open source Linux based mobile operating system, rather than Android. By standardizing sensor collection OEMs can now opt for Android instead of alternative OSes.
By wearables Google means more than just smartwatches and fitness bands.  When we say wearables, we are thinking much more broadly,  said Sundar.  Google hopes the new SDK will enabled developers to create many types of wearable devices. Sundar even suggested a future with  smart jackets  that are loaded with sensors and powered by Android.
Google will release the new SDK in about two weeks time and is looking for  plenty of feedback  from developers. During the conference Sundar Pichai didn t say anything about any wearables which Google itself may release but instead emphasized that Google sees Android being used for wearables  at a platform level.  Of course the release of an SDK could be the prelude to one or more Google designed wearables including the often rumored Google Smartwatch.

Google set to launch Android for smartwatches

Google Nexus smartwatch concept
Google is ready to release a version of Android aimed specifically at wearable devices, it has announced.
Speaking at the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Texas over the weekend, Google s Sunday Pichai announced that the company is all set to launch a software development kit (SDK) for manufacturers of smartwatches and other wearable devices.
Naturally, Google will be making its own smartwatch, which is said to be a partnership with South Korean manufacturer LG . But as with its Nexus range of smartphones and tablets, this device will be a kind of reference design for other smartwatch manufacturers to riff off.
Pichai did note, however, that the smartwatch was only one example of wearable devices that could make use of the forthcoming SDK. Of course, Google already makes a different kind of wearable smart device in the shape of Google Glass, but Pichai mentioned his vision of a jacket containing multiple sensors as another possibility.
As with the stock Android SDK, this smartwatch SDK will be made free to manufacturers. It should launch in two weeks time.
Many smartwatch efforts up to this point, including the ill-received Samsung Galaxy Gear , have used heavily modified versions of the regular Android OS, which hasn t been optimised for smaller form factors.
It may be one reason Samsung turned to its own Tizen OS for its recent smartwatch follow-up, the Samsung Gear 2 , which was announced towards the end of last month.

It s quite rare for Google to comment on sales, but now we re getting some idea how the Chromecast dongle fared commercially. This info comes from Google SVP Sundar Pichai himself who said at SxSW that the number of streaming dongles sold reached millions.
Of course, there is no way we can verify that claim since exact sales figures are never made public. Even Pichai s  millions  is still on the vague side. We can only infer this success based on the reception and popularity that Google s streaming device has enjoyed ever since it launched in the market.
When the Chromecast was released in July, the device immediately sold out within just a day. Again, we will probably never know how many devices were in stock in the first place. We can only presume it was quite substantial, even after the number of times it went back in supply. That was despite the lack of sources of content back then.
Chromecast also became a trendsetter. It ushered in a new generation of portable devices that delivered streaming content, video or otherwise, to TVs not in boxes but in small, USB thumdrive-sized dongles. There was very little setup involved or space needed. Just plug it in to an HDMI port, as well as a USB port for power, and you re good to go.
The good news is that even if Pichai was only half right, the Chromecast success story is far from done. Google has recently made available its Cast SDK for Android app developers to take advantage of. And probably more importantly, also at SxSW , Pichai reiterated Google s commitment to make Chromecast officially available in more markets really soon. When that will take place, however, is still anyone s guess for now.

Android getting SDK for wearables
by
Email
Just weeks away
Android is about to get an SDK for wearables. According to Google Senior Vice President Dundar Pichai, the SDK will enable developers to make apps for wearables.
At first the effort will probably be limited to smart watches and wristbands, i.e. fitness trackers. Pichai said the SDK should launch in just two weeks time. He added that the goal is to take Android beyond smartphones and tablets, reports CNET . 
Google can be described as a pioneer in the field of wearables thanks to the Google Glass push. However, Google Glass was (and still is) more of a tech demo than an actual product. Google has yet to introduce truly affordable wearables with mass market appeal. In fact, nobody has.
Google is expected to roll out a smart watch later this year and there is talk of a cheaper Google Glass design, but we are still talking about vapourware at this point.

It might not be the Google smartwatch revelation that some might have been waiting for, but it might be the next best thing. Google SVP Sundar Pichai announced at SxSW that the company will be making available in two weeks a sofware development kit (SDK) based on Android that manufacturers and developers can use for their next hit smart something.
The description of the SDK is pretty generic and pretty vague. All Pichai says about it at this point is that it will help developers to take a couple of sensor data and combine them into something more usable. If that sounds like it could cover a wide range of sensors, applications, and devices, it is precisely because Google isn t limiting its vision to smart glasses and smartwatches alone.
The wearable device market is still in its infancy and there is still a lot of room for innovation. We have seen some of those at work, like contact lenses that assist diabetics monitor their sugar levels, shirts that help athletes keep track of their heart rates, or even clothing and accessories that alert parents to their baby s needs. None of these are devices you strap to your wrist or put on your head.
Google will be leaving it up to other parties to think of the use cases the SDK will be applied to. There is, however, still some lingering questions whether Google will be eating its own SDK dogfood for its rummored smartwatch or if it will use a slightly different software based on Google Now, as some rumors put it.

Google s Plan To Bridge The Gap With Wearables Starts With A New Android-Based SDK

Google is releasing an Android-based developer SDK aimed at the wearable segment by the end of this month.
After smartphones, wearables are clearly the biggest point of interest for major tech companies. The new segment is gaining tremendous significance with more companies joining the bandwagon. Google, world's largest internet company and the most dominating mobile OS maker, is not going down without a fight in the rapidly-growing wearable segment. Speaking at the SXSW (South by Southwest) conference  Sunday, Google's SVP of Android and Chrome, Sundar Pichai said that Google will be releasing a new developer SDK (software development kit) based on its popular Android platform to help companies create a wide range of wearable devices.
This will not only boost the emerging wearable segment, but help Google be a leader in yet another category. According to  The Verge , Pichai said the new Android-based SDK will be ready in two weeks but he was sketchy about the details.  Pichai said the SDK will serve as a platform for the sensors in the wearables to carry messages to the Android to function. With this, Google is looking at the bigger picture.
"When we say wearables we think about it much more broadly," Pichai said, according to  Re/Code . "It's for partners and developers to figure out. It could be a jacket ... with sensors - I don't know."
 The wearable segment is still in its infancy, but is witnessing technological innovations by the day. This new category goes beyond smartwatches, health tracking bands and eyewear.  Google is reportedly developing a new smart contact lens that will help wearers keep a tab on sugar levels. A shirt that helps track heart rates for athletes, clothes and accessories for babies to alert parents about their needs and more are on the anvil.  Google's role in these devices can be huge by giving a platform that companies and developers can use to create all kinds of wearable gadgets.
Pichai did not give any hints if Google will also be developing its own line of products based on the new SDK anytime soon, like its most recently rumored smartwatch. One thing for sure is that consumers will be treated with a variety of Android-based wearables in the near future.

Google to release Android SDK for wearable devices in two weeks
 
Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit
Wearable devices may have failed to garner much consumer interest, but this has not stopped giants like Google. The search giant seems to be ready to grab hold of what it expects to be the next big thing in consumer technology.
Google's Senior Vice President Sundar Pichai at the SXSW conference in Austin, Texas has revealed that the company will release a software development kit (SDK) in the coming two weeks that will allow developers to build Android software for wearable devices.
CNET quoted Pichai as saying, "In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android. That will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working."
Pichai also noted that the company aims to take the Android platform beyond smartphones and tablets.
In January, some leaked code was spotted that pointed to the development of an Android Fitness API to harness wearable devices. It was said that Google has been reportedly working on an API to allow developers to harness the potential of smartphone hardware.
The Android Fitness API was being speculated to enable the storage of data via multiple sources to the user's Google account. The apps could further show charts and other information from the data derived. It is, of course, not yet known whether the new API would arrive with the next Android release, or as a Google Play Service.
There have been earlier reports about Google working on a smartwatch of its own , a wearable device that could be revealed within the first half of this year.
Google's rumoured smartwatch is said to be manufactured by LG, which has been its OEM partner for Nexus smartphones ( Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 ) for two consecutive years.
Contradicting the wearable device trend an earlier report suggested that despite the hoopla, wearable gadgets like wristwatches for checking text messages or eyeglasses that can capture video are unlikely to make a splash with consumers anytime soon , given the clumsy designs, high prices and technological constraints of many of the current offerings.

Around a month ago, Google finally released the Chromecast SDK
. What this meant for us is that shiny new
Chromecast
apps would be coming down the pipe. And pipes they most certainly have come down! Here are some of the best (and most essential) apps for your Chromecast.
Stream Local Media on Your Phone: Allcast (Android, $4.99)
Allcast, created by Koush-a CynaogenMod Inc. developer and creator of ROM Manager, ClockworkMod Recovery and plenty of other apps-allows you to stream your photos, videos, and
music
from your Android device directly to Chromecast. The app has a bright and easy to use UI and, in addition to supporting the Chromecast, it also allows you to stream to your Xbox, Apple
TV
, Roku, or a number of other media receivers.
Mirror Your Phone's Display: Mirror (Android, root)
Screen mirroring on Android isn't the easiest thing to accomplish, nor is it all that useful on an everyday basis for most people. If you're in the group that does need it, though (and you have root access), Mirror can help you out. allows you to echo your phone's display on any Chromecast device.
Share Videos From Your Browser: Chrome Beta (Android)
Not content with allowing you to stream video from your browser on the desktop, Google is working on casting from Chrome itself. Right now, the feature is only available via Chrome Beta (and you have to manually enable it, as Android Police explains how to do here ) but once it's on, many video sources that haven't explicitly enabled video
streaming
support can be sent from your phone to your TV. Be forewarned that, as a beta feature of a beta app, it's pretty buggy right now, but it does work for some services.
Stream Networked Media: BubbleUPnP (Android, server on Windows/Mac/Linux)
If you were looking for a reason to see the Chromecast as something more than a toy, this might just be it. BubbleUPnP allows you to stream everything from your networked storage or media servers. The Android app itself allows you to send content on your phone to the Chromecast if it's in a supported format (P3, AAC, Vorbis, MP4 and MKV H264, images). However, you can also set up a BubbleUPnP server on a

Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is all set to release a software development kit for wearable devices towards the end of this month to enable the hardware firms to use Android in their smart watches, fitness trackers and other gadgets. Sundar Pichai, senior vice president of Android, Chrome and Apps announced this at the SXSW conference in Austin.
 In about two weeks, you will see us launch the first SDK for what we think of as Android for wearables,  said Pichai, after outlining Google s vision of the wearable technology market.
Google aiming the wearable tech market
He said that wearable s always need a platform. Sensors are small and powerful, and could collect a lot of information that can be useful for users. He added that the company is building the right APIs for this world of sensors. Pichai said that the smart watches and fitness gadget are the two most popular devices, in the wearable category. Keeping this in consideration, Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is expecting that SDK would enhance the development of a range of new devices.
Apple AirPods   Ways To Buy Them
Pichai kept silence on the Hardware subject, and gave no indication about the company making its own hardware. He said that from his point of view, as well as team s standpoint, it would be better to focus on the platform and API.
Chromecast sales number rising
When asked about the Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Chromecast devices, Pichai deferred from giving the exact sales number of the USB dongle for TVs, but added that Google is upbeat by the performance so far. Pichai said that the sales has reached in millions and increasing ahead. Pichai, also, said that Chromecast would be available in other countries, as well, in the coming weeks.
He said that the company has a business relationship, licensing relationship and users like to use Google services, in addition to the Android. However, it is not possible to use Android without Google.
Microsoft Surface Phone Will Not Debut Until 2019
Pichai took the responsibility of Android in 2013 after founder Andy Rubin moved to other projects inside the Google. Pichai, in his interview, said that Android is one of the most open systems, and it is designed from the ground to become a very powerful customizable platform. The senior executive denied that Google Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is too controlling.

Brace yourselves everyone, here comes the new Google Nexus 7, and other new Google devices. Some reports suggest that they could come as early as April, or a June/July release of this year.
Don't go dumping your Nexus device just yet, there are a lot things to consider such as the news about the new Google products being just educated guesses and rumors, but at the same time, a lot of the technology bloggers, and even the mainstream newspapers are all taking notice.
According to the Highlight Press , the market of size 7 tablets have become a deluge for Google. It wants to expand into an 8. Yes that's right, a Nexus 8. But the Nexus 8 will not be alone. Google intends to debut their long awaited Nexus 10 2; as well as debut the new Nexus 6, goodbye Nexus 5.

And there is even talk about the Android 4.5 or Android 5 operating system, with Lollipop and Key Lime Pie respectively. Whatever the last two are, Google's new devices sound delicious.
The Nexus 8 is expected to rival the iPad Mini, the NASDAQ an online technology and business site reported. Sources in Taiwan are said to expect initial shipments of two million units. 
The International Business Times reported that both ASUS and Google are looking to replace their Snapdragon computer chips, the ones that run the iPad, and have them run on the strongest Intel computer chip, Moorefield.
This is enough tech-talk to make Tony Stark's Iron Man jealous. But wait -- there's more: not only has it been reported that Google intends to debut new devices, there is talk that they will discontinue the Nexus line, the Times  reported. By discontinuing the Nexus line, Google wants to focus on their Google Play Edition.
The Nexus has three specific purposes, the Time reports. Firstly, it provides developers, Android and Google, with devices that they can show off Android at its best on. Secondly, Google can sell unlocked full-price devices directly to users. Thirdly, it provides mainstream users with the best of "pure Google" experience at the lowest cost possible.
The seed of Google speculation may have started when The Inquirer reported that Taiwanese phone maker HTC had been chosen, by Google, to build its next-gen tablet. This was reported on since Feb. 6, exactly one month ago.
HTC stated it has orders to make a high-end model of Google's tablet line, that they could be shipping in the third quarter of 2014, The Inquirer reported.
Google's proposed launch of their new Nexus products comes at a time when the Nexus sales have been low, and the market is saturated with similar looking tablets.
2014 for Google could be a good year.

Another hint that Google Chromecast is coming to Australia
Another hint that Google Chromecast is coming to Australia
It will be releasing in 'many more countries'
Shares
Google has finally said that it is soon planning to launch Chromecast , its cheap media streaming dongle outside of the US.
Google's Senior Vice President of Android, Chrome and Google Apps , Sundar Pinchai, said at SXSW that the company would be bringing Chromecast to "many more countries".
Pinchai did not reveal which countries would be in line to get the dongle or the pricing the rest of the world will be facing, he did indicate that it would be launching elsewhere within a few weeks.
Casting Down Under
While we've looked on in envy since Chromecast was launched in the US last year, this is our third indication that Google Chromecast will be coming to Australia in the last few weeks.
Reports emerged mid-February that Telstra has been in talks with Google in how it could bring Chromecast to Australia, and just last week the ABC indicated that it was readying itself for Chromecast as well.
But while Pinchai's comments have us believing that Chromecast has an Aussie future, we're still waiting on confirmation that Australia is on the list for a launch.
If you want to see what we'd be in for, here's our review of Chromecast

2013's Nexus 7 compared with this year's upcoming Nexus 8 /   Google/AndroidPIT
The Intel chip in question is called the Moorefield chip which is said to hum away at a top speed of around 2.33 GHz. If the Moorefield chip is used with the Nexus 8, it will also be very able when it comes to GPU muscle thanks to the PowerVR G6430 graphic engine.
Other reports seemed to indicate that the actual chip will be ready for bulk shipments soon. This may very well be as soon as Q3 of 2014 which is very much in line with the reported release date of the Nexus 8 tablet from Google and Asus. Word on the street is that Google may unveil the actual tablet during the Google I/O event as well as the next big upgrade to the Android software, which many are already dubbing lollipop. The tablet may then become available during the weeks following the event.
Apart from the speculation on what chip the Nexus 8 is likely to have and what the name of the Android version that will come with the phone is going to be there really isn t a whole lot more on the actual Nexus 8 device yet as far as specifications go. If Moorefield comes with the device though, we can probably expect some pretty impressive specs to come along with the affordable hardware that Google is known for delivering?
What do you think about the possibility of Google dumping the Snapdragon chips from Qualcomm for Intel s Moorefield? Please leave your comments below and we will get back to you.

Google Wearable SDK To Be Launched Soon For Third Party Developers
March 9, 2014 - Written By Justin Diaz
Some exciting news has come out of the SXSW( South by SouthWest event) this morning. It look as though Google may be looking to launch an open SDK for the Android wearable platform. The announcement came up this morning by Google s Sundar Pichai who is the Vice President of Android, Apps , and Google Chrome, who says that the SDK will be ready to go and will get an official Google launch in just two weeks from today. The official statement from Pichai was: -In two weeks we are launching the first developer SDK for Android, that will lay out the vision for developers in how we see this market working.-
Now that we know the SDK is coming, we have to wonder what sort of other confirmations we ll get from Pichai or anyone else at Google regarding the matter. We have already heard rumors that Google will be working LG on the Google Smartwatch, perhaps in the weeks to follow either company will confirm that this is actually the case. Even if it is true, LG may not be the only one to release a smartwatch working off of the Android Wearable OS this year. Since it will be an open SDK fairly shortly, that means that other OEMs will have the chance to work with the software packages to complete a wearable product and release it to the public. Wouldn t it be nice to see an official Google Smartwatch in partnership with LG, and then multiple other wearable products from OEMs like HTC, Motorola, and others as well? Whatever the case, we might at least get to see the rumored Smartwatch that both Google and LG are working on together at this years I/O event in San Francisco. There s only a few short months to go before many of us will be touching down at Google I/O 2014, and excitement is certainly rising to see what Google may have to offer and compete with other OEMs in the wearables space.
We re sure to see some cool things inside the official Google Smartwatch, but arguably what might be more intriguing is the fact that Google is making this SDK open and releasing it to the public for use with OEMs and Third Party Developers. One thing is for sure, it really is going to be an exciting year for the wearables industry.

Google to Offer Android for Wearables
By

Mar 9, 2014 2:37 pm  ET
Google s Android is the most popular operating system for smartphones. Now Google wants Android to power wearable devices.
Google executive Sundar Pichai told at the South by Southwest conference Sunday that the company plans to release a software development kit based on Android for makers of wearable devices, such as smartwatches.
Google plans to release  its own smartwatch , which will be manufactured by LG Electronics. But as with the Nexus line of smartphones that Google makes, the company wants to help lay out a  vision  for developers for wearable devices.
In making it easier for developers to use Android on wearable devices, Google would appear to be following a playbook similar to the one it used in mobile devices, where it makes Android available for free to phone and tablet makers. The software kit might give Google an opportunity to attract developers and grab a quick lead in a new category.

Google Chromecast Sales Now In The  Millions 
By Adnan Farooqui on 03/09/2014 12:01 PDT
Google hasn t exactly revealed sales figures of the Chromecast , but it did say soon after the launch of this HDMI dongle that they had underestimated its demand. This $35 dongle became an instant hit soon after it was launched last year, and even though its only available in the U.S. right now, there has been speculation that it is ready to go global . At SXSW today, Google s Android chief Sundar Pichai told attendees that Chromecast sales are now in the  millions,  and that they are continuing to grow very actively.
Pichai also said that in the coming weeks Chromecast is going to be released in more countries, however he didn t detail exactly which countries will be the first after the U.S. to receive this popular dongle. Previous rumors suggest that the UK might be the first international stop for Chromecast, a UK retailer had its availability listed for March 1st but that was later clarified to be provisional.
It remains to be seen how soon Google is able to launch Chromecast officially in other countries, pricing would obviously vary by region and country. The $35 dongle does a bang up job of streaming content to a TV , and now that its SDK has been opened up, developers have been creating some very interesting applications for it.

UPDATE 5-GM hires law firms it works with to probe recall response
* Lawyer leading probe investigated Lehman collapse
* Two outside law firms in probe have conducted work for GM
* Two of GM's former top attorneys worked for law firm
* House Energy and Commerce Committee to investigate recall
By Ben Klayman, Paul Lienert and Nick Brown
DETROIT, March 10 General Motors hired two law firms with ties to the automaker to look into its recall of cars blamed for 13 deaths, and a Congressional committee said it would also investigate the company's response to a defect that first came to light a decade ago.
The internal probe will be led by Jenner & Block Chairman Anton "Tony" Valukas, who investigated Lehman Brothers after the financial services firm collapsed in 2008, and alleged then that Lehman used accounting gimmicks and had been insolvent for weeks before it filed for bankruptcy.
GM has worked with Jenner & Block since 2002, and at least two of the automaker's former top attorneys, Robert Osborne and Elmer Johnson, were partners at the Chicago law firm.
GM said lawyers from King & Spalding, which represented GM during some of its bankruptcy proceedings and other litigation work since, will also work on the recall review ordered up by GM CEO Mary Barra. Co-leading the recall investigation with Valukas is GM's current general counsel, Michael Millikin.
"CONFLICT OF INTEREST"
Some legal experts said there could be a conflict of interest for law firms with working ties to GM to be involved in the investigation.
"To me, there's a conflict of interest," said Monroe Freedman, a legal ethics expert and law professor at Hofstra University School of Law. "A reasonable person might question whether the firm wants to curry favor with GM, so it can maintain a good relationship or obtain future work."
GM spokesman Selim Bingol said there is no conflict of interest, and Valukas "has been charged to go where the facts take him and give the company an unvarnished report on what happened. He is the ideal person to do that, given his understanding of our business and his reputation for adhering to the highest standards."
Jenner and King may indeed speed things along, said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law. "It makes sense as a matter of efficiency since the firms know the client," he told Reuters.
In a letter to employees last week, Barra promised an "unvarnished" look at the recall that is occurring 10 years after the issue first came to light. She has not granted any interviews on the matter.
GM is recalling cars to correct a condition that could allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle is traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected.
The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.
The House Energy and Commerce Committee said it is investigating GM and the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration's (NHTSA) response to consumer complaints related to the problems with ignition switches. ()  The committee, led by Michigan Republican Fred Upton, will hold hearings in the coming weeks. Upton led the 2000 investigation into Firestone tire failures on Ford Motor Co vehicles - resulting in the TREAD Act that requires automakers to report complaints of defects to the NHTSA.
"Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner? If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended," Upton said in a statement from the committee late Monday.
In an email, GM spokesman Greg Martin said the company was "fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the Committee, too."
CONTROLLING THE INFORMATION FLOW
GM may be focused on controlling the flow of information from the review.
"If they want to send a message to shareholders that they have uncovered everything, they might hire an independent firm," Richard Painter, a professor at University of Minnesota Law School, told Reuters. "But they may want to disclose just enough to keep shareholders informed, and keep other things private to keep legal defenses available to them."
Sources previously said GM's team of investigators had begun interviewing employees involved in the problems surrounding the ignition switch, which first came to the company's attention in 2004.
GM went through a U.S. government-led bankruptcy in 2009, which is the dividing line between what became known as "old GM" and "new GM."
Valukas served as lead counsel for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's four-year investigation of "old" GM's pension accounting, which concluded with no allegations of fraud or intentional misconduct.
Jenner & Block was the lead outside counsel for GM's initial public offering in 2010 when it returned to the market as a public company following its bankruptcy restructuring, and it has said in filings that it has worked for GM since 2002. In addition, some partners at the firm have relationships with GM that go back even farther.
A Jenner & Block spokesperson on Monday declined to comment on how much the firm bills GM annually, and on whether there was any concern within the firm of a real or perceived conflict of interest in Valukas leading GM's internal investigation of the ignition-switch recall.
King & Spalding referred questions to GM. Valukas declined to comment on his appointment by GM, which said late Monday that Jenner & Block is "doing other work for us."
WAITING FOR PARTS
The No. 1 U.S. automaker has said the recall will begin next month when it has the replacement parts. Most of the affected vehicles are in North America.
While recalls are not unusual, the number of fatalities involved and the way GM handled this one stretching over the past decade has the potential to cost the company hundreds of  millions of dollars in fines and possible legal damages, in addition to tarnishing its reputation.
U.S. safety regulators have also opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough. The NHTSA sent the automaker a list of 107 questions about the recall to answer by April 3.
In addition to ordering up an apology and crafting the letter to employees with Bingol's help, Barra has designated assignments for top executives related to the recall, according to a person familiar with the situation.
Barra placed global product development chief Mark Reuss in charge of working with supplier Delphi Automotive to obtain the replacement parts as quickly as possible and assigned North American head Alan Batey to work with GM dealers on serving the customers, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the recall.
She also involved GM quality and customer service chief Alicia Boler-Davis as well as Bingol, who is in charge of GM's governmental affairs in Washington, the person said.

Federal auto-safety regulators were under fire Monday for failing to act quickly on evidence that faulty ignition switches in some General Motors cars were killing the engine and preventing air bags from inflating in accidents, contributing to 13 deaths.
Consumer advocates   including Joan B. Claybrook, a former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration   called on NHTSA to investigate why it did not demand that GM recall affected models after learning as early as 2007 that an ignition defect could inadvertently stall a car, disabling its air bags.
 While GM bears complete responsibility for failing to recall these vehicles by 2005, when it knew what the defect was and how to fix it, NHTSA has responsibility for failing to order a recall by early 2007, when it knew what the effect was and how to fix it,  Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, wrote in a letter to NHTSA seeking an independent probe of the agency s response.
Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said late Monday that the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which he chairs, will investigate whether GM or NHTSA missed  something that could have flagged these problems sooner. If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened. 
NHTSA officials defended the agency s actions, saying they have long been concerned about the potential stalling problem. The agency launched probes of suspicious crashes caused by the faulty switches, but investigators struggled to pinpoint the exact cause of the accidents amid a fog of complaints and complications, including the introduction of a new type of air bag around the time of the earliest incidents.

Wait 1 second to continue.
 NHTSA receives and screens more than 40,000 consumer complaints each year and pursues investigations and recalls wherever our data justifies doing so,  the agency said in a statement.  As a data-driven organization,  NHTSA is constantly looking for ways to improve our process so we can better identify serious safety defects in the nation s vehicle fleet and ensure that those defects are remedied. 
GM on Monday named a former federal prosecutor to head its inquiry into why the automaker waited more than a decade to recall vehicles equipped with the problematic ignition switches, which now number more than 1.6 million.
Anton  Tony  Valukas, chairman of the law firm Jenner & Block, will work with GM s general counsel, Michael Millikin, on the probe. In addition, attorneys from the law firm King & Spalding will help conduct the investigation into the chain of events leading up to GM s announcement last month that the vehicles would be recalled.
GM chief executive Mary Barra said she has demanded an  unvarnished  picture of GM s handling of the ignition problem.
The automaker, which has been enjoying a resurgence following its descent into bankruptcy in 2009, issued the recall last month to fix the faulty switches, which sometimes cause cars to turn themselves off, stalling the engine and shutting down electronic components, including air bags. The company has said that the problem is more likely to occur when cars go off the road or when the ignition switch is jostled by, for example, the driver s knee or an overloaded key ring.
GM has linked the problem to 13 deaths, and consumer activists suspect the total could rise. The recall covers the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, and the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky and Chevrolet HHR.
As it draws pointed scrutiny for its response, NHTSA is conducting its own investigation. Last week, it issued an order to GM, demanding answers to 107 questions about what happened in the decade between the first indication that the switch was faulty and last month s recall.
In what some agency officials called an unprecedented request, NHTSA wants the names of employees involved in investigating the problem. It also wants to know details about complaints GM received from owners, the names and correspondence of employees involved in the company s attempts to fix the problem, and reasons why proposed design changes were not implemented in 2004 and 2005, soon after the problem first surfaced.
Among the first victims of the faulty switch was Amber Marie Rose, 16, a Southern Maryland girl who died in 2005. Rose was legally drunk, she was not wearing a seat belt and her Chevrolet Cobalt was going 69 mph in a 25-mph zone when the car crashed early one morning, according to an investigation of the accident.
Still, an investigator hired by Rose s adoptive parents determined that her car s ignition switch had gone into the  accessory  position during the accident, preventing her air bags from deploying. And Rose likely would have been saved by a functioning air bag, the investigator concluded, said Rose s birth mother, Laura Christian.
In 2006, the automaker disclosed the problem to dealers in a technical-service bulletin that resulted in repairs to 474 cars. In 2007, a research team looking into the Rose crash informed federal safety regulators about the potential link between the defective ignition switches and the failure of air bags to deploy.
Another seven years would pass before last month s recall.
 It is absolutely appalling,  Christian said in an interview Monday,  that it took so long for this recall to happen.

General Motors is currently dealing with a 1.6-million-vehicle recall that s been linked to a nine-year ignition switch defect, and while a high-profile case like this normally comes with an onslaught of lawsuits, GM says those filed before its 2009 bankruptcy are not its problem.
The defect that GM first learned about in 2004 has been linked to 31 crashes with 13 deaths in the U.S., but under terms of its bankruptcy, GM is not liable for injuries that arose before then. That means anyone involved in an accident in one of the recalled vehicles who filed a lawsuit before 2009 will have to negotiate with  old GM  for recoveries on their claims. However,  new GM  is assuming responsibility for legal actions brought on after 2009. While this seems rather questionable, a bankruptcy lawyer told The Wall Street Journal that  In a bankruptcy sale, generally speaking the [asset] buyer is not going to be liable for any claims the old company is liable for. 
Among the recalled vehicles include several of old GM s vehicles such as the 2005- 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 , 2003- 2007 Saturn ION , 2006- 2007 Chevrolet HHR , and 2006- 2007 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky . The vehicles were recalled because it was found that if there s too much weight on the key ring, or if the car hits a rough patch of road, the ignition could inadvertently turn off, resulting in a loss of power. If the vehicle is still in motion, this could cause a crash   and because the vehicle is off, airbags may not deploy.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating the timeliness of GM s latest ignition switch recall. Under federal regulations, an automaker must inform the NHTSA of a potential safety problem within five business days after discovering the issue, and GM has admitted it s known about the problem since 2004. However, neither GM nor the NHTSA have provided details on the timing of known injuries.

GM is internally investigating its handling of the recall of ignition switches linked to 13 deaths.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration may have known as early as 2007 about a faulty ignition problem in over 1 million General Motors cars.
That s according to a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Joan Claybrook, who has asked for an agency probe as it investigates GM. The car king may have known about the malfunction since 2004 but didn t order a recall until last month.
The recall includes various versions of the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, the Pontiac G5 and Solstice and the Saturn Ion and Sky.
All models were suspected of a potentially deadly fault in which the car s engine, electronics and air bags sometimes inadvertently switches off when the key jiggles.
Questions are now being raised over why the recall wasn t issued sooner. In 2005, the NHTSA conducted three special crash investigations into why GM s new air bags weren t deploying, so suspicions should have been spiked. There were also at least six complaints logged in the NHTSA database about the problem from as far back as 2007. That year, the NHTSA and GM met to discuss a crash involving an involuntary engine switch-off.
GM says 31 crashes and 13 deaths are connected to the malfunction, including one involving 15-year-old Amy Rademaker of Woodville, Wis.
 These were our children! And [GM] just acted like they don t matter! They may not have mattered to GM, but they mattered to us,  said Rademaker s mother, Marhie Beskau.
These were our children! And [GM] just acted like they don t matter! They may not have mattered to GM, but they mattered to us.

Mother of car crash victim
General Motors is conducting an internal investigation now. The company s new CEO, Mary Barra, announced last week that she will personally direct the recall. It s her first major test as leader of the company, which went through bankruptcy restructuring in 2009.
In a statement published Wednesday, GM said,  In addition to getting NHTSA the information they need, we are doing what we can now to ensure our customers  safety and peace of mind. We want our customers to know that today s GM is committed to fixing this problem in a manner that earns their trust. 
The NHTSA  is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Its mission includes investigating safety defects in motor vehicles.
In 2013 , the NHTSA says, automakers issued 632 recalls involving 22 million vehicles. Seven million of those vehicles were recalled because the agency initiated an investigation. More than 15 million were because the automakers reported problems.
In the case of this GM recall, the question is why the government didn t step in earlier, given that the agency first investigated the problem back in 2007.
The NHTSA probe of GM is expected to continue for six months. If it finds GM knew of the defect and did not report it within the first five days, the company could face a fine of $35 million.

General Motors Co. (NYSE:GM) executives had hoped to begin this year anew, in recovery from the company's 2009 Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it seems the past will continue to haunt the world s second-largest auto manufacturer. GM just began a recall of 1.6 million cars to replace faulty ignition switches that can cause the car to shut down in motion, leading to hazardous driving conditions that have been linked to 13 fatalities and 31 crashes in the U.S. since 2004.
The company has until April 3 to respond to more than 100 questions from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (click here to read the PDF) about the recall. The NHTSA itself is under scrutiny because it dismissed hundreds of complaints from car owners over the years about cars stalling in motion.
As more details are released about the recall, it s becoming clear GM has a corporate bureaucracy that s slow to respond to safety issues. CEO Mary Barra said recently that she was only informed of the problem on Jan. 31 after deliberations by internal committees who insulate corporate higher-ups, and Robert Lutz, who was vice chair of global product development when subordinates were studying the ignition switch issue, last week vehemently denied to the New York Times knowing anything about the issue.

The NHTSA could slap the automaker with a civil fine of up to $35 million if it finds that GM knew about a safety problem and didn t inform the federal safety watchdog within the legally required five business days. The company could also face charges from the U.S. attorney s office, which is currently going after Toyota, the world s largest automaker, for the way it disclosed sudden acceleration problems in its vehicles. But $35 million is a relative drop in the bucket compared to what it pays out in product liability claims, which amounted to $601 million in 2012, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last year.
How much GM could wind up paying out in product liability claims related to the ignition switch recall will depend on how many accidents occurred after the company was turned from General Motors Corporation (aka the  old GM ) into General Motors Company, the  new GM. 
When it comes to litigation, the new GM in not liable for any sins committed by the old company.
  The analogy is if someone committed fraud while he was alive; you can go after the assets of the estate of the deceased, if there are any assets,  said John Bird, a bankruptcy lawyer for Fox Rothschild LLP in Wilmington, Del.  The old GM is dead. This is a new GM, with new hands and new shareholders. 
Essentially the new GM is protected from legal liabilities of the old GM, which still exists as a shell company but doesn t have any assets that could pay out liability claims. That means that anyone harmed by the ignition switch flaw prior to GM s restructuring will not be able to sue the new GM. So far only two of the 13 fatalities in accidents involving cars that fall under the recall and recorded by the NHTSA occurred after GM s bankruptcy: one involving a Pennsylvania woman in January 2010 and another from a female driver in Georgia in March of the same year.
The recall includes six models: the Chevrolet Cobalt (2005-2007 model years), the Chevrolet HHR (2006-2007), the Pontiac Pursuit (2005-2006), the Pontiac Solstice (2006-2007) the 2007 Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion (2003-2007) and the 2007 Saturn Sky.

Opel February European car registrations: -2% (Seeking Alpha)
General Motors (NYSE: GM ) and the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration are under scrutiny for taking years to address an ignition switch problem that is tied to 13 deaths.
Last month, the Detroit automaker recalled 1.6 million vehicles. NHTSA has launched an investigation into how long it took GM to admit there was an issue and take action.
GM learned about at least one incident of ignition switch problems in the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt around the time of the vehicle's launch, according to a chronology report submitted to NHTSA.
The report says GM employees were able to replicate the ignition switch issue, where the key moved out of the  run  position when the driver accidentally contacted the key or steering column. An engineering inquiry was opened to investigate the issue. Although there were potential solutions, the inquiry was closed without action  after consideration of the lead time required, cost, and effectiveness of each of these solutions,  according to the report.
The Wall Street Journal says that GM's chronology of events surrounding the issue shows the company is  burdened by bureaucratic complexity  to the point that it wasn't able to decide how to address a fatal defect in its vehicles.
Related: Mary Barra Takes Charge, Launches Internal Inquiry Into GM Recall
 Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot once said that where he came from, if you see a snake, you kill it. But at General Motors, if you see a snake, you hire a consultant on snakes, then you form a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years,  the WSJ article says.
GM announced Monday it hired Jenner & Block Chairman Anton Valukas to help lead an internal investigation into how the company handled the ignition switch failures, Bloomberg reports .
NHTSA's actions are also being examined. Despite receiving more than 260 complaints over 11 years, federal safety regulators never investigated the problem, the New York Times reports. A NYT analysis of consumer complaints submitted to NHTSA found that complaints about potentially dangerous shutdowns due to faulty ignition switches were received roughly twice a month since February 2003, but the agency repeatedly responded that there wasn't enough evidence to launch an investigation into the issue. The NYT says the complaints involved six of the models currently being recalled by GM.
Senior Kelley Blue Book analyst Jack Nerad told Benzinga the fact that the complaints on the ignition issue occurred across several different brands might have masked the scope of the problem.
 NHTSA relies, in part, on reporting by vehicle manufacturers and typically engages in very frank exchanges with manufacturers in determining if there is a safety issue, how big the issue is and what can be done to rectify it,  Nerad said in an email.  To do its job effectively NHTSA needs to communicate with auto manufacturers. Both NHTSA and the individual auto manufacturers have the same goal   providing safe transportation to the buying public. At times the two sides do differ on what is required to obtain that result. 
Watchdogs and Revolving Doors
The issue could also be how GM and NHTSA work together. Automotive News suggests that the federal agency is getting too cozy with the automaker, referring to NHTSA as the  watchdog that didn't bark.  The article cites a Sherlock Holmes story where the detective observes that the watchdog didn't bark on the night of a murder, indicating the murderer must have been someone friendly with the dog.
Automotive safety expert Byron Bloch told Benzinga an ongoing problem for NHTSA is its revolving door between the government and the automotive industry.
 I think it's important to realize that NHTSA is frequently politicized to the point that decision-makers inside have come from the auto industry directly,  said Bloch.
When reports of ignition switch issues began trickling in around 2005, Jacqueline Glassman was the acting administrator of NHTSA. Glassman had previously worked as a senior counsel for Chrysler. Jeffrey Rosen was the general counsel for the U.S. Department of Transportation. Before that, he worked for Kirkland & Ellis, who has represents GM.
 If you want to put it in this framework, the top two decision makers were from Chrysler and GM, respectively,  said Bloch.  Might their decisions be gently or more overtly influenced because of these affiliations?

General Motors ( NYSE:GM ) has a lot on its plate with its recent 1.6 million vehicle recall, which was initiated in January and expanded last month, but a new report from the New York Times indicates that GM might be able to share at least a portion of the blame with federal regulators.
Reportedly, more than 260 complaints were submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over the past 11 years regarding General Motors vehicles that suddenly turned off while being driven. The recall covers several models that, if too much weight is placed on the keyring, can turn off while the car is traveling, shutting off power steering, brakes, and perhaps most importantly, the car s airbags. Some 13 fatalities have been linked directly to the problem, spread over 31 accidents.
Since 2003, the NHTSA received about two complaints per month over GM vehicles that shut down randomly, though it responded to the complaints repeatedly saying that there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant a safety investigation, the Times said.
General Motors has already started sending alerts to owners of potentially affected vehicles, but the company is now under investigation about the timeliness of its response. The issues were first discovered in 2004 on cars from the 2005 model year, though the company took no recall action until January   and neither did the NHTSA, it seems.
 When the vehicle shuts down, it gives no warning, it just does it,  the New York Times quoted one driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt as writing.  I drive my car to and from work praying that it won t shut down on me while on the freeway.  The somber tone was consistent among other complaints, as well.  Engine stops while driving   cannot steer nor brake so controlling the car to a safe stop is very dangerous,  one said.
The company s unfortunate situation is made all the more challenging for General Motors given that its new CEO, Mary Barra, only took the helm in January. The agency has a list of 107 questions that it needs answers to from the company, putting Barra and her new cabinet on the spot barely two months into her tenure.
For its part, the NHTSA says that it  has repeatedly suggested that it failed to act over the years because of a lack of a critical mass of evidence that suggested a problem beyond isolated incidents,  the Times says. The agency  uses a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall,  it said in a statement, also pointing out that the 260 complaints amounts to about .018 percent of the vehicles under recall.
Judgments are made by  really well-seasoned automotive engineers who leverage a lot of technology and lean on past precedent about when to open, when to close, and when to push for a recall,  said Frank Borris, the director of the agency s office of defects investigation, talking about using IBM software to help look for patterns.  It s no magic formula,  he added.

General Motors launches an internal investigation into how the company handled a recall linked to more than a dozen deaths.
GM recalled roughly 1.4 million cars last month because of a problem with the ignition switch that could cause cars to easily be shut off while driving.
The faulty switch is linked to 31 frontal crashes and at least 13 deaths over several years.
Documents submitted to federal safety regulators reveal some GM engineers knew of the problem 10 years ago but did not immediately treat it as a safety concern.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether GM responded quickly enough  in recalling the car.
Automakers are required to inform federal regulators of safety defects within five days of discovering them.

Did federal regulators fail to flag complaints against GM?
Email
The warnings are written in a stark plain text file maintained on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website .
"I'm just happy my family is alive," one driver wrote of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, after the car's engine suddenly went dead after driving over a small rock. "I don't think this is the first and last time this will happen, and hopefully a recall will take place before someone dies from this flaw."
Another complaint tells a harrowing story about a woman who was driving with her four-year-old son in a 2005 Cobalt when the car suddenly died on the highway. "She was able to coast off the highway, but was almost rear-ended by a larger vehicle that was following her," the complaint notes.
More than 260 complaints were made during the past 11 years about Cobalts and other General Motors cars that suddenly shut off while driving, or about two complaints per month, according to an analysis by The New York Times . With GM's recall of 1.6 million cars last month, the finger pointing has begun. While the NHTSA is investigating the "timeliness" of the recall, others are asking whether the government agency missed picking up on a trend hidden within its long ledger of complaints.
The NHTSA has been criticized before for missing patterns, with the agency coming under fire more than a decade ago for failing to flag problems with Ford Explorers with Firestone tires, The Times notes.
But the NHTSA is defending its track record when it comes to the GM cars, noting that there wasn't enough evidence to support an investigation. The 260 complaints represent only about 0.018 percent of all cars that have been recalled.
"Regarding the recent recall of certain GM vehicles, the data available to NHTSA at the time did not contain sufficient evidence of a possible safety defect trend that would warrant the agency opening a formal investigation," the agency said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.
The NHTSA said it uses "a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall." Customer complaints are only one source of information that the agency considers, as well as early warning data, crash investigations and industry-related websites, the agency said.
One thing is for certain: GM knew of the defect, which happens when a key chain is jostled and shuts off the ignition, as early as 2004 .  GM was aware of the problem with the debut of its 2005 Chevy Cobalt, but said in a chronology provided to the NHTSA that it decided to close an inquiry because of "lead time required, cost and effectiveness."
A former head of the NHTSA is asking the Department of Transportation to investigate into why the agency didn't demand a recall earlier, according to USA Today . Joan Claybrook, who is now an activist, said the agency "failed to carry out the law" by not requiring GM fix the problems earlier.
The finger-pointing probably isn't much consolation to the families and friends of those involved in the 31 crashes and 13 deaths linked to the defect. According to the complaints listed in the NHTSA's database, there may have been many more close calls.
"The car stalled once this morning and then completely shut down without warning," one woman wrote of her husband's 2005 Cobalt, which she noted had shut down while on the highway. "My husband thought he was going to die."

General Motors said on March 10 that it has appointed Anton Valukas, chairman of law firm Jenner & Block, to jointly lead an investigation into the 1.6 million vehicle recall the automaker issued last month.
Valukas, a former U.S. attorney for the district of Illinois, served as the examiner into the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and wrote a comprehensive report on the Wall Street firm s failure.
GM General Counsel Michael Millikin will coordinate the investigation with Valukas. Lawyers from King & Spalding will also participate.
The recall affects vehicles built since 2004 which are suspected of having faulty ignitions. The problem can cause car engines, as well as airbags, to be unintentionally turned off. The defect has been linked to 23 crashes and 13 deaths.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued GM with a 27-page order on March 4 that has to be completed by April 3.
In a note to employees on March 4, GM Chief Executive Mary Barra promised the company would take an  unvarnished  look at how the company handled the recall.

Owners of cars involved in General Motors  wide-ranging ignition-switch recall may be out of luck if they want to sue the automaker. The Wall Street Journal reports that bankruptcy proceedings mean GM is safe from liability lawsuits over any accidents that occurred before 2009.
When the  old GM  was dissolved in bankruptcy in 2009, its responsibility for any product-liability lawsuits vanished as the company s creditors broke up its remnants. The  new GM  established post-bankruptcy is still responsible for vehicles produced before 2009, but it cannot be held liable for accidents or injuries that occurred before then.
 It is true that new GM did not assume liability for claims arising from incidents or accidents occurring prior to July 2009,  a spokesman confirmed today in an emailed statement.  GM is focused on ensuring the safety and peace of mind of our customers involved in the recall  Our principle throughout this process has been to the put the customer first, and that will continue to guide us. 
The Journal reports that anyone pursuing litigation against  old GM    that is, suing over something that happened before 2009   must work with mediation lawyers and typically won t receive much compensation. However, the automaker that most people recognize today as General Motors will only be subject to lawsuits if somebody was injured or killed in one of the affected vehicles after July 2009.
The GM ignition switch recall was first announced in February , covering 619,122 vehicles in the U.S. The problem stems from a faulty ignition-switch design, which can allow the switch to inadvertently move from  Run  to  Off.  That can stall the car while driving, possibly precipitating an accident. Worse yet, GM found that the ignition often toggled  Off  in an accident, disabling the airbags and thus increasing the severity of the accident.
Later in February, GM expanded the recall to cover a total of 1.37 million cars in the U.S. The automaker said that had reports of 31 crashes in which the airbags didn t deploy because the ignition switch toggled off, and reports of 13 deaths due to the problem. The recall covers the 2003- 2007 Saturn ION , 2006- 2007 Chevrolet HHR , 2006- 2007 Pontiac Solstice , 2006- 2007 Saturn Sky , 2005- 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt , and 2007 Pontiac G5 .

General Motors announced this week that a team conducting a probe of the company's ignition-switch recall that's been linked to 13 deaths is being led by the same lawyer who investigated Lehman Brothers in 2008, according to Reuters.
Anton "Tony" Valukas is the chairman of the firm Jenner & Block, whose attorneys are apparently helping with investigation of February's recall of over 1.6 million vehicles.
Valukas has not commented publically regarding the news yet.
Michael Millikin is co-leading the investigation with Valukas, according to Reuters.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a letter to employees last week that GM will take an "unvarnished" look at the
The recall supposedly came approximately 10 years after issue first came to light.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent the automaker a list of 107 questions about the recall. GM has until April 3 to answer each question.
The recall was issued to correct a condition that could allow the engine and other components to turn off unintentionally. Most of the vehicles affected by the recall are in North America.
Valukas was the court-appointed examiner in the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. His probe eventually resulted a 2,200-page document released back in 2010 that is now known as the "Valukas report."
The report detailed the causes of the financial services firm's collapse, and showed how Lehman used accounting gimmicks to boost its balance sheet.
Additionally, lawyers from the firm King & Spalding are also part of the team looking into the recall, according to Reuters.

Not The First Time
This isn t NHTSA first safety failure.  The agency has come under fire before for failing to recognize a pattern of consumer complaints or failing to rectify an issue before it becomes widespread.
NHTSA failed to detect the surge of on-road rollovers in Ford Explorer vehicles with Firestone Tires [the Ford/Firestone defect].
NHTSA failed to identify sudden unintended acceleration problems in Toyota vehicles until a California highway patrol officer and his family members were killed, leading to a recall of more than 10 million vehicles.
Importance of 7th Amendment Remedies
A 2000 law   the Tread Act   was designed to help NHTSA identify defects.  It requires automakers to report to NHTSA any claims received blaming auto defects for serious injuries or death.  This law was used to punish Toyota for failing to report sudden acceleration problems across many of its vehicle lines.
But now, questions are being raised about NHTSA s own timeliness.
The ability to spot trends is a huge issue, and NHTSA has not got it under control by any means.
  Joan Claybrook, former NHTSA Administrator via NTY
When the federal safety regulators are either unwilling or unable to do their job, it is the 7th Amendment right to trial by jury that holds companies accountable.
GM knew about the defect.  NHTSA knew about the defect.  Neither took action to correct the problem for nearly a decade.  It wasn t until GM was forced to face litigation under the 7th Amendment that it was finally held accountable and compelled to recall these defective vehicles.
Civil litigation is a window into what companies are really up to   the longstanding knowledge of problems they would rather ignore, and the reluctance to fess up and correct them.  In this case  GM s internal records show that the decision to take the Cobalt to market, despite the ignition switch problem, was just a cost thing   and it cost at least six people their lives.
 The chief engineer who discovered the problem, he just whitewashed it.  We can t fit it in time, so  it will have to remain in the car when we begin selling them later this year,  [attorney Lance] Cooper says.   It s bone-chilling.  They recognized the defect.  If they just would have fixed it, I have no doubt that Brooke Melton would be alive today. 
 I m a conservative trial lawyer and I am conservative in my beliefs that the federal government often doesn t do a good job, and you need the private market   in the case, the jury system that allows individuals to investigate and hold GM accountable. 
  Why Civil Litigation Matters to Safety: GM Edition [Safety Research & Strategies]
NHTSA Finally Acts
NHTSA   finally   has begun acting on the GM ignition problem  but only after civil litigation exposed the problems and private sector investigators publicized the issue.
Last week, NHTSA issued a remarkable 27-page special order requiring GM to answer 107 questions about the ignition defect.  Let s hope NHTSA remains committed to getting answers about this problem.

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) engaged the services of Anton Valukas, chairman of the law firm Jenner & Block LLP, to lead its internal investigation regarding the ignition-switch failure connected to at least 13 deaths, which led to the recall of 1.6 million vehicles, according to report from Bloomberg . Valukas served as investigator of the collapse of the Lehman Brothers Holdings.
According to the automaker, Valukas together with Michael Millikin, general counsel of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), will handle the investigation. Lawyers from King & Spalding are also part of the investigating team.
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) is conducting an internal investigation in response to the 27-page order from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to outline the steps the automaker is carrying out to resolve engineering concerns and consumer complaints on the issue dating back in 2004. The automaker has until April 3 to answer specific questions in the order that was issued on March 4.
General Motors potential fine
According to Bloomberg, the NHTSA could impose as much as a $35 million penalty against General Motors if it finds out that the automaker didn t implement a recall when it was aware that the cars were defective. The NHTSA could also file criminal charges against the automaker.
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) recently stated that heavy key rings or jarring could cause ignition switches to slip out of position, cutting off power, and deactivating air bags on some Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn vehicles. The automaker found that the defect was connected to at least 23 crashes, including crashes that resulted in 13 deaths.
Much work ahead
Mary Barra, chief executive officer of General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), emphasized in her note to employees last week that the automaker  acted without hesitation  to deal with the recall over the past few weeks, but that they have much work ahead.
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) already recalled 778,562 Cobalts and G5s, as well as an additional 800,000 Saturn Ions (2003 to 2007 models), Chevrolet HHRs (2006 to 2007 models), Pontiac Solstices (2006 to 2007 models) and Saturn Skys (2006 to 2007 models). The automaker also said that the 2005 to 2006 Pontiac Pursuit and 2007 Opel GT sold in Canada and Europe respectively were included in the recall.
In a separate report, Greg Martin, spokesperson for General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) denied reports that the automaker ignored customer complaints. According to him, the company was monitoring complaints, but he did not provide further details regarding the investigation into failures related to the ignition switches.

General Motors Company (GM) hires Anton Valukas to lead internal recall probe
General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) has hired Anton Valukas to oversee an internal probe of an ignition-switch failure that resulted in 13 deaths. Valukas is chairman of Jenner & Block LLP, who served as a U.S. Justice Department examiner that dealt with the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings. GM is recalling 1.6 million vehicles and the investigation is being conducted by Valukas and GM General Counsel Michael Millikin. GM is also working with law firm King & Spalding.
The internal investigation is taking place at the same time that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is probing GM to find out what steps the auto company took to investigate engineering concerns and consumer complaints that dated back to 2004. GM was given until April 3rd to answer specific questions in a 27-page order that was issued on March 4th.
Last month, General Motors said that heavy key rings or jarring could have caused ignition switches in Chevrolet, Saturn, and Pontiac vehicles to slip out, which cut off power and deactivated air bags in the vehicles. General Motors connected this defect to 23 crashes and 13 deaths.
The NHTSA could fine GM as high as $35 million if it found that the auto company did not pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective. The NHTSA may also seek criminal charges. If the fine hits $35 million, it would be the highest ever in the U.S.
GM s newly appointed CEO Mary Barra said she is going to lead monitoring progress on the recall with other senior executives. The recalls affect Chevrolet Cobalts, Pontiac G5s, Saturn Ions, Chevrolet HHRs, Pontiac Solstices, Pontiac Pursuits, Saturn Skys, and Opel GTs.

GM recall probe team includes inside, outside attorneys
FULL COVERAGE:
INDIA ELECTIONS 2017
DETROIT, March 10 General Motors Co said on Monday that the team conducting a probe of the company's handling of an ignition switch recall linked to 13 deaths includes attorneys from both inside and outside the No. 1 U.S. automaker.
The team conducting a review of last month's recall of more than 1.6 million vehicles is being led by Tony Valukas, chairman of the law firm Jenner & Block, and by GM's general counsel, Michael Millikin, the company said.
In addition, lawyers from the firm King & Spalding are also part of the team, GM said.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra previously said in a letter to employees that the company would take an "unvarnished" look at the company's handling of the recall, which occurred about 10 years after the issue came to light.
GM's recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off.
GM previously said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.
The company said last week that the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.

  The GM Recall
UPDATED: 3/11/14 11:40 am ET
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee said late Monday it has launched an investigation into General Motors' recall of  ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths.
As part of the probe, an Energy and Commerce subcommittee will hold hearings that are expected to include officials from GM and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, although a date has not been set for the hearing, Charlotte Baker, a committee spokeswoman, told The New York Times.
"Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner? If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended," U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the committee, said in a statement Monday .
In the Senate, Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, has asked for a subcommittee hearing on the matter from Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said a person familiar with the matter who didn t want to be identified because the request isn t public. The Detroit News reported the request earlier.
GM said earlier Monday it has hired Jenner & Block Chairman Anton Valukas, who served as a U.S. Justice Department-appointed examiner of the downfall of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., to help lead an internal probe of the handling of the ignition-switch recall.
NHTSA officials have also expanded a probe of the recall.
Upton oversaw a subcommittee in 2000 that investigated the rollovers of Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires, a problem that followed years of complaints and was eventually linked to 271 deaths.
In response, Congress passed the Tread Act, sponsored by Upton, that requires automakers to report complaints of defects in a timely matter to NHTSA and make it easier to identify and track automotive safety defects.
Upton, in calling for hearings, said he is particularly interested in how an automaker and U.S. safety regulators, despite the added oversight, once again failed to recognize safety defects and trends.
 Here we are over a decade later, faced with accidents and tragedies, and significant questions need to be answered,  Upton said in a statement.  Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner? Americans deserve to have the peace of mind that they are safe behind the wheel."
GM said it is already cooperating with NHTSA and planned to cooperate with the House committee's investigation, as well. 
"We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts," GM said in a statement late Monday.

GM's internal investigation of the flaw that prompted the recall of 1.6 million vehicles is being conducted jointly by a team led by Valukas and GM s general counsel, Michael Millikin, the automaker said in a statement. Attorneys from the law firm King & Spalding are also part of the team conducting the investigation, GM said.

The internal company probe is running parallel to a query from NHTSA on what steps the company took to investigate engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating from 2004.
GM has until April 3 to answer specific questions in a 27-page order the safety agency issued March 4.
GM last month said heavy key rings or jarring can cause ignition switches on some Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn vehicles to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. GM has now linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including the 13 deaths.
The auto-safety regulator could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the U.S., if it finds the automaker didn t pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective. The agency can also seek criminal charges.
Reputation at stake
GM CEO Mary Barra said March 4 she would lead senior executives monitoring progress on the recall, which includes Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 small cars. The company s reputation may be driven by how it responds, she said.
GM  has acted without hesitation  to address the recall in the past few weeks, Barra said in a note on a Web site last week for employees.  We have much more work ahead of us. 
The initial recall on Feb. 13, limited to 778,562 Cobalts and G5s, was widened less than two weeks later to include more than 800,000 additional vehicles. Those vehicles include 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and the 2006-2007 Saturn Sky. Other models affected are the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada and the 2007 Opel GT sold in Europe.
GM North America President Alan Batey said in a Feb. 25 statement expanding the recall to the Saturn Ions and other models that the company s  process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.  The automaker is preparing a second timeline related to the Feb. 25 recall expansion.

NHTSA Announces New Initiatives to Raise Recall Awareness
Share Article
Information on the new NHTSA-mandated labels for recall correspondence, as provided by Dallas car accident attorney Jeff Rasansky.
NHTSA Recall label
Let's hope that this new plan keeps us consumers aware of important vehicle safety recalls.
Dallas, TX (PRWEB) March 10, 2014
Vehicle defects account for a number of serious, and sometimes fatal accidents on American roads. Many of these accidents may have been prevented if car manufacturers acted in a timely manner in recalling defective vehicles.
New Measures Announced
Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced new measures to ensure that customers who may have bought defective vehicles see notices alerting them of recalls. This new move is aimed at getting recalled cars off the road as soon as possible by ensuring that car owners don t ignore these important notices.
Consumer Awareness is Vital
The U.S Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said that recalls only work if consumers are aware of them. In reality, most consumers disregard current recall correspondence, thinking that it s just more spam. This new label on recall correspondence will ensure that car owners act in a timely manner to have their brakes, tires and other components fixed.
The NHTSA will work closely with state and federal authorities to ensure that this new order is reinforced, and that other marketing campaigns looking to confuse consumers do not distract them from these important notices.
Car accidents have numerous causes. However, a tiny manufacturing defect can lead to a serious auto accident. Even though car manufacturers have to follow stringent rules during assembly, a computer or human error may let a defect pass through unnoticed until a later date. These defects may cause brakes to malfunction, pedals to stick, trip computers to go haywire, and can even even make it impossible for airbags to deploy.
In addition to manufacturing defects, many automobiles have been recalled due to what are called design defects. A design defect is not a manufacturing mistake, rather, its an inherent design flaw which puts consumers at unreasonable risk.
"Kudos to the NHTSA for taking action on this important issue," said attorney Jeff Rasansky. "Let's hope that this new plan keeps us consumers aware of important vehicle safety recalls."

TNM
Safety activist Joan Claybrook - a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - has sought an investigation into why the NHTSA failed to demand a recall of General Motors' (GM) vehicles affected by a potentially fatal problem involving ignition switches.
Pointing out the NHTSA became aware of the problem with GM ignition switches way back in 2007, Claybrook said that the agency's inactivity on the recall of the affected vehicles shows that it had "failed to carry out the law." Claybrook is of the opinion that the NHTSA should have forced GM to fix the problem back then, in 2007.
Claybrook's call for a probe into the NHTSA's evident lapse comes within weeks of the GM's recall of 1.37 million cars in the US in February. Revealing that the recall is related to faulty ignition switches which can shut off power to the front airbags, GM said that it has received reports of 31 crashes and 13 deaths linked to the ignition-switch problem.
The vehicles which have been recalled by GM include the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky.
Claybrook has asked the Department of Transportation - of which the NHTSA is a unit - to investigate "the failure of" NHTSA "to require the recall" earlier, even despite initiating three Special Crash Investigations into the GM ignition-switch issue.

NEW YORK  
Less than a month after General Motors said it would recall 1.6 million cars because of a defective ignition switch, the automaker faces an arduous task: fixing the cars.
The process, particularly for older vehicles like the ones GM is recalling, is time-consuming and requires many steps, from designing the new parts, testing them to make sure they solve the problem, finding and informing owners, and completing the repairs. It will not be until early April, GM said, that the repairs will begin.

On Friday, GM started sending out the first recall letters to registered owners, telling them a fix is coming.
Under the heading  Important Safety Recall,  the letter contains a stern, if unusual, warning:  Remove all items from your key ring, leaving only the vehicle key. 
Get Talking Points in your inbox:

Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here
That s because if the defective ignition switch is jostled or even if the key chain is too heavy, it can turn off the engine and the car s electrical system, disabling the air bags.
GM said it had linked the defect to 31 crashes and 13 deaths since it was first alerted to the problem in 2004.
The letter, which does not advise drivers to stop using the car, also tells owners the replacement parts  are not currently available.

For the older cars being recalled by GM, simply getting the part made is a challenge for the automaker.
The recall covers six models: 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices; and the 2007 Saturn Sky.
Alan Adler, a GM spokesman, said that the supplier, Delphi, needed to prepare the machines that would make the part before it could be mass-produced.
Once the part is made, a second letter will be sent to registered owners telling them to schedule an appointment at a dealership. That letter, GM said, will go out later this month. The parts are not expected to arrive at dealerships any sooner than early April.
The recall of the 1.6 million vehicles, including nearly 1.4 million in the United States, is large, but it is one of many. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that over the past seven years, its investigations have resulted in more than 900 recalls, covering more than 50 million vehicles.
For models like the Cobalt, GM will use an automotive consulting firm, R.L. Polk, which performs computer searches of state motor vehicle registrations to find current owners through vehicle identification numbers. But they are harder to find.
 These are second- and third-owner cars now, because of their age,  Adler said.  And some of those who are reached may not respond, he predicted.
Adler said that General Motors would soon establish a website where owners could get more information, and that it has monitored Facebook discussions of the Cobalt as well.

By Joe Duarte     Mar 9, 2014            in Technology
Detroit -  General Motors is recalling some 1.6 million vehicles over a problem that may have lead to 13 deaths, but now comes word that U.S. regulators may have been aware of problems with the compact cars early on and did nothing.
The recall is meant to address an ignition fault that could result in the key s slipping out of the  run  position, shutting down vehicle electronics necessary for vehicle operation if the car is moving. It primarily affects Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac Pursuit/G5 compact cars built between 2003 and 2007, but also includes some other models built in that time span   Saturn Ion compact coupe and sedans, Chevrolet HHR compact hatchbacks, and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky roadsters.
There have been 31 reported incidents of the occurrence while the cars were being driven, 13 of which resulted in fatalities because when the electronics go down, the power steering won t work (meaning some loss of directional control), braking assist won t work (meaning drivers will find it more difficult to bring the car to a stop) and airbags won t deploy.
The Associated Press is reporting that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is demanding that GM turn over documents and other data to ascertain how long ago the automaker knew of the problem.
A Los Angeles Times story states that GM was aware of the problem with the ignition as early as 2004 and issued a service bulletin to its dealers in 2005, suggesting they instruct car owners to remove all key chains and other items on them, that could add weight to the key in the ignition.
A New York Times story suggests that extensive levels of company management probably prevented the issue from coming to the awareness of top level executives at the time, delaying the execution of safety action that could have prevented the catastrophic events.
However, in a counterspin, another NY Times story states that NHTSA reportedly received an average of two complaints a month about the potentially dangerous shutdowns since February 2003, but repeatedly responded that it didn t have enough evidence to order a safety investigation.
That story also states that, as required by a 2000 U.S. law arising out of the Ford Explorer/Firestone tire rollover incidents, GM had reported 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries involving the cars now named in the recall, though it is uncertain how many of those are linked to the ignition flaw.
GM has issued a public apology about its delayed response to the problem, is attempting to fix affected cars as quickly as possible, and continues to advise drivers to remove all items from the ignition key in order to lessen the impact the added weight might have on the ignition switch.

GM must address recall soon
American auto maker must tackle its recall soon to avoid damage to brand.
10 March 2014
General Motors needs to get through its ignition-switch recall and the resulting federal investigation quickly to avoid any lasting damage to its brand, but the federal probe could keep the problem in the public eye for at least six months.
Analysts and academics warn that a misstep by GM could leave it with a lingering headache, something Toyota Motor Corp experienced from 2009 to 2011 with recalls linked to sudden acceleration. The Japanese automaker was criticized for being slow to react to complaints and initially blaming the drivers.
GM is currently interviewing employees dating back to the discovery in 2004 of the problem with the ignition switch, which has since been linked to 13 deaths, sources previously said. Meanwhile, US safety regulators have opened an investigation into whether the No. 1 US automaker reacted swiftly enough in its recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles .
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Tuesday in a letter to GM employees said she deeply regretted the circumstances but was pleased with the company's response and the focus will be on customer safety and satisfaction.
Moving past the recall and related fallout will be critical to ensure the Detroit company continues the rebound since its 2009 bankruptcy reorganization, analysts said.
"They need to get past this as quickly as possible," said George Cook, a marketing professor at the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester .
"You cannot be reactive in dealing with the American car-buying public," added Cook, formerly an executive at Ford Motor Company for 10 years. "You have to be proactive and I think they'll be forgiving if it's not really, really serious. People have short memories about that stuff."
GM's recall was to correct a condition that may allow the engine and other components, including front airbags, to be unintentionally turned off.
GM has said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components. GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.
The company said last week that the initial replacement parts will be available in early April.
Trent Ross , senior vice president of reputation and risk management at Ipsos Public Affairs, said GM needs to take ownership of the issue right away. Several analysts lauded Barra for her letter.
"GM needs to show it's doing the right thing," he said. "And Mary Barra has to demonstrate that the buck stops with the CEO."
In her letter to employees, Barra emphasized that whether the company's reputation and sales suffer is not the issue.
"Our company's reputation won't be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward," she said.
GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in addition to recall costs it has not outlined. Analysts agreed the big costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.
Toyota, for instance, settled economic-loss claims in its case for more than $1 billion and is negotiating settlement of hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits. It also is in talks to settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department for a reported $1 billion.
However, that has not hurt sales or stopped Toyota from ranking highly in consumer quality rankings conducted by J.D. Power and Associates, suggesting that any damage to GM could be fleeting, analysts said.
GM's case could take time, however, given the Detroit company's internal probe and the investigation opened by the NHTSA, which Cook said could last at least six months.
Allan Kam , a former enforcement attorney with NHTSA, said the agency's 107-question "special order" was unusual. "I've never seen one quite as detailed as this one," he said.
Kam speculated GM would prefer to settle the NHTSA probe in a way that would allow its answers not to be published widely. However, the mounting pressure on NHTSA, with members of Congress sending letters of inquiry, may make that outcome unlikely.

A New York Times investigation says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration received more than 260 complaints over 11 years of GM vehicles that suddenly turned off while being driven, but did not investigate the problem.
More than 1.4 million GM cars will soon be under recall over a problem with the ignition switch that causes the vehicle to shut off in certain conditions and also disables the airbags; 13 fatal crashes have been linked to the problem by GM themselves.

The Times story also says that since 2003 GM has reported at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries involving their six recalled cars, though it isn't clear how many of those deaths are linked to the ignition switch problem.

The Times combed through 8,000 complaints about the recalled models in NHTSA's public database and found more than 260 related to a moving car stalling unexpectedly.
It's not clear from their story, however, how many of those stalls are related to the ignition problem.
The complaints cited include "frightening scenes in which moving cars suddenly stalled at high speeds, on highways, in the middle of city traffic, and while crossing railroad tracks." The most recent complaint was filed Thursday.
Sponsored
"When the vehicle shuts down, it gives no warning, it just does it," wrote one driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. "I drive my car to and from work praying that it won't shut down on me while on the freeway."
Another driver wrote of the same model: "Engine stops while driving   cannot steer nor brake so controlling the car to a safe stop is very dangerous."
The agency responded with formulaic letters to people who filed the complaints, the Times reports. The newspaper spoke to one owner who said she never got a response after complaining her daughter's 2005 Cobalt shut down three times in normal driving.
NHTSA responded to the newspaper by saying they have recalled more than 55 million cars in the last seven years, and that while they use a variety of methods to search through complaints, "260 complaints amounts to about .018 percent of the vehicles under recall." But Carter-era agency director Joan Claybrook criticized NHTSA in the Times story, saying they do not have trend-spotting methods under control.
In doing our own coverage of the GM recalls, I've been genuinely surprised at the number of Jalopnik commenters who have chimed in to say they owned the cars covered under this recall and experienced shutdowns themselves. It seems pretty clear by now that this is a real problem, and now NHTSA may not escape criticism of it either.

The One Good Thing About General Motors' Massive Recall
Before you go, we thought you'd like these...
John Rosevear, The Motley Fool, AOL.com
Mar 9th 2014 12:31PM
General Motors CEO Mary Barra, shown here with former CEO Dan Akerson, says that GM will take an "unvarnished" look at the events that led to the recent recall of 1.6 million vehicles. Photo credit: General Motors.
Last month, General Motors  announced the recall of 1.6 million vehicles built between 2003 and 2007, for faulty ignition switches.
We at The Motley Fool often say that most auto recalls are no big deal in the grand scheme of things, and that's true. Nowadays, most recalls in the auto business involve a problem that could cause a safety issue. Typically, it's a defective part that is caught quickly -- often in the automaker's own internal testing -- and the comany is proactive in making sure it's repaired promptly. It's a nuisance for owners of the affected cars, and an expense and a hassle for the automaker, but rarely much more than that.
This is not one of those recalls.
The problem with these ignition switches is this: The impact of just the right kind of crash can make the switches switch from the "run" position to the "accessory" position. If the ignition switch isn't in the "run" position during a crash, the airbags won't go off. 
What are the odds of that happening? They're not zero: apparently, there have been 31 crashes in which this happened. Thirteen people have died.
That's bad. But it gets worse. GM has known about this problem for years. It fixed the switches in 2007. But the company didn't do a recall at the time.
Why? Good question. GM's legal department is now conducting an investigation to find out.
Of course, GM was in turmoil in 2007, and for several years after, as it spiraled into a wrenching bankruptcy. It's a different company now, under very different management. As Fool contributor John Rosevear explains in this video, the one good thing in this situation is that GM's new leadership is determined to find out what happened, to take responsibility for fixing it, and to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Hey Fools, it's John Rosevear. So you may have heard that General Motors has this enormous recall going on. The story in a nutshell is that they recalled 1.6 million older vehicles, these are all 2007 model year or older, Chevy Cobalts, Pontiac G5s, Chevy HHRs, Pontiac Solstices, and Saturn Skys, they've been recalled [for] faulty ignition switches.
The issue is that the switches can fail in a way that you'd never notice until you were in a huge crash and the car's airbags failed to deploy, basically, the switch's mechanism can become loose enough that it gets knocked into an "off" position, technically the "accessory" position, by the force of the crash, and of course airbags don't deploy when the car isn't switched on. There have apparently been 31 crashes where this actually happened, where investigators determined that the airbags in one of these affected GM vehicles should have inflated and they didn't, and 13 people have died.
As safety defects go in modern cars, this one's a doozy.
We often say that most recalls are no big deal, and that modern cars are very very safe, and that's true, but this one is a big deal. It's a big embarrassment for GM, a big potential liability, but it's interesting how GM has chosen to handle this.
GM is of course a very different company now than it was back in 2007; it has been through bankruptcy, and it's under completely different senior management that has taken a completely different approach, and I would argue a much much healthier approach. What's different, first of all, is that GM has made public a chronology that shows that the company first learned of the potential for a problem way back in 2004, they outlined the whole investigative process, and it shows that they probably should have done this recall in 2007 when they figured out what the issue was and implemented a change to the ignition switch design that solved the problem.
Just owning up to that is likely to land them in some legal hot water. I mean, it seems awfully likely that they'll get sued by some of the victims here, but in addition, it's a big violation of federal regulations. Automakers are required to tell the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration within five days if they become aware of a safety defect. The maximum penalty is a $35 million dollar fine.
It looks like what happened is that some balls got dropped within GM, which is somewhat understandable given all the massive internal turmoil that GM went through between 2007 and 2011 or so, but even though it's arguably understandable it's still bad. It really looks like GM as an institution kind of dragged its feet while people were getting killed and injured in defective cars.
But what's good about this, to the extent that there's anything good here, what's good is that GM's current leadership is finally stepping up and owning this. They did release the chronology, and GM North America chief Alan Batey actually apologized, he had a letter published in USA Today that apologizes for the defect and GM's slow response to it. Batey's letter says: "Today's General Motors places our customers' satisfaction and safety at the center of all we do. That is why we are deeply sorry for the events that led to our recent recall."
And he goes on to really take a shot at Old GM. He says, "It is fair that we are getting questions about our commitment to customers when you consider the way we did business and some of the vehicles we built at times during the past decade." Reuters reported on Wednesday that a team of GM attorneys is now conducting an internal investigation, questioning employees, a day after GM CEO Mary Barra sent a letter to employees saying that GM would take an "unvarnished" look at what happened.
I have to say, as a GM shareholder, I hate that this safety defect exists, I hate that it took them so long to deal with it, but I do like the way that GM is finally stepping up here. It's nice to see management trying hard to do the right thing. Thanks for watching, and Fool on.

Auto regulators dismissed defect tied to 13 deaths
By New York Times
March 9, 2014
[ AD HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS STORY ]
Federal safety regulators received more than 260 complaints over the past 11 years about General Motors vehicles that suddenly turned off while being driven, but they declined to investigate the problem, which GM now says is linked to 13 deaths and       requires the recall of more than 1.6 million cars worldwide.
A  analysis of consumer complaints submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that       since February 2003 it received an average of two complaints a month about potentially dangerous shutdowns, but it repeatedly       responded that there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant a safety investigation. The complaints   the most recent       of which was filed Thursday   involved six GM models that the automaker is now recalling because of defective ignition switches       that can shut off engines and power systems and disable air bags. GM said the first recall notices were mailed Friday to the       owners of the vehicles.
Many of the complaints detailed frightening scenes in which moving cars suddenly stalled at high speeds, on highways, in the       middle of city traffic, and while crossing railroad tracks. A number of the complaints warned of catastrophic consequences       if something was not done.
"When the vehicle shuts down, it gives no warning, it just does it," wrote one driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. "I drive       my car to and from work praying that it won t shut down on me while on the freeway."
Another driver wrote of the same model: "Engine stops while driving   cannot steer nor brake so controlling the car to a safe       stop is very dangerous."
To the mounting complaints, the safety agency sometimes responded with polite but formulaic letters similar to one it sent       in December 2010 to Barney Frank, then a congressman from Massachusetts, who had written on behalf of a distraught constituent       whose 2006 Cobalt kept stalling. In the letter to Frank, the agency said it had reviewed its database of complaints to determine       if a "safety defect trend" existed. "At this time, there is insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation," the letter concluded.
Failure to recognize a pattern in individual complaints has been a problem for the safety agency before. In the late 1990s,       it was criticized for failing to detect a wave of highway rollovers in Ford Explorers with Firestone tires, a problem that       was eventually linked to 271 deaths.
In response, Congress passed a law in 2000 requiring automakers to report to the safety agency any claims they received blaming       defects for serious injuries or deaths, so the government would not have to rely only on consumer reports. Since 2003, GM       has reported at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries involving the now-recalled cars, according to a review of agency records.       Though the records mention potentially defective components, how many of these records were related to the ignition problem       is unclear. Even with that additional information, regulators appear to have overlooked disturbing complaints of engine shutdowns.
"We need to make it clear to both industry members and regulators that adverse events must be immediately reported and analyzed       to ensure public safety," said Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, a Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The       panel s staff is scheduled to meet with the safety agency Monday.
The safety agency has repeatedly suggested that it failed to act over the years because of a lack of a critical mass of evidence       that suggested a problem beyond isolated incidents.
In a statement emailed to The , a spokesman noted that over the past seven years, the agency s investigations       in other cases have resulted in 929 recalls of more than 55 million vehicles. The agency "uses a number of tools and techniques       to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall," the statement said. The agency said 260 complaints amounts to about .018 percent of the vehicles under recall.
In a telephone interview, Frank Borris, the director of the agency s office of defects investigation, said that two years       ago, the agency began using IBM software to help look for patterns. Judgments are made by "really well-seasoned automotive       engineers who leverage a lot of technology and lean on past precedent about when to open, when to close, and when to push       for a recall," Borris said. "It s no magic formula."
The agency s chief counsel, Kevin Vincent, said that to warrant an investigation, the case must pass a legal test of "unreasonable       risk to safety."
"That term  reasonable  is a legal term, which is very elastic and means a lot of different things in a lot of different contexts," he said. "Each case is a different fact pattern."
The recall has thrown GM into turmoil just as it was emerging from the shadow of bankruptcy under the leadership of a new       chief executive, Mary T. Barra, and as the safety agency stepped up pressure on the company in late February by launching       an investigation into the "timeliness" of GM s "defect determination." Last week the agency sent the company 107 questions,       demanding it explain why it had waited so long to recall the vehicles.
But The  review of thousands of complaints stored in the agency s public database raises questions about the       agency s own timeliness. The newspaper analyzed nearly 8,000 complaints about the recalled models to find instances when drivers       may have been affected by faulty ignition. The 260-plus total includes only complaints that mentioned a moving car stalling       unexpectedly. It does not include the complaints filed about basic ignition problems on these models, like trouble starting       or stopping a car s engine, or failures of the power steering mechanism, even though these could have stemmed from an inadvertent       ignition shutdown. People may have filed multiple complaints about the same car.
Greg Martin, a GM spokesman, said the company monitors complaints to the NHTSA about its vehicles but declined to say how       the agency responded to ignition switch complaints.
By the time the agency wrote to Frank in 2010, it had received more than 170 complaints about unexpected stopping or stalling       of the recalled GM models, and 35 specifically for the 2006 Cobalt. The Cobalt has been a particularly problematic model for       GM. In 2010, the automaker recalled some of the vehicles for power steering failure, and in December 2005, it told dealers       that owners should remove unessential items from key chains.
The expectation of the 2000 law, known as the Tread Act, was that the measure would help government regulators flag trends       months or years earlier than they would if they relied on consumer complaints alone. The law was used to punish Toyota for       failing to report unintended accelerations; that company paid a civil penalty of $16.4 million under the act. But it does       not appear to have helped the government identify problems faster.
Joan Claybrook, who led the safety agency during the Carter administration, said, "The ability to spot trends is a huge issue,       and NHTSA has not got it under control by any means."
The safety agency did hire contractors to look into two fatal crashes that killed three teenagers and have since been linked       to the ignition problems, after local accident investigators recommended inquiries. Both involved 2005 Chevrolet Cobalts,       and in both cases, the contractors found that air bags had not deployed and the cars  power had shifted into "accessory" mode   essentially the state a parked car is in when occupants want to listen to the radio. In an April 2007 report of the second       crash, the contractors cited six complaints in the agency s database that appeared to match that situation.
Many consumers who approached the agency were met with institutional silence.
"This is a safety issue if there ever was one," wrote Laura Denti of Toms River, N.J., in a letter both to GM customer service       and to the safety agency on June 29, 2005, citing three times when her daughter s new 2005 Cobalt shut down abruptly while       in operation. The letter also referred to a previous letter she had sent.
"I don t recall them ever responding," Denti said in an interview last week.
Denti s daughter Samantha, now 28, described in a separate interview her excitement when her mother leased the car for her.
"It was a beautiful car. It was red. It was great," she said.
But a few months after she got it, she said, the car suddenly died at a busy intersection.
"People were swerving and honking. They didn t expect the car to be there," she said.
Shortly after, on a trip to Tennessee, the car stalled on a highway exit ramp.
Both times, mother and daughter conveyed their alarm to the dealer, demanding an explanation and remedy. Both times, the dealer       recommended removing extra keys from the key chain, saying they could jostle the ignition switch into shutting off. After       a third stall-out, the Dentis terminated the lease.
"I ended up owing thousands of dollars extra," Samantha Denti said. "My mom said,  We ll pay. This car is a death trap. We       want out of it. "
The recall covers six models from years between 2003 and 2007: 2005 -07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn       Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices and the 2007 Saturn Sky. Both the agency and the company are warning       motorists that if they must drive a recalled vehicle, no keys other than the car key should be on the key chain to eliminate       potential jostling that could shut down the ignition.
In announcing the recalls, GM said the ignition defect may have been responsible for 31 accidents and 13 deaths, but it has       declined to disclose the names of those who died or the dates, location or other details of the crashes. The company said       it had been "involved in claims and lawsuits" related to the ignition problem, but did not disclose how many settlements had       been reached.
"Is my daughter s name in the 13?" asked Mary Ruddy of Scranton, Pa., in an interview.
The safety agency s database contains at least four complaints from Ruddy, whose 21-year-old daughter Kelly was killed Jan.       10, 2010, while driving a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. Ruddy s complaints were not counted in the review because they did not specify       stalling on the road.
In her filings to the agency, the most recent on Feb. 18, Ruddy said her daughter s car overturned and rolled, ejecting her       onto the highway.
"I knew the minute I got the news that my daughter was killed so violently and that it did not involve another car that it       had to be a mechanical failure," she wrote.
In April 2010, she received a recall notice citing failures in the power steering systems of the  05 Cobalt, and she contacted       GM, which, she said, sent three representatives   an automotive engineer, a man who identified himself as an "accident reconstructionist" and a photographer   to examine the wrecked vehicle and remove its "black box" for data.
Ruddy said that despite repeated requests, the company had declined to return the black box or share the data, and sent only       an "air bag deployment report" that she said was incomprehensible to her and her lawyer.
GM said its policy is to return any part, like a black box, to the owner of the vehicle if requested.
She said she had received form letters from the agency saying only that it had received her complaint. "They never called       me and never spoke to me."
"I just want someone to hear me," she said. "We ve had no closure. We still have no answers."

Auto regulators dismiss GM ignition defect tied to 13 deaths

ASSOCIATED PRESS
In this Thursday, Aug. 21, 2008, file photo, the Chevy Cobalt moves on the assembly line at the Lordstown Assembly Plant Thursday Aug. 21, 2008. in Lordstown, Ohio.  The U.S. government's auto safety watchdog likely is looking into whether General Motors was slow to report problems that led to a massive small-car recall and 13 deaths.
[ AD HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS STORY ]

The United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has asked General Motors to provide details about what it knew and when surrounding ignition switch failures linked to 13 deaths. The failures have resulted in a recall of 1.6 million Chevrolet, Pontiac, and Saturn vehicles.
In a 27-page order, NHTSA has requested that GM provide it with specifics on the steps it took to investigate engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating from 2004. The agency has requested the report by April 3rd.
In February , General Motors said that heavy key rings or jarring could cause ignition switches on affected cars to move out of position, thereby cutting power and deactivating air bags. The agency also stated on its website that  Falsifying or withholding information in response to this special order may also lead to criminal penalties of a fine or imprisonment of up to 15 years, or both. 
The General has stated that it is fully cooperating with the probe, welcoming  the opportunity to help the agency have a full understanding of the facts,  said  Alan Adler, a GM spokesman, in an e-mailed statement.
 In addition to getting NHTSA the information they need, we are doing what we can now to ensure our customers  safety and peace of mind,  Adler added.  We want our customers to know that today s GM is committed to fixing this problem in a manner that earns their trust. 
General Motors CEO Mary Barra stated that she would guide senior executives in monitoring progress on the recall, adding that the automaker s reputation may be driven by how it responds.
GM  has acted without hesitation  to address the recall in the past few weeks, reads Barra s note from a GM employee website.  We have much more work ahead of us. 
NTHSA s order contains 107 questions about the events leading up to the recall, including the 10-year timeline the automaker provided regulators on February 24th. The agency also requested all GM documents used to prepare the timeline, as well as details about each of the 23 crashes the automaker linked to the defect, and all depositions and testimony from lawsuits.
The agency also requested details surrounding the following items:
Names and correspondence from any employee involved in efforts by GM employees to investigate and isolate ignition-switch failures, going back to 2004
Specifics about the reason engineering modifications proposes in 2004 and 2005 were not implemented in production vehicles
Information about the events following a 2007 meeting between regulators and GM, in which the two parties discussed an air bag failure after a Cobalt lost engine power
Why GM North American President Alan Batey said that automaker s  process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been,  along with details about how the process will be changed
NHTSA spokesperson Nathan Naylor said in a statement that,  We are a data-driven organization, and we will take whatever action is appropriate based on where our findings lead us. 
Adding more complexity to the situation is a GM technical service bulletin to dealers from 2006 describing the issue; GM didn t issue a a recall until 2014. Notably, a research team informed U.S. automotive safety regulators in 2007 of a possible link between defective ignition switches and airbags not deploying.
In a statement dated February 25th, GM stated that it was  deeply sorry , while CEO Barra stated on March 5th that the automaker has commenced an internal investigation to provide an  unvarnished report on what happened. 
To note, the initial recall on February 13th was limited to 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s was expanded less than two weeks later to include more than 800,000 additional vehicles, including 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice, and the 2006-2007 Saturn Sky. Other affected models not sold in the U.S. include the Canadian-market 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuit and the European-market 2007 Opel GT.

NEW YORK   Federal safety regulators received more than 260 complaints over the past 11 years about General Motors vehicles that suddenly turned off while being driven, but they declined to investigate the problem, which GM now says is linked to 13 deaths and requires the recall of more than 1.6 million cars worldwide.
A New York Times analysis of consumer complaints submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that since February 2003 it received an average of two complaints a month about potentially dangerous shutdowns, but it repeatedly responded that there was not enough evidence of a problem to warrant a safety investigation.

The complaints   the most recent of which was filed Thursday   involved six GM models that the automaker is now recalling because of defective ignition switches that can shut off engines and power systems and disable air bags. GM said the first recall notices were mailed Friday to vehicle owners.
Many of the complaints detailed frightening scenes in which moving cars suddenly stalled at high speeds, on highways, in traffic, and while crossing railroad tracks. A number of the complaints warned of catastrophic consequences if something was not done.

 When the vehicle shuts down, it gives no warning, it just does it,  wrote one driver of a 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt.  I drive my car to and from work praying that it won t shut down on me while on the freeway. 
Another driver wrote of the same model:  Engine stops while driving   cannot steer nor brake so controlling the car to a safe stop is very dangerous. 
To the mounting complaints, the safety agency sometimes responded with polite but formulaic letters similar to one it sent in December 2010 to Barney Frank, then a congressman from Massachusetts, who had written on behalf of a distraught constituent whose 2006 Cobalt kept stalling.

In the letter to Frank, the agency said it had reviewed its database of complaints to determine if a  safety defect trend  existed.  At this time, there is insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation,  the letter concluded.
Failure to recognize a pattern in complaints has been a problem for the safety agency before. In the late 1990s, it was criticized for failing to detect a wave of highway rollovers in Ford Explorers with Firestone tires, a problem that was eventually linked to 271 deaths.
In response, Congress passed a law in 2000 requiring automakers to report to the safety agency any claims they received blaming defects for serious injuries or deaths, so the government would not have to rely only on consumer reports.
Since 2003, GM has reported at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries involving the now-recalled cars, according to a review of agency records. Though the records mention potentially defective components, how many of these records were related to the ignition problem is unclear. Even with that additional information, regulators appear to have overlooked complaints of  shutdowns.
 We need to make it clear to both industry members and regulators that adverse events must be immediately reported and analyzed to ensure public safety,  said Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, a Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The panel s staff is set to meet with the safety agency Monday.
The safety agency has repeatedly suggested that it failed to act over the years because of a lack of a critical mass of evidence that suggested a problem beyond isolated incidents.
In a statement e-mailed to The New York Times, a spokesman noted that over the past seven years, the agency s investigations in other cases have resulted in 929 recalls of more than 55 million vehicles.
The agency  uses a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data and look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall,  the statement said. The agency said 260 complaints are about 0.018 percent of the vehicles under recall.
The recall has thrown GM into turmoil just as it was emerging from the shadow of bankruptcy under new chief executive Mary T. Barra, and as the agency stepped up pressure on GM in late February by launching an investigation into the  timeliness  of GM s  defect determination.  Last week the agency sent the company 107 questions, demanding it explain why it had waited so long to recall the vehicles.
But the Times review of thousands of complaints stored in the agency s public database raises questions about the agency s own timeliness. The newspaper analyzed nearly 8,000 complaints about the recalled models to find instances when drivers may have been affected by faulty ignition.
The 260-plus total includes only complaints that mentioned a moving car stalling unexpectedly. It does not include the complaints filed about basic ignition problems on these models, like trouble starting or stopping a car s engine, or failures of the power steering mechanism, even though these could have stemmed from an inadvertent ignition shutdown. People may have filed multiple complaints about the same car.
Greg Martin, a GM spokesman, said the company monitors complaints to the NHTSA about its vehicles but declined to say how the agency responded to ignition switch complaints.
By the time the agency wrote to Frank in 2010, it had received more than 170 complaints about unexpected stopping or stalling of the recalled GM models, and 35 specifically for the 2006 Cobalt. The Cobalt has been a particularly problematic model for GM.
The recall covers six models: 2005-07  Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices and the 2007 Saturn Sky. Both the agency and GM are warning motorists that if they must drive a recalled vehicle, no keys other than the car key should be on the key chain to eliminate  jostling that could shut down the ignition.
In announcing the recalls, GM said the ignition defect may have been responsible for 31 accidents and 13 deaths, but it has declined to disclose the names of those who died or  details of the crashes. GM said it had been  involved in claims and lawsuits  related to the ignition problem, but did not disclose how many settlements had been reached.

Report: US Agency Ignored Complaints About GM Ignition Problems
By Todd Beamon   |   Saturday, 08 Mar 2014 05:57 PM
Close 
     A   A
  
Federal regulators refused to investigate the faulty ignition problems of General Motors cars   even after receiving more than 260 complaints about them leading to cars shutting off unexpectedly over the past 11 years, The New York Times reports .
The ignition-switch problems have spurred a worldwide recall of more than 1.6 million cars announced by the Detroit-based automaker this week. GM had expanded the recall from an initial 779,000 vehicles.
The defects have been linked to 31 incidents   including 13 front-seat deaths that may have resulted because airbags did not operate properly, GM said.
The vehicles affected are Saturn Ion compact autos from the 2003 through 2007 model years, Chevy HHR mid-sized vehicles from 2006 and 2007, and the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007.
GM no longer makes any of the models, which have had problems for 10 years, the Times reports.
The newspaper analyzed 8,000 consumer complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal agency charged with addressing such matters. It found that the agency had received an average of two complaints per month since February 2003.
The Times zeroed in on the over 260 complaints that concerned moving cars that stalled unexpectedly. The most recent complaint was filed on Thursday.
However, NHTSA repeatedly responded that the complaints lacked sufficient evidence to warrant a full safety investigation, the Times reports.
"At this time, there is insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation," the agency told former Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., in a December 2010 letter quoted by the Times.
Frank, who retired last year, had written the agency on behalf of a constituent whose 2006 Cobalt stalled repeatedly, the Times reports. It told Frank that it reached its conclusion after reviewing its database of complaints on the issue.
 The ability to spot trends is a huge issue, and NHTSA has not got it under control by any means,  Joan Claybrook, who headed the agency during the Jimmy Carter White House, told the Times.
But the agency's chief counsel, Kevin Vincent, said that complaints must pass a legal test of "unreasonable risk to safety" to warrant an investigation.
"That term 'reasonable' is a legal term, which is very elastic and means a lot of different things in a lot of different contexts," he told the Times. "Each case is a different fact pattern."
Last week, NHTSA sent GM 107 questions, demanding why it took the carmaker so long to recall the vehicles, the Times reports.

Did Federal Investigators Delay Action In GM Recall Case?
Leading safety advocates call for independent investigation of NHTSA
Peter Bigelow
Federal safety investigators put General Motors under a microscope earlier this week, asking the troubled automaker 107 detailed questions about its decade-long delay in recalling cars with a deadly defect. Now, it may be the federal government's turn to face questions.
The Center for Auto Safety, one of the nation's leading automotive safety organizations, wants to know why federal regulators failed to act even though they had knowledge of the ignition-switch problem since 2007.
In a letter sent this morning , Clarence Ditlow, the organization's president, said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration not only failed to protect motorists, but charged it kept details of its preliminary inquiries secret and "effectively helped GM cover up this defect."
"While GM bears completely responsibility for failing to recall these vehicles by 2005, when it knew what the defect was and how to fix it, NHTSA has responsibility for failing to order a recall by early 2007," Ditlow wrote. "... People died and the agency shares responsibility for their deaths with GM."
Although documents show General Motors knew about the dangerous ignition switch problem in 2004, the company did not recall any vehicles until February, when GM announced it would recall more than 1.37 million vehicles, including certain models of the Chevrolet Cobalt and Chevrolet HHR , the Saturn Ion and Saturn Sky and Pontiac G5 and Pontiac Solstice .
So far, 13 deaths and 31 crashes have been attributed to the problem, in which the ignition switch inadvertently moves from the "run" to "accessory" position, and cuts power to both the engine and airbags .
Could the death toll grow? The Center for Auto Safety says NHTSA received at least 51 reports of death claims from GM via its Early Warning Reporting system between 2004 and 2012. Federal investigators sought more information in at least 29 of the 51 reports, including 17 records prior to a meeting in 2007.
On March 29 of that year, NHTSA investigators and GM representatives met to discuss a crash that killed a 16-year-old Maryland girl whose airbags did not deploy in a 2005 Cobalt .
Details from that meeting are unknown, but following it, NHTSA stopped seeking more information about similar crashes. Prior to 2007, NHTSA sent GM inquiries on 90 percent of crashes submitted to the Early Warning Report system; after 2007, the agency sought more information in only 38 percent of deadly cases, according to the Center for Auto Safety.
"Americans need NHTSA's Early Warning Reporting system to actually provide early warnings, instead of just a rear-view mirror look into what has already gone wrong," Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said Friday. "If NHTSA won't take action to greatly increase public disclosure of information related to potential safety defects, I will introduce legislation ensuring that it does so."
Former NHTSA administrator Joan Claybrook echoed Markey's displeasure with the agency she used to lead. On Friday, she sent a letter to the inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation asking for an independent investigation into NHTSA's failure to require a recall.
"No one is evaluating why NHTSA failed to carry out the law," she said. "I am asking you to undertake a full evaluation of this failure, taking into consideration the overt secrecy the agency now imposes on most of its defect investigation work so that the public is deterred from pressing the agency to act."
Earlier this week, Claybrook called upon new General Motors CEO Mary Barra to send a recall notice to consumers that underscores the severity of the ignition-switch problem.

ANALYSIS-GM must address recall soon to avoid damage to reputation
March 07, 2014|Reuters
DETROIT, March 7 (Reuters) - General Motors Co needs
to get through its ignition-switch recall and the resulting
federal investigation quickly to avoid any lasting damage to its
brand, but the federal probe could keep the problem in the
public eye for at least six months.
Analysts and academics warn that a misstep by GM could leave
it with a lingering headache, something Toyota Motor Corp
experienced from 2009 to 2011 with recalls linked to
sudden acceleration. The Japanese automaker was criticized for
being slow to react to complaints and initially blaming the
drivers.
GM is currently interviewing employees dating back to the
discovery in 2004 of the problem with the ignition switch, which
has since been linked to 13 deaths, sources previously said.
Meanwhile, U.S. safety regulators have opened an investigation
into whether the No. 1 U.S. automaker reacted swiftly enough in
its recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles.
GM Chief Executive Mary Barra on Tuesday in a letter to GM
employees said she deeply regretted the circumstances but was
pleased with the company's response and the focus will be on
customer safety and satisfaction.
Moving past the recall and related fallout will be critical
to ensure the Detroit company continues the rebound since its
2009 bankruptcy reorganization, analysts said.
"They need to get past this as quickly as possible," said
George Cook, a marketing professor at the Simon Business School
at the University of Rochester.
"You cannot be reactive in dealing with the American
car-buying public," added Cook, formerly an executive at Ford
Motor Co for 10 years. "You have to be proactive and I
think they'll be forgiving if it's not really, really serious.
People have short memories about that stuff."
GM's recall was to correct a condition that may allow the
engine and other components, including front airbags, to be
unintentionally turned off.
GM has said the weight on the key ring, road conditions or
some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move
out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of
the car's electrical components. GM has recommended that owners
use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.
The company said last week that the initial replacement
parts will be available in early April.
Trent Ross, senior vice president of reputation and risk
management at Ipsos Public Affairs, said GM needs to take
ownership of the issue right away. Several analysts lauded Barra
for her letter.
"GM needs to show it's doing the right thing," he said. "And
Mary Barra has to demonstrate that the buck stops with the CEO."
In her letter to employees, Barra emphasized that whether
the company's reputation and sales suffer is not the issue.
"Our company's reputation won't be determined by the recall
itself, but by how we address the problem going forward," she
said.
GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from U.S. National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration in addition to recall
costs it has not outlined. Analysts agreed the big costs could
come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.
Toyota, for instance, settled economic-loss claims in its
case for more than $1 billion and is negotiating settlement of
hundreds of personal-injury lawsuits. It also is in talks to
settle a criminal probe by the U.S. Justice Department for a
reported $1 billion.
However, that has not hurt sales or stopped Toyota from
ranking highly in consumer quality rankings conducted by J.D.
Power and Associates, suggesting that any damage to GM could be
fleeting, analysts said.
GM's case could take time, however, given the Detroit
company's internal probe and the investigation opened by the
NHTSA, which Cook said could last at least six months.
Allan Kam, a former enforcement attorney with NHTSA, said
the agency's 107-question "special order" was unusual. "I've
never seen one quite as detailed as this one," he said.
Kam speculated GM would prefer to settle the NHTSA probe in
a way that would allow its answers not to be published widely.
However, the mounting pressure on NHTSA, with members of
Congress sending letters of inquiry, may make that outcome
unlikely.

General Motors' problems with its recall of roughly 1.6-million vehicles continue to mount . Now that it has emerged that GM knew about the problem since at least 2004 but waited to recall vehicles until February 2014, regulators at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have begun a much deeper investigation . NHTSA has sent a 27-page survey to GM that includes 107 questions about the timeline of what led up to the recall, and it has until April 3 to reply.
This isn't a simple, multiple-choice test. Automotive News believes that hundreds of pages could be required to answer some of the queries. NHTSA says that it is still investigating GM's response to the recall. "We are a data-driven organization, and we will take whatever action is appropriate based on where our findings lead us," said NHTSA in a statement on its website . If found liable, the automaker could face a fine as high as $35 million and even possible criminal charges, according to Bloomberg .
NHTSA's questions include a detailed explanation of GM's examination process; how it will improve the process; why a planned redesign of the cars' key in 2005 wasn't implemented; and specific data on each complaint it received. According to Bloomberg, NHTSA also has records that show the company had a meeting with regulators to discuss the airbag failure in a Chevrolet Cobalt in 2007.
New GM CEO Mary Barra has also hired an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation about what happened. It will include questioning company employees who were involved with the process from the start. The recall stems from faulty ignition switches that shut off the car while driving, and if it occurs the airbags deactivate. Thirteen deaths and 23 crashes have been caused by the problem, according to Bloomberg. If you would like to peruse NHTSA's entire questionnaire for GM, it can be viewed here .

General Motors is in big big trouble! No, they re not headed for bankruptcy again, but they have a lot of questions to answer in regard to their huge ignition switch-related vehicle recall. 107 questions, that is!
They re all included in the recent 27-page special order issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as part of a timeline query investigation of the Detroit-based automaker. The agency requests that GM provides answers to question about the event leading up to the recall, but it also asks for the documents that the company used to prepare the recall timeline.
Additionally, the NHTSA has also requested details about each of the 23 crashes linked to the faulty ignition switch, including all depositions and testimonies from lawsuits related to this issue (the ignition switch failures were linked to 13 deaths).
And that s not all. The feds also want names an correspondence from any employee involved in efforts to investigate and isolate ignition switch failures going back to 2004 and specifics about the reason engineering modifications proposed in 2004/2005 were not implemented in production vehicles. More over, the NHTSA wants to find out why company president Alan Batey said GM s  process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robuts as it should have been .
We bet these requests will cause a lot of severe head aches at GM, especially as the NHTSA asked that the manufacturer must respond to the special order by April 3, 2014.  We are a data-driven organization, and we will take whatever action is appropriate based on where our findings lead us,  said NHTSA spokesperson Nathan Naylor.
The ignition switch recall was initially announced in mid-February, when GM said it will recall more than 600,000 units of the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2007 Pontiac G5. Later the same month, the company updated the recall to include the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and 2006-2007 Saturn Sky. This recall also affects the 2007 Opel GT, which was sold in Europe, and the Canadian-market 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuit.
In these vehicles,  the weight on the key ring and/or road conditions or some other jarring event may cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position, turning off the engine. If the key is not in the run position, the air bags may not deploy if the vehicle is involved in a crash, increasing the risk of injury,  the safety agency said in a bulletin.
 We are deeply sorry and we are working to address this issue as quickly as we can,  Batey said when the final recall statement was released.
If the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concludes that General Motors failed to report the safety problem in five business days, as stated by federal regulations, the Detroit-based automaker could be forced to pay a financial penalty of up to $35 million .

DETROIT   U.S. safety regulators are demanding that General Motors turn over reams of documents and other data showing what the company knew and when it found out about a dangerous ignition problem that has been linked to 13 car-crash deaths.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating how GM handled the problem, which triggered the global recall of 1.6 million older-model compact cars. GM has acknowledged it knew of the ignition troubles a decade ago but didn t recall the cars until last month.
In a 27-page order sent to GM Tuesday, NHTSA demanded pictures, memos, electronic communications, engineering drawings and other data to answer 107 questions. The reply, which must be signed under oath by a company officer, is due on April 3. GM spokesman Alan Adler said Wednesday that the company is cooperating.
NHTSA wants the documents to determine if GM delayed its response or withheld evidence. In either case, it could fine GM up to $35 million. Automakers are required to inform NHTSA of safety defects within five days of discovering them. Such a fine would be a record for NHTSA, but essentially is pocket change for GM, which made $3.8 billion last year.
Included in the order is a series of questions about when GM discovered the ignition problem in 2004 and the identity of employees involved in finding and replicating it. The order asks what fixes GM considered  including the lead time required, costs and effectiveness of each of the solutions. 
On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007).
Facts surrounding the recall are embarrassing for GM and could scare away consumers. Since leaving a painful bankruptcy in 2009, GM has cut bureaucracy, improved vehicle quality and is quicker to recall cars when problems occur. However, its admission that recall procedures were lacking 10 years ago shows how the old culture can still haunt the automaker.
In an effort to reassure employees and customers, GM s new CEO Mary Barra on Tuesday promised an  unvarnished  internal investigation to figure out what happened and prevent it from recurring.
 We want our customers to know that today s GM is committed to fixing this problem in a manner that earns their trust,  GM s Adler said.
Even as NHTSA pressures GM for details, safety advocates say the agency bears some blame for the automaker s slow recall response. NHTSA said Wednesday in a statement that it s a data-driven agency  and we will take whatever action is appropriate based on where our findings lead us. 
The maximum fine NHTSA can charge was more than doubled last year under legislation approved by Congress after Toyota unintended acceleration recalls. But critics say it still isn t enough to deter bad behavior.
GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch in the recalled vehicles to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power. That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags. In the fatalities, the air bags did not inflate, but the engines did not shut off in all cases, GM said.
It was unclear whether the ignition switches caused the crashes, or whether people died because the air bags didn t inflate.

Law360, New York (March 6, 2014,  5:08 PM EST) -- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Wednesday revved up an investigation into General Motors Co. s failure to recall 1.4 million compact cars until last month over a dangerous ignition switch problem that engineers supposedly uncovered in 2004, ordering the carmaker to flesh out its chronology of events.
A 27-page letter ordered GM to fill in a substantial number of gaps in its accounting of an internal probe of a defect in the ignition system of several older Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn models that can cut...

Less than two months after taking over General Motors and being hailed as a sign of how much the country's largest automaker has changed, CEO Mary Barra is facing a huge test.
Can she steer GM through a recall investigation that threatens to damage the automaker's reputation?

General Motors CEO Mary Barra
The automaker's latest headache is how it handled the recall of 1.37 million vehicles sold in the U.S. with a faulty ignition key. Some of those keys, while in the ignition, could inadvertently move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and some of the electrical components. One of the side effects was that the airbags could unintentionally be turned off.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there have been 31 accidents and 13 deaths related to the faulty keys.

)
For GM, the issue which involves 2003 to 2007 models dates to 2004, when questions about the key surfaced. But it wasn't until early in 2014 that the automaker issued a recall. That time lag is at the heart of a special order from the legal counsel office at the NHTSA
What did GM executives know?
When did they know it?
And did they move as quickly as the law requires to issue a full recall of the ignition keys?

)
Those are just a few of the questions the agency wants GM to answer. In a letter sent to the automaker on Tuesday requesting detailed answers to 107 questions related to the recall it's clear federal investigators are not treating this probe as a routine inquiry. NHTSA wants answers, and it wants them by April 3.
Barra knows just how serious the investigation is for her company. The same day NHTSA sent its list of questions to GM, she announced the automaker had "launched an internal review to give us an unvarnished report on what happened."
In a letter to employees, Barra said, "First and foremost, everything we are doing is guided by one unwavering principle: Do what is best for our customer. Customer safety and satisfaction are at the heart of every decision we make."

There's no reason to believe Barra is not sincere. She knows General Motors has to move quickly to stop the lingering questions about the safety and quality of its models.
It didn't help matters that Alan Batey, the new president of GM's operation in North America, issued a statement in late February, saying GM's handling of the recall investigation "was not as robust as it should have been."
Allan Kam, a former senior enforcement attorney for NHTSA who is now an automotive safety consultant, said the latest moves by federal investigators were noteworthy.
"This is not a routine inquiry," Kam said. "I've never seen a special order from NHTSA this detailed."
Lingering impact for GM?
Since GM issued the first recall for ignition keys in early February, the story has festered and steadily gained more attention. It has prompted GM to twice issue public apologies, where the company has said the recall is not an indication of how the automaker wants to conduct business.
On paper that sounds good. In reality, the NHTSA inquiry casts serious doubt on GM's claims.
It's unclear what impact the recall has had on sales, as harsh winter weather has hurt business for all automakers. The company most recently reported a sales dip of 1 percent in the month of February.

)
In any case, Barra and her leaders need to move quickly to end the ongoing questions about the safety of GM cars and trucks.
It doesn't matter that the models in question with this recall are no longer being built.
What matters is the perception, fair or not, that General Motors dragged its feet announcing a recall surrounding the deaths of 13 people.
When Barra was selected as CEO, many said it was symbolic of the new GM. She was held up as the hope GM would drive even further from the bad habits that tarnished its reputation before it slid into bankruptcy.
Ironically, it's the actions of GM in those "pre-bankruptcy" years when it was known as a slow-moving conglomerate that reacted slowly to change that are now haunting the automaker and its new chief.

U.S. safety agency demands documents, data from GM over recall
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration wants to know how automaker handled ignition problem

DETROIT Safety regulators in the United States are demanding that General Motors (GM) turn over reams of documents and other data showing what the company knew about a dangerous ignition problem that has been linked to 13 fatal car crashes.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is investigating how GM handled the problem, which triggered the global recall of 1.6 million older-model compact cars.
GM has acknowledged it knew of the ignition troubles a decade ago but didn t recall the cars until last month.
In a 27-page order sent to GM, NHTSA demanded pictures, memos, electronic communications, engineering drawings and other data to answer 107 questions.
The reply, which must be signed under oath by a company officer, is due April 3.
GM spokesperson Alan Adler said this week the company is co-operating.
NHTSA wants the documents to determine if GM delayed its response or withheld evidence.
In either case, it could fine GM up to US$35-million.
Automakers are required to inform NHTSA of safety defects within five days of discovering them.
Such a fine would be a record for NHTSA, but essentially is pocket change for GM, which made US$3.8-billion last year.
Included in the order is a series of questions about when GM discovered the ignition problem in 2004 and the identity of employees involved in finding and replicating it.
The order asks what fixes GM considered,  including the lead time required, costs and effectiveness of each of the solutions. 
On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s from the 2005 to 2007 model years.
Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts from 2003 to 2007, and Chevrolet HHR wagons and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 to 2007.
Facts surrounding the recall are embarrassing for GM and could scare away consumers.
Since leaving a painful bankruptcy in 2009, GM has cut bureaucracy, improved vehicle quality and is quicker to recall cars when problems occur.
However, its admission that recall procedures were lacking 10 years ago shows how the old culture can still haunt the automaker.
In an effort to reassure employees and customers, GM s new CEO, Mary Barra, promised an  unvarnished  internal investigation to figure out what happened and prevent it from recurring.
 We want our customers to know that today s GM is committed to fixing this problem in a manner that earns their trust,  GM s Adler said.
Even as NHTSA pressures GM for details, safety advocates say the agency bears some blame for the automaker s slow recall response.
NHTSA said in a statement this week that it s a data-driven agency  and we will take whatever action is appropriate based on where our findings lead us. 
The maximum fine NHTSA can charge was more than doubled last year under legislation approved by Congress after Toyota Motor Corp. s unintended acceleration recalls.
But critics say it still isn t enough to deter bad behaviour.
GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch in the recalled vehicles to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power.
That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags.
In the fatalities, the air bags did not inflate, but the engines did not shut off in all cases, GM said.
It was unclear whether the ignition switches caused the crashes, or whether people died because the air bags didn t inflate.

General Motors is recalling an additional 824,000 to replace the ignition switches. That means all model years of its Chevrolet Cobalt, HHR, Pontiac G5, Solstice and Saturn Ion and Sky in the U.S. will get new switches because faulty switches may have been used to repair the vehicles.
The parts are at the center of the company s recently announced ignition switch recall , which originally extended through the 2007 model year. About 95,000 faulty switches were sold to dealers and aftermarket wholesalers. Of those, about 90,000 were used to repair older vehicles that were repaired before they were recalled in February.
Recalling everything
Because it is not feasible to track down all the parts, the company is recalling 824,000 more vehicles in the U.S. to ensure that every car has a current ignition switch. GM says it is unaware of any reports of fatalities with this group of vehicles where a frontal impact occurred, the front air bags did not deploy and the ignition is in the  accessory  or  off  position.
As with the earlier recalls, if the torque performance is not to GM specification, the ignition switch may unintentionally move from the  run  position to the  accessory  or  off  positions, leading to a loss of power. The risk may be increased if the key ring is carrying added weight or if the vehicle goes off road or experiences some jarring event.
The timing of the key movement out of the  run  position relative to when the sensing algorithm of a crash may result in the air bags not deploying, increasing the potential for occupant injury in certain kinds of crashes.
Until the recall has been performed, GM is urging customers to remove all items -- including the key fob -- from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key.
 We are taking no chances with safety,  said GM CEO Mary Barra.  Trying to locate several thousand switches in a population of 2.2 million vehicles and distributed to thousands of retailers isn t practical. Out of an abundance of caution, we are recalling the rest of the model years.
 We are going to provide our customers with the peace of mind they deserve and expect by getting the new switches into all the vehicles,  Barra said.
Affected models
GM records indicate the service parts may have been used for ignition repairs in:
2008-2010 Chevrolet Cobalts

Both General Motors and the federal agency that oversees its compliance with safety standards are under fire for who said what to whom   and when, precisely   regarding a faulty ignition switch in certain discontinued models that has reportedly led to airbags being disabled under some conditions.  
 Thirteen deaths have been linked to the problem switch, which was used in some Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac G5 and Solstice, Saturn Ion and Sky models,  dating back to the launch of the Cobalt in 2004, Jeff Bennett reports in the Wall Street Journal.  GM has said a jarring of the ignition key or too much weight on a key ring attached to the ignition key can cause the switch to turn off, disabling power to the air bags.

The switch was not replaced until the 2007 model year; the recall took nearly a decade.       
 In an unusual move, General Motors CEO Mary Barra says she's personally directing the recall of 1.37 million GM cars,  writes USA Today s James R. Healy, pointing out that  GM president Dan Ammann came close to directly blaming the  old  GM,  in telling Automotive News at the Geneva Motor Show:  This is a new leadership team. We're aiming to do things in the right way."
"We're doing everything we can to work with our customers and our dealers to get everything as straight as we can," Ammann told Automotive News Mike Colias and Nick Bunkley.
That includes an internal investigation for which it has hired an outside law firm that is questioning employees, WSJ s Bennett reports. 
 GM had maintained before the recall that the cars involved were safe because they can be steered and stopped, even when the key slips out of  run,  turns off the engine and eliminates power assist to the steering and brakes and disables some safety systems,  write James R. Healey and Greg Gardner in the Detroit Free-Press.  GM also has noted that in many of the crashes now linked to the problem that lack of seatbelt use and alcohol were factors. 
In a document that in parts seems a Pythonesque parody of  legalese    The singular includes the plural; the plural includes the singular. The masculine includes the feminine and neuter genders; the neuter gender includes the masculine and feminine genders    the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a special order to GM with 107 specific questions it wants answered. 
One in particular   No. 27   that is drawing a lot of attention in the 27-page document is a statement by GM North America president Alan Batey in a press release Feb. 25 about the expansion of the recall. In it, he admitted,  the chronology shows that the process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been. 
The NHTSA want to know exactly how it  was not as robust  as well  its plans (if any) to change its process.  
 NHTSA also asked GM to name all employees or engineers involved in the ignition switch production whether they worked for GM or part supplier Delphi Automotive, which made the ignition switches,  Bennett reports.
 The company is fully cooperating with NHTSA s probe and welcomes  the opportunity to help the agency have a full understanding of the facts,  a GM spokesman, Alan Adler, said in an e-mailed statement today,  reports Bloomberg s Jeff Plungis.
Indeed, General Motors appears to be trying to appear to be as transparent as possible in is current investigation of its past investigation. 
In a letter to employees posted on the GM website Tuesday, CEO Barra wrote that the inquiry  has led some to ask if the recall of these out-of-production vehicles might affect our company s reputation or sales of our current models.  
Her response is  our company s reputation won t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward. 
Indeed, Jeremy Robinson-Leon, COO at crisis public relations firm Group Gordon, tells Healey that Barra is  staking her reputation on handling this properly. 
 Our process for determining whether and when to recall a vehicle is decided by experienced technical experts. They do their work independent of managers with responsibilities for other aspects of the business, so that their decisions are made solely on technical facts and engineering analysis,  Barra wrote in her email.  When this was brought to my team a few weeks ago, we acted without hesitation to go well beyond the decision by the technical experts. 
The NHTSA is facing scrutiny itself.
 The safety agency has come under mounting pressure over its own failure to act on complaints about the recalled GM cars,  Christopher Jensen reports in the New York Times.  Twice, it has taken an in-depth look at fatal crashes, but has never begun a broader investigation. 
Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) last month  sent a letter to the agency saying that significant improvements were needed in the way it gathers information about potential defects,  Jensen writes, but the agency replied that the data it had did not  warrant   opening a formal investigation.

New GM CEO Begins Review of Recall Procedure
March 6, 2014
General Motors  new CEO is starting an internal review of the company s practices after an embarrassing recall of 1.6 million older small cars .
CEO Mary Barra says in an e-mail to employees that the review will hold the company accountable and improve processes so the problem doesn t happen again.
Last week GM doubled the number of cars included in a global recall of small cars for faulty ignition switches that have been linked to 13 deaths. The company issued a rare apology for the slow response and admitted it knew of the problem a decade ago.
Barra says she s also leading a group of executives who will handle the response and monitor progress on the recall. She says GM s reputation will be determined by how the company handles the problem.

During the period when the HBO Go app went  down last night due to the number of folks trying to watch the finale of  True Detective,  I figured I might as well check in on Fox s  Cosmos,  a reboot based off the beloved Carl Sagan series of the  80s.  If I couldn t get my dose of Harrelson and McConaughey , I might as well have a bit of the charismatic  Cosmos  host, Neil deGrasse Tyson.
For 15 minutes I was confused and disappointed at Fox s version, jumping back to HBO the moment opportunity presented itself.   While educational science programming on a major network during the precious Sunday night time slot is laudable, this series premiere s format didn t cut it.  I understand why creators wanted to use the calendar analogy to make geological timeframes more approachable.  I understand their desire to use as much CGI as possible to illustrate the glory of the universe, and thus, science.  I understand the urge to have Tyson walking through different time periods, a shepherd for the birth of the world as we know it. 
But, as a whole, it doesn t work.  There are too many things happening on too many levels.  The appearance of Tyson standing next to early Earthly species was disconcerting in a way that  Who Framed Roger Rabbit  never was (even with moments like THIS ).  Then there are those wonky animations   what the heck?  It was like a 10-year-old proficient in Final Cut went through an array of Oscar-shunned animated features, picked some disturbing stuff about medieval scientists and cobbled it together with a poorly presented TED talk.  Gross. 
It may be  dazzling  as some critics are saying, but only dazzling in the sense of an expensive, confetti-laden train derailing .  There s plenty of other, worthier science programming out there, so avoid this watered down, disjointed monstrosity.

A program that is airing on multiple channels   including 10 in the U.S.   and in 181 countries worldwide is expected to be watched by 40 million people this week.
TheWrap.com reports that Fox is projecting that number for its  Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,  which debuted Sunday to a U.S. audience of 8.5 million people across 10 networks.
"Based on this U.S. Live + Same Day performance and the additional countries in which it will be airing this week, Fox is projecting that the global total audience number for the  Cosmos  premiere this week will be more than 40 million," the story reports. "On the main Fox broadcast network itself,  Cosmos  received a 2.1 rating in the advertiser-sought 18-49 demographic, and had 5.8 million viewers."
The competition Sunday on both broadcast and cable was stiff, the report notes, with ABC s premiere of  Resurrection  delivering a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demo and 13.6 million viewers, while HBO s finale of  True Detective  had 3.5 million total viewers and AMC s  Walking Dead  pulled in 12.7 million.
"In the U.S., [ Cosmos ] debuted on Fox, National Geographic Channel, FX, FXX, FXM, Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2, Nat Geo Wild, Nat Geo Mundo and Fox Life," the report notes. "Internationally, the series debut will be available on a total of 220 channels in 181 countries."
The show is an update on Carl Sagan s 1980 program "Cosmos: A Personal Voyage," with the new version hosted by astrophysicist Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

'Cosmos' return puts science and religion under the scope

From left, executive producer Mitchell Cannold, executive producer/director Brannon Braga, host Neil DeGrasse Tyson, executive producer Seth MacFarlane and executive producer/writer Ann Druyan participate in FOX's "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey" panel at the FOX Winter TCA Press Tour, on Monday, January 13, 2014 at the Langham Huntington, in Pasadena, Calif.
"Cosmos," a highly anticipated series that explores the universe and attempts to make science entertaining for everyone, is causing some to examine the tension between religion and science.
The series, a revamped version of the immensely popular 1980 documentary, premiered Sunday. The series' host, Neil deGrasse Tyson, a renowned astrophysicist, told CNN's Brian Stelter he wants the series to appeal to everyone, including those "who don't know that they like science" and "the people who know they don't like science at all."
The Wire contributor Danielle Wiener-Bronner believes Tyson tried to meet his goal to appeal to a wide audience in the first episode by "inviting religious viewers to identify with scientists," but she also believes Tyson was attempting to persuade his religious audience to subscribe to evolution.
"There was no ambiguity about the fact that Tyson wants its viewers to see the scientifically oppressed as akin to the religiously martyred," says Wiener-Bronner. She explains that the shows' use of the story of Giordano Bruno, a monk who was persecuted and executed for having heretical views about the universe, was similar to a Christian martyr story.
Wiener-Bronner's fellow Wire contributor Abby Ohlheiser agrees with Wiener-Bronner, but she hopes religious individuals will perceive the Bruno story "as a redrawing of the boundaries between faith and science" rather than a condemnation of religion.
"Instead of putting the two in opposition, the show wants to place faith, curiosity, wonder, and questioning   what if my God is too small? to paraphrase Bruno   along with science against enforced ignorance," says Ohlheiser.
Other writers feel the new "Cosmos" is not sympathetic to religion. "The new 'Cosmos' feels like a pushback against faith s encroachments on the intellectual terrain of science," writes Matt Zoller Seitz in Vulture.
And Tony Rossi wrote for Patheos that "Cosmos" inaccurately showed religion condemning and oppressing science, especially in the case of Bruno, who wasn t a scientist. And, Rossi said, Bruno was outcast because of his anti-God beliefs and not his perception of the universe.
 The show s presentation of science will likely be brilliant and visually stunning, hopefully opening people s minds to the wonder and complexity of the universe,  wrote Rossi.  But it should have stayed within the parameters of its own expertise   or at least provided an unbiased look at the whole story of what actually happened. A show and worldview that thrive on empirical evidence should have the sense and integrity to apply that approach to all aspects of its storytelling. 
In an update to the post, Rossi argued that the show portrayed the Catholic Church in a negative light, but didn t address any of the broader views on space from the church s standpoint.
 Killing people who disagree with us is indefensible, and the church was wrong to do so,  Rossi said.  Still, it s a church with a 2,000-year history that shouldn t just be defined by the times it was wrong. 
Tyson told CNN he is frustrated by the debates about religion and science that constantly appear in op-ed articles and political campaigns.
"There was a time when science and religion kind of co-existed under the same roof," Tyson said. "I find it odd that we live in a time where people who are strongly religious want to make everyone else the same kind of religious way they are, and break down the door of the science classroom to put their religious philosophies in there."
While some might think the new show is arguing against religion and faith, Slate writer Willa Paskin argued that the show is giving a uniting message about God.
 Organized religion certainly comes in for it, but I think this segment is up to something more gentle than declaring war on blinkered anti-science evangelists,  Paskin wrote.   Cosmos  is offering viewers a way to reconcile science and faith: Don t let your god be too small.

Was " Cosmos : A Spacetime Odyssey" a red giant in the TV ratings or more of a white dwarf?
Well, that depends on whom you ask.
The science-minded people at Fox predict that Sunday's premiere of "Family Guy" producer Seth MacFarlane 's reboot of the classic Carl Sagan docu-series   this time hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson   will be seen by more than 40 million total viewers this week, according to Nielsen numbers. 
How did the network arrive at that figure? Nielsen estimates that a total of 8.5 million watched Sunday on a total of 10 Fox-owned networks, including Fox broadcast, National Geographic and FX. Throw in foreign territories and time-delayed viewing via DVR, and supposedly you'll quintuple that figure by week's end.

That sounds a bit blinded by science, though. "Cosmos" failed to throw off much light on Fox Sunday, gathering fewer than 6 million total viewers despite heavy promotion. It was trounced by ABC's premiere of "Resurrection," a life-after-death drama that animated more than 13 million.
Fox points out that "Cosmos" aired against some heavy competition, which besides "Resurrection" included AMC 's zombie smash "The Walking Dead" (12.7 million) and HBO's season finale of the critically acclaimed crime drama "True Detective" (3.5 million).
Which is all true enough, but then again there are people who do TV scheduling for a living and Fox knew what the whiteboard looked like when "Cosmos" was put there. But we still have 12 more episodes to see if "Cosmos" catches on.
What do you think of the show?

TV Review:  Cosmos: Standing Up In The Milky Way 
Posted Monday, March 10th, 2014 05:00 pm GMT -4 by Alison "Boom" Baumgartner
Years ago, the science community and children of the eighties poked their meerkat-ish heads up at the mention of a  Cosmos  remake.  Could it be true?  they wondered,  Is the world really ready to come back to science? 
Well, it s a little too soon to answer that question, but I hope that a resounding  yes  will be the reply. For now, what we do have is a show about science airing on FOX during Sunday primetime. That s pretty awesome.
So, the first episode of  Cosmo: A Spacetime Odyssey  is a forty-minute long ode to the original, with some updated information and sort of obvious subtraction of Carl s ominous warnings, like  The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars .
The environmentalism and anti-war messages are downplayed, but as for the rest, it s pretty much idea for idea the first episode of the original  Cosmos ,  The Cosmos and Our Place in It , because it s basically about the cosmos  and guess what  our place in it.
Now, if you ve been on social media at all during the airing of this episode, you ll find a lot of people oo-ing and awing about how small and insignificant we are, and I guess with state-of-the-art graphics that makes it even more evident as you consistently zoom out in HD. The calendar Sagan is so famous for showing the world, where he shows that recorded human history only happens in the last hour of the last day of the year is updated, created a breath-taking display of how young we are in comparison to the universe.
The spaceship of the imagination is also included, only this time it s rendered in such amazing graphics that I m not really sure it demands a lot of imagination from the viewer. Gone is Sagan s beige bridge, and here is a sleek ship that darts through the rings of Saturn and follows the Voyager satellite.
And finally, Carl s voice is heard throughout, adding to the nods the new  Cosmos  is giving to its ground-breaking predecessor. Bonus, a story about how Neil deGrasse Tyson met Carl Sagan, and how that changed his life, and maybe ours as well.
However, it wasn t completely a rehash of the 80s. One notable addition is the story of Giodarno Bruno, a Dominican friar who took Copernicus  theory of the Earth revolving around the sun, and expanding it by saying the sun was only one of many. It told a tale of how important imagination and critical thinking is to understanding the nature of the universe, while soothing some religious feathers by suggesting that an infinite god would live in an infinite universe. More importantly, he shed light on a little known scientific figure that proved to be right despite popular opinion. Who will be the next person who makes the next big discovery?
Well, maybe they re watching the show right now.
The episode was fun, but not really filled with new information for old fans. But then again, that s not the point. The point of the show is to bring in a new generation of future scientists, and include them in the great Cosmic dialogue. I m just glad to be a part of the ride, and I look forward to what new wonders the next episode will bring.

Tyson: Religion and Science Can Be Compatible, Just Don t  Use the Bible as a Textbook 
by Josh Feldman | 6:23 pm, March 10th, 2014
 
Cosmos host Neil DeGrasse Tyson is a scientist, not a devout atheist, and he has no problem with people subscribing to whatever religion they believe in. But as an educator, he has a big problem when religious activists attempt to insert their beliefs into science education as if it s an equally valid theory. He said,  The issue there is not religion versus non-religion or religion versus science, the issue there is ideas that are different versus dogma. 
Brian Lehrer asked Tyson in the radio interview if religion and science are compatible. Tyson said there are plenty of scientists who believe in God, and in that sense they are, but not if religion starts meddling in science.
 If you start using your scripture, your religious text as a source of your science, that s where you run into problems, and there is no example of someone reading their scripture and saying  I have a prediction about the world that no one knows yet because this gave me insight.' 
He added,  Enlightened religious people know this, and don t try to use the Bible as a textbook.

Cosmos Recaps & Reviews Mar 10, 2014 Matt Tucker
It s been ages since I ve seen the original PBS version of Cosmos (heretofore to be distinguished by the latter part of its full title,...
It s been ages since I ve seen the original PBS version of Cosmos (heretofore to be distinguished by the latter part of its full title, Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, when applicable), and I m less familiar with it than I d remembered while encountering the first episode of FOX s fancy new Cosmos (consequently heretofore to be referred to by the latter part of its official title Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, also when applicable). In a fashion, that s a good thing, as it provided the opportunity for a fresh approach to the new presentation. Eventually revisiting the prior work would be welcome to see how well they both convey what is ultimately similar material.
A Spacetime Odyssey is an intriguing proposition. With FOX s immense resources, they ve spared no expense at bringing this engaging introduction and exploration into the science of life amongst the universe to, well, life. It s clear that such an update is entirely relevant when trying to reach an audience that has continually been wowed to expectation by the Hollywood machine. At the same time, it will be interesting to see if audiences, particularly young demographics, respond and turn out to take advantage of this unique use of primetime airspace.
One of the more surprising facets of this production is that Seth MacFarlane   he of Family Guy fame   is the driving force behind it. He not only invested his own money in the project but was influential in getting FOX on-board and providing the bulk of the funding. MacFarlane was concerned that less focus on space travel and exploration in modern times was a result of what he called  our culture of lethargy,  and that thought behind this project is to once again spark the imagination and interest in what s out there for newer generations.
MacFarlane became friends with writer Ann Druyan, wife of the late Carl Sagan, the brain behind A Personal Voyage, and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, a mentee and devotee of Sagan s. They ve tried for years to launch an update and follow-on to Sagan s seminal series, and make no mistake, the two are the scientific, creative, and educational hearts and minds behind the revival. Their care and devotion to Sagan s work and science in general is evident in every moment of the first hour of this thirteen-part series event. Tyson, who has gained his own popular following and serves as both the face and the voice of A Spacetime Odyssey, recounted how he was introduced to Sagan at 17 years old, solidifying his desires to pursue science as a career, but also modeling how open and communicative of a person to be, particularly in gifting the knowledge of science to those who haven t devoted their lives to it.
Tyson proves a warm and enchanting host, never too wild as to be shrill and push people away, but also not dispassionate or cold as to bore or isolate the audience. He fundamentally understands that as academic as the material needs to be, it also has to be entertaining. Using the kitschy yet cool framing device of being on a ship that allows him to traverse the vast expanse of the observed universe, as well as gives him the ability to view through the extensive reach of time both backwards through the past and into the future, Tyson is able to engage new generations in the best possible way. It s a visual shorthand that offers the appropriate lens through which to keep them interested. (Yes, by all means, it should be noted that this  Spaceship of the Imagination  is firmly rooted in the original series, which used the same device to attract and interact with its audience.)
The question is will it keep new audiences interested. And, for as media-focused as our young have become, is network television the best outlet? It s certainly more prominent than public television would offer in this day and age, even with all the focus on shows as wildly popular as Downton Abbey, Doctor Who, and Sherlock. (Though, to be fair, one has to wonder if most are catching those shows on BBC America instead of PBS.) In a generation starting to get used to getting bite-sized educational information, specifically through new media, are we at the point where a television miniseries event is going to provide the same impact as the original? Certainly, involving a second screen app on mobile devices to delve further into the information presented in each episode is a shrewd model and practice. And, if anything, this is the type of series that will likely be made available for use in classrooms to tie into specific lesson plans, perhaps allowing for even greater modern ways to communicate the included information.
These are fascinating questions raised by the creation and airing of this series. Educational television is hardly anything new   in fact, FOX is re-airing episodes on its distinctly appropriate National Geographic Channel   but employing mainstream educational programming portends good things for the future, especially if this does well in the ratings. It s also exciting to see network television branch out and try new models and new approaches to their programming. For that alone, this endeavor should be celebrated.
Beyond all of those externalities, this first episode draws one in throughout the hour. It starts right from the beginning with the Big Bang, describing in brisk, fantastic detail how our Sun, the Earth, and our moon came to be formed. Tyson presents us with Sagan s  Cosmic Calendar,  which uses the familiar construct of our annual calendar to present the known entirety of cosmic time in a digestible and relatable context. It still proves a powerful metaphor. To see the extent of our human history relegated to mere  seconds  of the  cosmic year  is both humbling and awing.
Further captivating was the zooming out through the various layers of the universe to really identify just where we are in the cosmic soup. For better or for worse, it reminded me of the navigation system of the Mass Effect video game series, which was obviously trying to ape true cosmology as much as possible, and was always a personal favorite element of those games. It wasn t surprising to see the scope, but it said much for the presentation that it kept the viewer engrossed as the Spaceship flew further out. A few notable moments: The still-saddening recognition of Pluto as just one of many planetoid structures laying amidst and beyond the belt past Neptune. (Tyson is popularly cited with starting the movement to  demote  Pluto from planetary status, which the IAU agreed with in 2006.) And the recognition of the theory of multiple universes.
With the series being fundamentally science-based, it s not hard to see how those of religious faith and belief could possibly be turned off to the material. Yet, Tyson and Druyan don t necessarily shy away from religions of the world and the obvious connection to the creation of life. In some instances, including an extended animated sequence recounting the story of Giordano Bruno, they touch on the role religious institutions played in science, but more specifically the availability of education, during the early formation of what s come to be known as Copernican cosmology.
It is unfortunate yet historical that churches have, at various times and for myriad reasons, withheld education and writing from the masses. In the case of Bruno, who actually wasn t a scientist and based his beliefs of an ever-expanding universe made of multiple stars and solar systems on visions and the reading of certain books considered apocryphal, he was tossed out of the church and eventually burned for daring to espouse his beliefs. Sadly, Galileo would prove him right just a scant decade after his death. Some might consider this science trying to blackeye religion, yet it s honestly addressed historically rather than with any sort of bias.
Furthermore, they manage to namecheck Jesus, Mohammed, and Buddha without scientific comment during the discussion of our human history. One wouldn t expect Tyson to start quoting scripture throughout this series, but they aren t attempting to get into the ages-old science vs. faith debate.
Behind the deft writing of Druyan and Steven Soter and the adept direction of Brannon Braga, he of Star Trek franchise fame, this first episode is a wondrous jaunt through the basics of our universe. Some may describe it as nothing more than a glorified planetarium exhibit, and yet there is really very little wrong with that. Through state-of-the-art visuals and a compelling score by heavyweight composer Alan Silvestri, it s a sweeping and sense-engaging installment that instills the appropriate excitement for the entire endeavor.
It s safe to say that, while I was intrigued by the premise; fondly recalled the excitement, if not the particulars, of the original series; and was impressed by the gumption to do this series event in regular season primetime network television, I hadn t expected to be as nigh-inspired by the hour as I was. Science has always been an interest, particularly the cosmos, but never to the level that fired a dedicated pursuit into the field. That makes programs like A Spacetime Odyssey a treasure and astonishing journey to spark those latent passions, if only for those moments.
Yet, that spark was greater than anticipated, inspiring in personal pursuits beyond those secondary or tertiary interests. That speaks to the power of the series, and a desire to see more of it. I m left wondering how many others were so inspired.

FYI
 Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,  hosted by Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, began its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.
LOS ANGELES (AP)   Astronomer Carl Sagan become Mr. Science for a generation after his 1980 series,  Cosmos,  took audiences on a groundbreaking TV journey through the universe.
Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, host of  Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey,  the 21st-century edition, which debuted Sunday on Fox, has a head start with a Twitter following of 1.7 million that s just edged by the starry likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and Cee Lo Green.
Tyson, a go-to expert for news reports on Earth-threatening asteroids and other science developments, said his public profile frees him from comparisons to Sagan. The educator and author with a gift for conveying the wonder of discovery died in 1996 at age 62.
 If I didn t have a following, I think people would say,  How is he going to fill Carl Sagan s shoes? How is he going to pronounce billion?   said Tyson, referring to the  billions and billions of stars  phrase made famous by Sagan in  Cosmos  (although purists insist Sagan said  upon,  not  and ).
Advertisement
Sagan was the presenter for the first series, Tyson said, and he s the presenter for the second. He gamely accepts an analogy, one he s clearly heard before, to the string of actors who have starred in the  Doctor Who  title role.
Each contributes something different, but  you re still with the franchise at the end of the day,  he said.
The new version began its 13-episode run at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday on Fox and other Fox Networks Group channels including National Geographic, FX and Nat Geo Mundo. Viewers have a second chance to catch each episode at 10 p.m. Monday on National Geographic, with added behind-the-scenes and other bonus footage. It will air in other countries on Fox channels and National Geographic Channels International.
Tyson, 55, brings to the program his distinguished credentials as director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and an author whose works include  Space Chronicles  and  The Pluto Files. 
He s the perfect modern media scientist: tall and good-looking, with a deep voice that he uses to charismatic and authoritative effect.
Proving he s a stickler for accuracy, Tyson took  Gravity  to task for scientific gaffes and prompted a flurry of coverage ranging from Hollywood trade papers to geek-favored websites. Among the more lighthearted of his  Mysteries of #Gravity  tweets:  Why Bullock s hair, in otherwise convincing zero-G scenes, did not float freely on her head. 
He is also one of the nation s most prominent African-American scientists, but says ethnicity isn t in the forefront of his perspective.
 I ve never divided my audience that way. My audience is, are you curious about the universe or not?  Tyson said. The father of two also rejects the idea of inspiring anyone to follow his career path because he is black.
 I don t go around saying I m going to be somebody s role model. In fact, I think the concept of  role model  is overrated and should be rethought,  he said. His argument: If it had taken a black astrophysicist to have been raised in Bronx, N.Y., as Tyson was, for him to become one, it wouldn t have happened.
 Role models limit what it is you might want to be when you grow up, because you re only allowed to do what others have done who have come before you,  Tyson said.  And no one should ever be limited in their imagination. 
His involvement in  Cosmos  brings him to a different and bigger stage. It gives him the chance to increase his profile with a new crowd, including the viewers who tune in to Fox for  Family Guy  laughs in the half-hour preceding  Cosmos  on Sunday and suddenly find themselves lost in space.
It was Seth MacFarlane, the comic mind behind  Family Guy  and other projects including Fox s  American Dad!  and the movie  Ted,  who got the network involved in the project. MacFarlane, a fan of the original  Cosmos,  also turns out to be a Tyson admirer. The two met through a group that connects people in science and entertainment for the exchange of ideas.
MacFarlane told reporters in January that he  wanted to sit down and ask him (Tyson) a whole bunch of nerd questions, and so I asked if he wanted to have lunch, and astonishingly he said  yes.  
They became collaborators on  Cosmos,  with MacFarlane an executive producer. The project has the look of a costly sci-fi film, reflecting what Tyson called a budget  commensurate  with its scope as well as the participation of top entertainment industry talent such as Bill Pope, director of photography on  Matrix  and  Spider-Man  movies.
Patrick Stewart, Richard Gere, Kirsten Dunst and other actors give voice to the scientists whose achievements are part of  Cosmos. 
Adding to its pedigree: Sagan s widow, Ann Druyan, who wrote the original series with Sagan and Steven Soter and who joined again with Soter to craft the second.
She s also an executive producer on the series, which she said avoids duplicating its predecessor aside from a few elements, such as the Ship of the Imagination and the Cosmic Calendar, and the audacity of its vision.
 Yes, it s the same in that intersection of emotion and solid science and fabulous facts and animation and drama and history,  she told a news conference.  But it s completely new. 
For Tyson, the series is a means to connect viewers to the  awe and wonder  of the universe and the role of science in helping them  become a better shepherd of this world. 
 We have huge issues confronting us in civilization today, in energy and transportation and health and asteroid risks and viruses, and all of these require scientific insights to address,  he said.

Neil deGrasse Tyson:  Enlightened religious people don t try to use the Bible as a textbook 
The astrophysicist spoke on "Cosmos," quantum physics and the trouble with using scripture as a scientific source

The series will explore how we discovered the laws of nature and found our coordinates in space and time.  (AP Photo/Fox, Patrick Eccelsine) (Credit: AP)
Neil deGrasse Tyson had some straightforward words about using the Bible as a scientific source. Specifically in terms of the Earth being created before the sun, as in Genesis, Tyson said,  None of that is consistent with any scientifically derived information about the world.  He continued,  So enlightened religious people know this, and don t try to use the Bible as a textbook, using a Western example. 
Tyson made the comments during an interview this morning on WNYC s  Brian Lehrer Show .  In a segment called  Ask and Astrophysicist,  the man who rebooted Carl Sagan s   Cosmos   answered questions from Lehrer and New York City residents about everything under (and beyond) the sun.
Intermingled between discussions of  Cosmos,  which premiered last night, and quantum physics, Lehrer asked Tyson about religion versus science:
 So the first episode of  Cosmos  told the story, among other things, of a 16th century Italian monk Giordano Bruno who publicly thought, or said that he thought the universe was infinite. And he was dismissed and eventually excommunicated and killed by the Catholic Church. Did you bring that into the show because you see any scary parallels between science and religion today? 
Tyson responded with an initial guffaw, and responded that two others wrote the show. But on the subject of Giordano Bruno, Tyson said,  His god, as he conceived it, was bigger than the god expressed literally in scripture or as interpreted by the cardinals of the [Catholic] Church of the day. 
 The issue there is not religion versus non-religion, or religion versus science,  Tyson said.  The issue is ideas that are different versus dogma.  (All categories of dogma from religious to political.)
Lehrer then wondered if ideas and dogma are compatible today. Neil deGrasse Tyson said that around one-third of  Western/American scientists claim that there is a god to whom they pray  and they re  fully functioning  scientists. Tyson points out that the problem is using your scripture as a scientific source. As the astrophysicist put it:
 There is no example of someone reading their scripture and saying,  I have a prediction about the world that no one knows yet, because this gave me insight. Let s go test that prediction,  and have the prediction be correct. 
He also stated that there is an issue of teaching scripture-based science in schools and said there s no history of scientists or  even atheists  harping on Sunday schools to have them teach scientific views. The entire interview is worth listening to especially if you, like Neil deGrasse Tyson, believe that  everyone should have their mind blown once a day.

Barack Obama: Special Message On "Cosmos" Debut
03.10.2014
Science
Share this Post
For the fans of Carl Sagan's Cosmos series, you might just be pleasantly surprised that the series is back with a 'big bang', not to mention updates on all of the new discoveries in the universe.
As if the debut on Sunday night wasn't exciting enough, there was a pretty special surprise guest: President Barack Obama, who introduced the episode with a special message that urged viewers to explore new frontiers, like space!
All politics aside, it was awe inspiring to have Obama as the opening act of such a spectacular event. The president's introduction  invites a new generation to embrace the spirit of discovery and inspires viewers to explore new frontiers and imagine limitless possibilities for the future,  according to a statement issued by Fox.
The new Fox science series Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey premiered on Sunday March 9th, and begins a 13-part journey through the universe and beyond, airing on 10 networks, led by Fox and National Geographic Channel.
With the brilliant scientist, astrophysicist and educator, Neil deGrasse Tyson hosting the series, it should be full of surprises.
I want to fall to my knees and weep tears of joy for how beautiful and mind blowing #Cosmos is done. Bravo @neiltyson bravo. #CosmosPremiere

Robert Lloyd writes in his review for The Times, headlined: Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' a fascinating, fun place to be:
 The subject   everything that is and how it got that way   is obviously a big one, encompassing not only planets and stars and amoebas and people, but the lenses through which we've viewed it all. Most important, it celebrates scientific inquiry itself, which Tyson defines as 'generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules: test ideas by experiment and observation; build on those ideas that pass the test; reject the ones that fail; follow the evidence wherever it leads; and question everything."
The series is presented to generate interest in science and the universe, with an interesting and fun introduction.
"The goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet. It involves presenting science in ways that connect to you, so Cosmos can influence you not only intellectually but emotionally, with a celebration of wonder and awe," says Tyson. "Science should be part of everybody's life. The prerequisite is not that you become a scientist. It's that at the end of the series, you will embrace science and recognize its role in who and what you are."
The Fox and National Geographic preview hosted at the White House on Feb 28, signaled the start of the White House Student Film Festival, and tied in with Obama's efforts to boost the use of technology and science in classrooms around the country.
Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey will air Sundays at 9 pm on Fox and Mondays at 10 pm on the National Geographic Channel with bonus footage and behind-the-scenes content.
Amazingly, the series will also be shown on 220 channels in 181 countries, and is a group effort from Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane s Fuzzy Door Productions and Cosmos Studios , the company founded in 2000 by Ann Druyan, Carl Sagan s widow.

Even the president of the United States is into the new "Cosmos."
President Barack Obama introduced the new TV series "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey" last night (March 9) during the FOX premiere of the new show, a reboot of Carl Sagan's original "Cosmos" series.
"America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dream bigger and reach farther than others imagine," Obama said during his introduction. "That's the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original ' Cosmos .' Today, we're doing everything we can to bring that same sense of possibility to a new generation because there are new frontiers to explore and we need Americans eager to explore them. There are no limits. So, open your eyes, and open your imagination. [ Carl Sagan's Astronomical Legacy in Photos ]

The first episode of "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey" kicked off the 13-episode season with a sweeping overview of the history of time as told using a "cosmic calendar." The show uses animation to bring scientific history to life. Sunday's episode paid homage to Sagan's unique brand of science education through subtle and overt references to the late astronomer's legacy. Neil deGrasse Tyson (the new host of "Cosmos") even explained that Sagan changed his life with a touching story at the end of the show about how they met.

"I already knew I wanted to be a scientist, but that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become," Tyson said of his visit to Sagan's lab at Cornell University in upstate New York. "He reached out to me and to countless others, inspiring so many of us to study, teach and do science. Science is a cooperative enterprise spanning the generations."
Tyson was just in Washington D.C. with Obama for the first ever White House student film festival. Actor and Obama Administration employee Kal Penn, TV personality and CEO of the Planetary Society Bill Nye, and Tyson hosted the film festival at the White House.
The new "Cosmos" airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Fox. You can catch a replay of the premiere today (March 10) on National Geographic at 10 p.m. ET/PT.

Neil DeGrasse Tyson To Science Deniers:  Science Is Not There For You To Cherry Pick 
CREDIT: FRANK MICELOTTA/INVISION FOR FOX/AP IMAGES
Neil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and host of National Geographic and Fox s new show Cosmos, said Sunday that he thinks the media needs to stop providing false balance in stories on scientific subjects like climate change.
Host of CNN s Reliable Sources Brian Stelter asked Tyson whether he thought the media had a responsibility portray science correctly, particularly when discussing climate change.
 The media has to sort of come out of this ethos that I think was in principle a good one, but it doesn t really apply in science,  Tyson said .  The ethos was, whatever story you give, you have to give the opposing view. And then you can be viewed as balanced. 
Stelter showed a clip of President Obama s climate speech last year, in which he decried climate deniers by saying the country didn t have time for a  meeting of the flat Earth society.  Tyson said the president s reference was a good example of how the idea of  balance  in scientific stories doesn t make sense.
 In the clip you showed of the president   you don t talk about the spherical Earth with NASA, and then say  now let s give equal time to the flat Earthers,  he said.  Plus, science is not there for you to cherry pick You can decide whether or not to believe in it but that doesn t change the reality of an emergent scientific truth. 
Tyson has spoken before about the need for the public to accept scientific facts rather than the talking points of politicians. In 2011, he said people who deny climate change exists need  to be mature enough to recognize something can be true even if you don t like the consequences of it. That s what it means to be a mature adult.  And this February, Tyson said on CNN that he hopes America doesn t wait until climate change has drastically changed the Earth s landscape to realize that our policies haven t done enough to prepare us.
 When politicians start analyzing the science, I don t know what to say at that point,  Tyson said.  Are we going to wait until the coastlines get redrawn as the glaciers melt off of Antarctica and Greenland? 
Tyson also said he hopes Cosmos, which premiered March 9, can help Americans learn how to decipher scientific facts from political spin and that it can help Americans become better stewards of the Earth.
 The goal is to convey why science matters to the person, to our society, to us as shepherds of this planet,  he said .  It involves presenting science in ways that connect to you, so Cosmos can influence you not only intellectually but emotionally, with a celebration of wonder and awe.

Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey, a reboot of Carl Sagan s popular science series, premiered last night and the numbers are not looking fantastic. Astrophysicist, and science advocate, Neil deGrasse Tyson took over hosting duties for the new series. While his deep timbre can expertly deliver the classic  billions and billions  line from the original program, with 5.8 million viewers on Fox the resulting viewership is less than stellar.
But is this really an issue at all? OK, I ll grant that Fox is a business that is interested in the Nielsen ratings. In this case though, I m not sure that subpar numbers in primetime on a Sunday night for a wildly science heavy program is a reason to call the series a failure. The worrisome thing is that people seemed interested, it was promoted heavily including a Super Bowl ad , and yet according to The Los Angeles Times the numbers didn t show up. Is Cosmos incapable of doing what it intended, and therefore a waste of time?
Not at all. Sure, a prime spot following Family Guy on Fox should have sold the show with a great lead in. But it s not exactly like Seth MacFarlane s flagship show is a mega-ratings grabber. Not only that, but many of us who are interested in Cosmos as science fans have numerous outlets to turn to for our interstellar voyage. Most Fox channels are carrying the series, including FX and FXX. Not to mention the follow up event this evening on National Geographic Channel. Add to the distribution the millions around the world who will be watching the premiere of the series as the week rolls on in their respective countries, and you notice that the viewership is fragmented. Perhaps the numbers were expected to be larger on the network broadcast, but the true overall numbers will be high enough.
Just because Fox may get all upset about the numbers, doesn t mean that producers Ann Druyan and Seth MacFarlane see what they ve made as a failure. In fact, the premiere episode is an engaging and wonderful recapturing of Sagan s spirit. Tyson is the modern Sagan, with all of the passion and charisma needed to speak on science s behalf. Cosmos is about science, and while the series premiere landed in third place in its 9pm time slot you have to remember that this is a show that is meant to be rewatched. In a world that is reliant on DVR watching for even the most average of television viewers, the potential for Cosmos to attain a similar status as the original still exists.
One final note of hope. Perhaps - and this has the scent of wishful thinking - Fox is OK with mediocre numbers because what they agreed to do is beyond making money on a series. It s possible that there s a suit somewhere in the Fox offices who believes in what Sagan created, and what is being produced now. What really matters, no matter how you spin the numbers from last night s premiere, is that a new generation will have their very own Cosmos to turn to when someone asks what could possibly be so interesting about all that empty space.

TV Ratings: Fox's 'Cosmos' Pulls 8.5 Million Viewers Across 10 Networks
"Cosmos"
The simulcast, which saw its best performance on the broadcast network, kicks off its 13-week run without a gargantuan haul.
Sunday's incredibly crowded TV schedule saw Fox pitting science against scripted heavy-hitters like The Walking Dead, True Detective and ABC's impressive launch for Resurrection.
The broadcast net's follow-up to Carl Sagan's 30-year-old Cosmos: A Personal Voyage brought in 8.5 million viewers across 10 networks -- including Fox's cable nets and the National Geographic Channel. It's a modest haul, given the scope of the launch, but Fox cited global projections north of 40 million viewers for the first week.
Among adults 18-49, Cosmos grossed a 2.9 rating.
Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, produced by Seth MacFarlane and hosted by Neil deGrasse Tyson, fared best on Fox. Fast National returns have the network earning a vast majority of the total haul with 5.8 million viewers.
As is the case with all non-live TV, expect a great deal of attention on how much of a lift Cosmos gets from time-shifters.

When I first heard that Carl Sagan s classic  Cosmos  television series from 1980 was going to be remade for a modern audience, I was skeptical. How could Neil deGrasse Tyson hope to carry on where Sagan left off? Would an over-reliance on CGI dumb down the science to such an extent that it would just be a shiny yet soulless reboot? I ve always been a huge fan of Tyson s work, but could a Cosmos 2.0 be too much for the famous science communicator to handle?
But all my reservations about the Cosmos reboot, that premiered Sunday on FOX , were completely unfounded. It was a triumph for science and once again proved that Neil deGrasse Tyson is one of the heavyweight science educators of our time. For this brilliant effort, Tyson teamed up with executive producer and  Family Guy  creator Seth MacFarlane, and Ann Druyan, who co-writer of the original  Cosmos  with her late husband, Sagan.
PHOTOS: Distant Earth: A History of  Pale Blue Dots 
In the one-hour first episode,  Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey  takes us on a dizzying journey from the Big Bang to the very edge of our observable universe; from the tiniest particles to the galactic superclusters. Tyson gives us a history lesson of the genesis of our modern understanding of the universe, starting with the oppressed 16th-Century astronomer Giordano Bruno who thought beyond the Copernican Principal, describing an  infinite  universe containing other stars, planets and even life on those other worlds.
Tragically, Bruno ran afoul of the Roman Catholic Church, which imprisoned and killed him. Bruno s story was told by Tyson through wonderful animated shorts that enhanced his awesome storytelling abilities.
From Bruno s realization about the true scale of the universe, the episode spiraled out to the Cosmic Calendar   first popularized by Sagan in the original  Cosmos    where the entirety of the history of the universe is mapped onto our 365-day year. If the Big Bang occurred on Jan. 1, the whole of human history occurred in the final few seconds of Dec. 31.

 Feeling a little small?  asks Tyson. That was the crux of this entire episode: the scale of the universe is unfathomable and our place in it is baffling, but Cosmos is here to help the audience join the dots and hopefully grasp the immensity of the questions science is asking.
Throughout the show we are treated to some of the best CGI television has to offer and, for the most part, the computer-generated renderings are scientifically sound (give or take a bit of latitude for dramatic license). Personally, I loved the beach scene where Tyson is describing how life from the oceans evolved to venture onto the land   seamlessly a CGI Tiktaalik , one of the first animals to venture out of the oceans, lumbered onto the beach and it took a moment for me to realize it wasn t real.
But deep within the spacetime fabric of this Cosmos was a beautiful emotion that had the most impact.
ANALYSIS: What s That Tiny Dot Next to Saturn? That s Earth
In the last 5 minutes, Tyson describes his personal relationship with Sagan. At 17, Tyson was invited to visit Sagan at his home in Ithaca, N.Y.   a period of his life that he remembers with great clarity. Sagan s hospitality and kindness toward him had a strong resonance at the time. Although Tyson knew he wanted to be an astronomer, he added that he also learned from Carl the kind of person he wanted to become.
Overall,  Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey  is a must-see for everyone. I think this is exactly the mainstream space science show that television has been waiting for since the original Cosmos aired over three decades ago. It links the humanity behind our urge to explore. It separates myth and religion from the scientific method, defining what the cosmos means to us and how bright a future of discovery can be. But above all, Tyson, like Sagan did in the original series, shares his deep passion for science, enthusing the viewer to learn more and question everything.
In my book, that s what makes  Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey  a winner. And do you want to know the best thing? We have another 12 episodes to go.

One of the tricky things about science is that it s always changing.
Especially when what you re trying to do with the science is put it on TV. Programs only a couple years old can be rendered out of date and practically useless by new discoveries, and the former, inaccurate way of understanding becomes of interest only to cultural historians. When we talk about the Earth being flat today, it s often as a metaphor for a closed-minded adherance to old ideas (see also: people who believe the earth is like 150 years old, or whatever the new Earth theory du jour might be). 
The thirteen episodes of the original 1980 PBS series  Cosmos  is easily some of the best science television ever brought to the small screen, and not least because Carl Sagan was such a brilliant presenter, that magical and rare brand of teacher whose enthusiasm and wonder infects everyone he reaches. It was also a comprehensive and accessible approach to a field of science most people would never have bothered to try to understand, and as such it stands as a powerful turning point in popular culture. 
Still, only six years later, enough of its material had changed to warrant a special edition employing not only new narration and information, but new computer animations. 
Such is the ephemeral nature of science television. And not all of these changes are a result of massive cultural shifts, such as the change from the early belief that the Earth centered the universe to today s far more complicated perspective. 
Keep in mind that the very first Earth-like planet orbiting within a star s habitable zone was only discovered by NASA s Kepler Space Telescope in 2011. While scientists like Sagan had certainly hypothesized the existence of other Earth-like planets somewhere out there -- after all, it seems unlikely that ours would be that much of a fluke -- we had no evidence that any existed until three years ago, which means all of the current material on life elsewhere in the universe written prior to that time would be missing a pretty remarkable piece of information. (As of today, the Kepler mission has detected 961 confirmed exoplanets since it began operations in 2009. 961!) 
Still, Cosmos has held up in spite of being out of date, because of its thoughtful, congenial, and often philosophical approach to popular science education. It even got a boost in 2009 when music project Symphony of Science made an autotuned music video on YouTube called  A Glorious Dawn  featuring Cosmos clips, which introduced the series to a generation that might never have heard of it otherwise.
When the original Cosmos first appeared on Netflix, I was ecstatic to have a chance to revisit it, but as much as I loved doing so, I wished for a new, up-to-date version that included all the new cosmological science of the past thirty years, even if it had to do so without Sagan himself, who died in 1996.
And then, in 2011, I got my wish: it was announced that a Cosmos sequel WAS in the works, put together by original co-creators Ann Druyan and Steven Soter, the ultimate Cool Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and . Seth McFarlane . Yeah. I ll admit this last threw me, but apparently it s largely due to McFarlane s influence that this new series has happened at all, and even better, that it has happened on a major network -- Fox -- rather than being relegated to Discovery Science with the rest of the television brainy crap, way up in the dusty attic of the cable channel guide where only nerds like me will go to find it. 
The new Cosmos is important for a few reasons -- it has the potential to revitalize a popular interest in science, as the original did, at a time when science funding is not particularly central on most people s radar when it comes to stuff they give a crap about (not to mention a time in which science seems to be going backward in some quarters, owing to the influence of certain religious groups threatened by the idea of an observable universe that does not include a large man in the sky directing all things). 
Also, it s simply beautiful. both to look at, and to listen to. While Carl Sagan can never be replaced, Neil deGrasse Tyson is an equally gifted traveling companion on this imaginary trip through space and time, and is just as compelling and passionate about these subjects as Sagan was, but in his own way. (I won t lie, when NGT told the story about meeting Sagan as a seventeen-year-old aspiring scientist, I WEPT A BIT. I actually cried a few times throughout, because I am emotional space weirdo.)
Expectations for this series were extraordinarily high, at least in the nerdy circles in which I tend to run, but to my surprise I felt like last night s premiere actually did recapture the grandeur and wonder of the original, a feat I would have thought impossible. The use of animation for the historical segments was also a nice touch, and the dramatic approach made what could have been very dry historical information much more broadly appealing.
Like its predecessor, the new Cosmos will comprise a total of thirteen episodes, and I'm so psyched about it that I plan on watching shows week-to-week, rather than letting the series pile up on my DVR and wasting a weekend gorging on it, as is my wont. (In fact, I was trying to remember the last time I was this excited about a network TV show, and I'm pretty sure it was Muppets Tonight, in 1996. I hope Cosmos works out better.)
But what did you think? Was the new Cosmos everything you hoped? DID YOU CRY TOO? Let s blow it up together in comments.
Cosmos airs at 9pm on Sundays on FOX, with encore showings Mondays at 10pm on the National Geographic Channel.

Neil deGrasse Tyson's 'Cosmos' premiere ratings not so stellar on Fox

To paraphrase the late Carl Sagan, billions and billions failed to show up for " Cosmos ."
A reboot of Sagan's 1980 smash science series on PBS , "Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey" premiered on Fox on Sunday, this time with outspoken astrophysicist and science educator Neil deGrasse Tyson as host and   of all people   "Family Guy" writer-producer Seth MacFarlane as executive producer along with Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan. (Sagan died in 1996.)
But despite heavy promotion and curiosity   a science documentary right after "Family Guy," how crazy is that?   "Cosmos" did not exactly deliver a big bang, with 5.8 million total viewers, according to Nielsen.
PHOTOS: WGA s top 101 shows
That amounted to third place in the 9 p.m. time slot. Instead of true science, more viewers seemed to prefer sci-fi drama, with 13.3 million tuning in to the launch of ABC's "Resurrection," about the dead returning to life. It was this season's most-watched drama premiere after CBS' "Intelligence," which had the benefit of an "NCIS" lead-in back in January.
As for "Cosmos," it premiered simultaneously on 10 networks, including Fox, National Geographic, FX and FXX. Those numbers should be available later on Monday. Given the broad distribution, plus the time-shifting capabilities of DVRs, "Cosmos" might ultimately yield a decent audience.
Time-shifiting! Science everywhere.

 Cosmos  Reboot Starts With a (Big) Bang
Article Updated: 23 Dec , 2015
by Nancy Atkinson
With much anticipation from the astronomy and science community, the opening episode of the new and updated version of Carl Sagan s  Cosmos  series premiered to the masses on television in North America last night. This reboot   this time hosted by astrophysicist Neil de Grasse Tyson   did a wonderful job of paying homage to Sagan while showcasing the grandeur of space, as well as portraying the infinitesimally small amount of time that humanity has existed. Like its original counterpart, the first episode of the series takes viewers on a quick tour of the Solar System and Universe, showing our cosmic  address  as it were, going back to the Big Bang, but also touching on multiverses and a potentially infinite Universe.
As de Grasse Tyson said at the beginning,  from the infinitesimal to the infinite; from the dawn of time to the distant future. 
There were also   seemingly   an infinite number of commercial interruptions. You can watch the episode in its entirety below, without commercials, thankfully. Watching it on television last night was disappointing because of those commercial interruptions   sometimes only a couple of minutes apart   making one wish for the PBS-commercial-free version of the original Cosmos with Sagan.
And I wasn t the only one feeling those sentiments:
What I miss most from the original 'Cosmos'? No commercials #Cosmos
  Wayne Hale (@waynehale) March 10, 2014
(Yes, I watched the show while keeping an eye on what the Twitterverse had to say about it.)
But airing the series on the Fox Network and its affiliated channels (I watched it on the National Geographic Channel) was a calculated move by the series  producer Seth MacFarlane to showcase the series and the science to a population that may not otherwise be exposed to science at this  popular  level. And clearly, science and the scientific method gets top billing in this series:
 This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers strictly adhering to a general set of rules: test ideas by experiment and observation   follow the evidence where it leads and question everything,  said Tyson.
This planetary nebula s simple, graceful appearance is thought to be due to perspective: our view from Earth looking straight into what is actually a barrel-shaped cloud of gas shrugged off by a dying central star. Hot blue gas near the energizing central star gives way to progressively cooler green and yellow gas at greater distances with the coolest red gas along the outer boundary.

With a combination of real images from telescopes and spacecraft, computer generated imagery and surprisingly watchable animations, most intriguing for me was the  cosmic calendar.  Those who have seen Sagan s original series will remember his version of the cosmic calendar as a way to conceptualize the age of the Universe, compressing 13.9 billion years down to one year. Tyson s flashier calendar also showed how January 1 would mark the Big Bang and December 31 would be the present   making each day represent about 40 million years. At this rate, humanity s entire recorded history only occupies just the last 14 seconds of the year.
But as Tyson noted, science has provided unmatched discoveries during that short span of time:  The scientific method is so powerful that in a mere four centuries, it has taken us from Galileo s  first look through the telescope to knowing our place in the Universe.

When I heard there were going to be animated sequences of historical events (the original series used actor portrayals) I was disappointed, but the animations in this series premiere surprised me by being quite engaging.
They told the story of Giordano Bruno , the 16th century Italian monk turned astronomer. He had theorized that other planets existed with other lifeforms like ours. In his 1584 book  On the Infinite Universe and Worlds,  Bruno wrote :    there is a single general space, a single vast immensity which we may freely call Void; in it are innumerable globes like this one on which we live and grow. This space we declare to be infinite  In it are an infinity of worlds of the same kind as our own. 
This was controversial for his time, but even in a church-dominated society, it wasn t grounds for being declared a heretic. But later Bruno followed his argument to its logical conclusion: if there are an infinity of worlds, and if some worlds have sentient beings created by God, then wouldn t these planets also need to be saved by God? The notion other Jesuses was not viewed well, and the church convicted him of heresy, and burned him at the stake.
Phil Plait talked more about this today in his review of  Cosmos  and I agree with him that this wasn t really about showing religion in a bad light, but about making  a bigger point about suppression of thought and the grandeur of freedom of exploration of ideas. 
Other fun moments were when a CGI (but quite realistic) dinosaur fish named a Tiktaalik crawled out of the sea right next to Tyson, depicting the evolution of life on Earth. Most endearing was perhaps Tyson s claim that  we are ALL descended from astronomers;  how our ancestors depended on the stars to know the change of seasons.
While this series premier was a quick overview, one surprise is that it showed just one theory   and the oldest and perhaps outdated   of how our Moon was formed, by a conglomeration of the same debris that make up Earth. These days it seems the theory of a Mars-sized planetary collision is the most accepted theory.
The show began and ended with the voice and words of Carl Sagan, and Tyson shared his story about his own personal interactions with Sagan. This was a very authentic part of the show, and allowed the torch to be passed from Sagan to Tyson.

And then there was Tyson using Sagan s famous  we are made star stuff  quote:
 They get so hot that the nuclei of the atoms fuse together deep within them to make the oxygen with breathe, the carbon in our muscles, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our blood,  Tyson said.  You, me, everyone: We are made of star stuff.

  Nancy Atkinson (@Nancy_A) March 10, 2014
This series premiere was a rousing tribute to science and I am definitely looking forward to more. Here s hoping this series does what MacFarlane had in mind: get the general public to start talking about science again.
If you are feeling the need for more  Cosmos  you can watch the original series at Hulu Plus, and at the Carl Sagan website, learn more about the legend.
There is   The Seth MacFarlane collection of the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan archive, 1860-2004   at the Library of Congress. MacFarlene supported this new Carl Sagan archive.

Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson s smooth voice and cool manner steered the Ship of Imagination through the known history of the cosmos and through the development of modern science in the debut episode of  Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey  on Sunday.
Reviving the immensely popular show  Cosmos: A Personal Voyage,  hosted by the late Carl Sagan, Tyson has some big shoes to fill.
Here s a look at Tyson s maiden voyage, taking the Ship of Imagination s helm and setting it on course for a 13-episode series (the Ship of Imagination was a feature of Sagan s show, adopted also in the current series). 
Episode 1, titled  Standing up in the Milky Way  begins with a promise. Tyson tells the audience he will explore everything we know from the  infinitesimal to the infinite,  taking us through universes smaller than atoms and other wonders of the cosmos.
He breaks up the known universe into various lines of our cosmic address. The solar system is one line; the Milky Way galaxy is another; the Virgo supercluster a group of about 100 billion galaxies of which ours is but one  is the last known line of our address.
Broad Perspective

The perspective in the episode continually pans out for a broader and broader perspective in which our world is a smaller and smaller speck.
Skimming over Venus, we see the  runaway greenhouse effect has turned it into a kind of hell,  says Tyson. Understanding this effect on Venus was one of Sagan s major contributions to science. Jupiter s red spot, a hurricane three times the size of Earth, provides the first comparison by which we see our planet s size diminishing in the ever-expanding view.
Beyond Voyager 1 the spacecraft that has traveled farther than any other launched from Earth and beyond the cloud of comets that encircles our solar system, we enter  the deeper waters of this vast cosmic ocean. 
Seeing What We Couldn t Before
On the subject of extraterrestrials, Tyson speaks of the possibility that life may exist outside our concept of life.  But what do we know about life?  he asked.  We ve met only one kind before Earth life. 
Our eyes have limited sight. Tyson shows that when we first started to view space in infrared, the kind of technology used in night-vision, we found way more stars and planets than we could see before.
The visuals are engaging, and even elegant in the way they flow. Tyson s descriptions are even poetic at times; he describes the rogue planets detected by infrared as  orphans cast away from their mother stars during the chaotic birth of their native star systems.

 Feeling a Little Small 
The bubble theory has its place in this episode. The screen pans out to show our universe as a bubble surrounded by many other bubbles so many, in the end, that each universe is like a droplet of water in a massive, rushing waterfall.
 Feeling a little small?  asks Tyson.  We may just be little guys living on a speck of dust afloat in a staggering immensity. 
This is where he takes us back to Earth.

Breaking Boundaries 
An animated episode tells the story of Giordano Bruno, a 16th-century friar who said the sun is simply a star like so many others. He burned at the stake for his heresy.
A thread that ran through the episode was the idea that science has been wrong before that the scientific community has been so certain of its knowledge that it would shun bold individuals who proposed different perspectives.
Will we see Tyson propose any bold or new perspectives throughout the series? Thus far, it all seems to fit fairly well within the bounds of conventional scientific understandings.
Bruno had a vision, a startlingly accurate vision of the structure of the cosmos. He was not a scientist. Tyson calls Bruno s understanding and vision a  lucky guess.  He falls short of considering Bruno s ability to accurately understand the cosmos through a spiritual vision an ability that may relate to the little-understood wonders of the human mind.

History of the Cosmos in a Scale That s Easier to Understand
File photo of a calendar . (Shutterstock)
Another historical perspective fills the second part of the cosmic saga. The history of the known universe is put in terms of a calendar year. Jan. 1 is the Big Bang, Dec. 31 is now. Every month is a billion years and every day is 40 million years.
The Big Bang is presented like a scene from an action movie, with Tyson facing the huge explosion, a silhouette with his arms heroically outstretched.
The first stars appeared on Jan. 10, our sun appeared on Aug. 31 (4.5 billion years ago), and the final 14 seconds of Dec. 31 are recorded human history.
Moses was born seven seconds ago, Buddha six seconds ago, Jesus five seconds ago, Mohammed three seconds ago, and at the very last second came the scientific method.
Tyson wrapped up the episode with thoughts of Sagan. Tyson first met Sagan in 1975. Sagan, already famous, took the time to meet with this 17-year-old from the Bronx who had aspirations of becoming a scientist. They spent a Saturday afternoon together in Ithaca, N.Y. Sagan signed a book for Tyson with the message,  For Neil, a future astronomer. 
Forty years later, Tyson has taken the torch from Sagan and continued on a mission to bring scientific exploration to a broad audience. He closed the first episode with the words,  Now, come with me, our journey is just beginning.

Nat Geo will rebroadcast the episode on Monday, March 10 at 10 p.m. ET with extra content. The next episode,  Some of the Things That Molecules Do,  will air on March 16, 2014 at 9 p.m. ET in the United States across 10 networks of 21st Century Fox.

The Single Most Mind-Altering Photograph Humanity Has Ever Taken

Tweet on Twitter
The internet is abuzz this morning after the big-budget debut of the reenvisioned Cosmos series last night, starring Neil deGrasse Tyson.
The original series aired in 1980 and was accompanies by a book of the same name. It s perhaps the most lasting work by cosmologist Carl Sagan, oft-hailed as the best communicator of scientific concepts in the 20th Century.
Sagan was born in 1934 and lived with his family in Bensonhurst. Around the time of the airing of the original series, he returned to the neighborhood for a video segment in which he reflected on his first childhood thoughts about the stars and the broader universe.
 I knew my immediate neighborhood intimately; every candy store, front stoop, backyard and wall for playing Chinese handball,  he said in the video.  It was my whole world. 
The video has some fantastic shots of 86th Street and the elevated subway in the 1980s. Sagan himself lived on Bay 37th Street, and, later, Bay Parkway. The family took frequent outings to Coney Island and  old photos show Carl lolling on the beach,  notes a biography of the famed astronomer.
The video above tells an abbreviated account of what happened next   the occasion that sparked his life long search of the cosmos. But he previously shared a more detailed account:
[The stars] seemed to me different. They just weren t like everything else.
And so I asked other kids what they were . They said things like  they re lights in the sky, kid. 
I could tell they were lights in the sky, but what were they little electric bulbs on long black wires?   I asked my parents, they didn t know. I asked friends of my parents, they didn t know.
[His mother suggested:]  I ve just gotten you your first library card. Take the streetcar to the New Utrecht branch of the New York Public Library and find a book . [The answer] has to be in a book. 
I went to the library. I asked the librarian for a book on the stars. She came back and gave me a book. I opened it. It was filled with pictures of people like Jean Harlow and Clark Gable.
I was humiliated. I gave it back to her and said,  This wasn t the kind of stars I had in mind.  She thought this was hilarious, which humiliated me further. She then went and got the right kind of book. I took it a simple kid s book. I sat down on a little chair a pint-sized chair and turned the pages until I came to the answer.
And the answer was stunning. It was that the Sun was a star but really close. The stars were suns, but so far away they were just little points of light . And while I didn t know the [inverse] square law of light propagation or anything like that, still, it was clear to me that you would have to move that Sun enormously far away, further away than Brooklyn [for the stars to appears as dots of light] .
The scale of the universe suddenly opened up to me. [It was] kind of a religious experience. [There] was a magnificence to it, a grandeur, a scale which has never left me. Never ever left me.

President Obama Introduces 'Cosmos' Premiere, Encourages Viewers to Explore 'New Frontiers' (Video)
The series debuted Sunday night across 10 Fox Networks Group channels.
President Barack Obama introduced the premiere of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey on Sunday night and took the opportunity to tout the importance of discovery and exploration.
"America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dreamed bigger and reached farther than others imagined," he said in his intro (watch it below). "That's the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original Cosmos."

Seth MacFarlane teamed with Sagan s original creative collaborators -- writer/executive producer Ann Druyan and co-writer, astronomer Steven Soter -- to conceive the new 13-part series.
In his intro, Obama goes on to encourage viewers to use their imaginations and added that there are "new frontiers to explore."
"Open your eyes, and open your imagination," he said. "The next great discovery could be yours."
The series premiered Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/PT on 10 Fox Networks Group channels, including Fox and National Geographic Channel. On Feb. 28, Fox and Nat Geo hosted a special preview of the show at the White House as part of the first White House Student Film Festival.

'Cosmos' Takes Viewers on a Journey Led by Neil deGrasse Tyson
By Michele Berger

Follow @MicheleWBerger
The long-awaited Cosmos: A Space Time Odyssey aired last night on Fox hosted by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, with an opening by President Obama. Nearly 6 million people tuned in to watch the revival of the show first created by astronomer Carl Sagan more than 30 years ago.
 America has always been a nation of fearless explorers who dream bigger and reach farther than other imagine,  Obama said, during his 30-second intro.  That s the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original Cosmos. Today we re doing everything we can to bring that same sense of possibility to a new generation. 
In that same spirit, NASA released a set of space photos to accompany the premiere and to inspire with their beauty. The photos are in the slideshow above.
As for the first episode , it didn t disappoint. Tyson took viewers on an incredible journey. Phil Plait, who writes the Bad Astronomy blog for Slate, put the experience beautifully:  It s gorgeous, both for the eyes and the brain. The special effects are wonderful and wondrous and Neil Tyson s style and voice are a good fit. This first episode is all about showing how small we are. 
In the grand scope of the universe, that s pretty tiny. If its creation were a one-year calendar, humans don t show up until the last hour of December 31, and much of our history happens within the last few seconds of the year.
The episode ends with a moving story of Tyson s initial meeting with Sagan, when the former was just a teenager from the Bronx who knew he wanted to be a scientist.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and Ann Druyen Talk Cosmos and Gravity at SXSW [Video]
Do we want to be around them or just be them? We can't decide.
by Victoria McNally | 2:12 pm, March 10th, 2014
 
Not everybody gets to be at SXSW right now, and even fewer of us get to hang out with Neil deGrasse Tyson and Cosmos producer Ann Druyen. That s why we re happy we found this set of videos from the Samsung What s Trending SXSW blogger lounge, so we can live vicariously through this lucky audience.
Above, Ann Druyen explains how the Spaceship of the Imagination is powered in equal parts by skepticism and imagination, and how the legacy of Cosmos lives on beyond the work of Carl Sagan in this new  visual experience . Below, Neil talks about his fake feud with the film Gravity, and how all his griping was actually a massive compliment.

There ae mroe but these are rather famous.
As for Science Unitign Mankind, thats not True either. Science is liek any other Human Enterprise, fraought with disagrements, many of which are very heated.
Science isnt a Unifyign force, its just another thign Humans use to Learn form and often argue over.
Alan Braganza
When I seek truth, I need to see the facts or as many facts possible. With faith, the facts may not be all there in convincing form so faith relates closer to belief.  A belief in something may not suggest that is it absolutely true without physical facts.
skwills
Beleif is anythign you think is True. Faith is Trust. Faith doesnt relate mroe closley to Beleif thsn to Truth, thats nonsenical Grammatically.
Faith, again, is not beleivign in somethign wthotu evidence. One can have Faith in somethign precicely because it has ample evidence conclusivley provign it to be so.
skwills
I am a Christain and I dont beelive in a Magical man int he sky, and iI dotn think Faith and Sicnece need to be kept separate. I do think e need to be careful in science to rpesent only what is absoluely known, but I find no real reason why Theology and Philosophy cannot incprporate the discoveries of Science.

skwills, If I could just say, just keep on doing your best; just know when to end an argument and accept disagreement. I hazard a guess that your schooling may have been a challenge and you continue to strive which you must and that will be good for you and for your success.
Now I bid you  Adieu  and I must get work done.
This is not really work but at least I advocate for rights: animal rights always and regularly but I reached this page to advocate for an early astronomer just before Galileo, a man called Bruno who was burned violently for his honest, engaging and heartfelt beliefs which opposed the Church of his time and well, they sublimated him and he is now star dust if it makes it feel better.
Indeed Adieu !
skwills
If you d bothered to read this Article you d Realsie that Bruno was not Burned at the STake for Honest and Heatfelt beleifs that happened to disagre with th Churches. He was killed because he was a Troublemaker who made too many Enemies, and who was defiant till the end. His bad pesonality contributed heavily to ehat befell him. His actual Heresies were not even his COsmology which no oen cared about.
Alan Braganza
Thanks skwills for your insights on G. Bruno and I agree that he must have disagreed enough with the very people who put him to death. I had read he was ahead of his thinking regarding other worlds like Earth and the church leaders did not want to hear that. You see at that time they believed that the Earth was the centre and the Sun went around the Earth. (Copernican) A decade later Galileo gave evidence for a sun centred universe for them so Bruno was ahead of his time. Still the people around him were skeptical and not very good. My point was that many scientist astronomers were given much opposition by the early church, the Catholic Church.
Thank you for your good and wise insight on this.
skwills
You should read this Article. Bruno was not executed over his COsmology, which is explicity stated in the article wose comment section you are now in. Also, COpernicus actually taught Heliocentrism, not Geocentrism. He also was made a Cardinal and died peacefully of a Stroke in his sleep. Ptolomy came up with Geopcentrism.
Bruno s death was mroe due to his bad Persona;ity than hsi beelifs, and ofrmally he was charged with (And guilty of) practicing Hermetic Magic, deyign the Virignity of Marry, the Divnity of CHrist, and other such matters as well as telling peopel to worhsip Egyptian gods.
Alan Braganza
Thank you. From your response and from reading above, I realize now that Bruno s heresy against the basic truths of the Roman Catholicism, mainly that Bruno denied Christ s Divinity; denied the Immaculate Conception, and denied transubstantiation had made him extremely disliked and therefore he was charged by the Roman Catholic Inquisitors and burned to death as punishment for heresy.
As he practiced magic and said animals and objects had souls which really did not fare well with people, just added to his disfavour and increased his enemies.
So he was really a bad personality even disliked by both Copernicus, (yes thanks, heliocentred universe) and by Galileo.
Well Bruno did make some bad choices in what he said although to consider animals as having souls suggest they are sentient in some way which I thought was a good consideration to have of animals just so they may be treated with humaneness and dignity not cruelty.
skwills
I m glad You are learning form this and not angry. I enjoy such talks. But unfortunately I do have a few more corrections.
For starters, Jesus was not born Via Immaculate Conception in Christianity. Mary was, in Catholic Theology. The Immaculate Conception is not the same thing as he virgin Birth. It means Mary was born without Original Sin.
Also, The Catholic Church does not have a problem with a belief that Animals have Souls. In fact, Catholicism teaches that they do have Souls. Whether or not those Souls are immortal is up for debate, but one is allowed to believe either as the Church has not ruled on it.
Alan Braganza
It is engaging to have intelligent discussion of points and far from annoyance unless someone refuses to accept sound logic and accurate facts and instead writes words that do not make meaning. I do have to admit when writing is illegible, it would strain communication but here is my response:
By your above posting comment that you have more corrections, are you suggesting I am incorrect about my re phrasing of the article s point that Bruno denied the Immaculate Conception of Christ and the virgin birth? I did see it written that he denied the virgin birth which suggests birth of Christ from the virgin Mary. I added immaculate conception because this is inferred by me. I am wondering why you are questioning my inference.
I do question the accuracy of your statement above, that,  For starters, Jesus was not born Via Immaculate Conception in Christianity. Mary was, in Catholic Theology .  Your error suggests Jesus  mother Mary was immaculately conceived when this is incorrect. It was Jesus who was conceived immaculately as the Holy Spirit graced Mary and immediately,Jesus was conceived. I would believe that Mary was born the natural way from union of both her parents whom little is mentioned.
The second error you have made is one of assumption of my understanding, in your sentence,  The Immaculate Conception is not the same thing as he virgin Birth .  Here you suggest that it is what I mean but I did not state this. I simply inferred that adding to the statement that Bruno denied the virgin birth.
As an animal advocate, I accept that our pets have a soul so this is more personal; however I am not alone in this belief.
skwills
You don t seem to understand. The Immaculate Conception is the Catholic Doctrine that says Mary was Born without Sin, and thus as a suitable vessel to carry Jesus. The Immaculate Conception is not the same thing as The Virgin Birth of Christ, it s a separate Doctrine all together. The Doctrine of The Immaculate Conception states that While Mary was not Born of a Virgin, she was born free of the Stain of Original Sin.
http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07674d.htm
Also, it should be noted that This was not defined by the Church until 1854, meaning it was not considered Heretical to reject it until then, and one could be a Catholic in Good Standing if one did not believe in The Immaculate Conception. The belief existed since Ancient Times, but was not a Dogma of the Church until the 19th Century. Protestants also reject The Immaculate Conception, and Eastern Orthodox Christians do not need it as they reject the basic concept of Original Sin all together.
I agree with you on Animals and feel that Humans tend to think only of themselves and are an arrogant species.
Alan Braganza
skwills,  I recognize my misconception of the two Doctrines.  While accepting both the Immaculate Conception and the Virgin Birth my memory of the terms from my high school religious studies class is at best a little vague now several decades later as unless a concept of religion or of science is made with good foundation, a fertile learning mind may not comprehend fully and effectively for retention and recital later.
I now accept my errors in thinking that immaculate conception was Jesus  conception when it really correctly relates to Mary s conception in her mother s womb, excluded from original sin.
Reading from the definition at Wikipedia, sets me straight about the Virgin Birth which I can reiterate relates to Jesus being conceived through the Holy Spirit in Mary s womb, while she remained a virgin.
I will respond further later. Thanks.
skwills
No wirries. Thanks for the polite conversation.
Alan Braganza
Thank you for your insights.
I appreciate this discussion and respect differences in opinions as I like to keep my learning open and open for new wisdoms.
Alan Braganza
The poor Giordano Bruno  dared to think differently and actually challenged accepted thinking of his time and when questioned about it especially regarding the very tenets of Catholic faith, he still did not recant and so they, the Roman Inquisitors tried him in court for seven years.
The authoritarian Catholic Church of his time did excommunicate him and Bruno was persecuted for his open minded beliefs amid a traditional and suppressive church unwilling to accept new and forward thinking notions.
I do not recommend people to adopt Bruno s belief s but to recognize that Bruno was a remarkable free thinking intellectual and made extraordinary connections among some of the stuff and crusty authoritarians who were accustomed to blind obedience. The closed mindedness of the institutions refused to accept Bruno s remarkable thinking so they felt justified when he refused to recant his doubts, to burn him at the stake which was cruel and typical closed mindedness of the church at that time.
Bruno s philosophical thinking influenced thinking for centuries after and this is why I think Bruno s life was tragic.
skwills
Bruno 2was not Ipen Minded. Bruno insulted anyone who disageed with him. He was far mroe Authoritarian and Dictatorial than the Catholic Churc, which took 14 Years ot bother with a Trial for him. Bruno s execution was liekly more the result of his own rotten personality and the sheer number of peopel whom he had attacked decidign to put an end to him, ratyher than just his beleifs.
AGain, read this artucle. The CHurch was not really all that CLosed Minded.
Alan Braganza
There were many so called intense personalities of genius and near genius in antiquity and Bruno was thinking beyond his years irrespective of whether he was liked or disliked. Sir Isaac Newton was a difficult personality also and he ranks among the greatest contributors in science and mathematics in human history. Bruno was the first to have made some fascinating statements about other worlds and so Bruno was quite ahead of his time in that matter.
Please read this very good reference which comments in discussion on this very issue of Discover written by Author, Corey S. Powell with Cosmos co-writer Steve Soter about Brunos inclusion in Cosmos. ( http://www.ciclops.org/news/making_sense.php?id=7862&js=1 )   Bruno passionately described at that time so very long ago before Galileo Galilei what understood to be the fundamental difference between stars and planets and so Bruno elaborated upon Copernican thought and gave humanity the first understanding of the astrophysical universe never before described like that.
It is exactly for Giordano Brunos contributions to helping both understandings in science and in philosophy that all science and astronomy must acknowledge him even if the church may choose not to for the reasons already substantiated.
It s noteworthy and significant observation by one person who had tremendous struggle in his life. May he be acknowledged, even if not recognized a hero because of it all.

Cosmos is written by Men who have a clear Agenda besides just teachgn Science. Much liek the original Cosmos, theypromote the same Humanism of Carl Sagan, who was also the Master of Tyson when he was in School.
The Real Reason Brunio was included was the same Reason as the Christians killign ypatia because she was three thigns the Chruch cdl dtnd, a Oagan, a Woman,a nd an Intellectual in the original Cosmos. It wa sincluded to ropogate he idea of Christianity holding back Science and Reason. And liek Hypatia, this new Cosmos got Bruno s story wrong.
Bruno wasn t killed over his Cosmology, and his personality was not merley difficult but outright combative.
He also never relaly contibuted to the development of modern Science or our understndign of the Univere. Yiy won t find any serious Historians of Science sayign h e advanced our understaning. he was just an occultic figue who happeend to be made into a Hero in the 19th Century becaue his sotry coudl be used as propaganda to attack Christedom with base don the newly mnted myth of Science and Relgiion beign in conlict.
Alan Braganza
There is evidence to the claim that Christianity or the religious leaders of that time held scientists, science and reason in scrutiny and constrained free thinking and comfortable scientific progress in those times.  The Church were the authorities of learning and opposed any challenge to their accepted views during the Christian Dark Ages before the Renaissance.    Turn our thoughts, in the next place, to the characters of learned men. The priesthood have, in all ancient nations, nearly monopolized learning. Read over again all the accounts we have of Hindoos, Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Teutons, we shall find that priests had all the knowledge, and really governed all mankind. Examine Mahometanism, trace Christianity from its first promulgation; knowledge has been almost exclusively confined to the clergy. And, even since the Reformation, when or where has existed a Protestant or dissenting sect who would tolerate a free inquiry? The blackest billingsgate, the most ungentlemanly insolence, the most yahooish brutality is patiently endured, countenanced, propagated, and applauded. But touch a solemn truth in collision with a dogma of a sect, though capable of the clearest proof, and you will soon find you have disturbed a nest, and the hornets will swarm about your legs and hands, and fly into your face and eyes.     [Letters to John Taylor, 1814, XVIII, p. 484] 
      John  Adams,     The Letters of John and Abigail Adams
 Nicholas de Cusa (1401-1464), an ecclesiastical reformer, administrator and cardinal, was also a great influence on Bruno. The idea of evolution appears in Nicholas de Cusa in a somewhat pantheistic form, but is further developed by Giordano Bruno with greater clarity both for physics and metaphysics. Giordano Bruno s unitary concept of nature found admiration by very important philosophers/scholars such as, Baruch de Spinoza, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi and George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. While his overall contribution to the birth of modern science is still open to debate, many believe Giordano Bruno to be much more a philosopher than a scientist. Issac Asimov disregards him as a  philosopher and poet  rather than a scientist, though he sees scientists as dreamers. Scholars such as Frances Yates believe his ideas on an infinite universe without geocentric structure were a critical shift between the old and new modes of thought. Bruno s concept of multiple worlds is also viewed by some as a forerunner to Everett s many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Some also believe Giordano Bruno was one of the precursors to Sir Isaac Newton s theory of place and absolute space.

John Adams was not a Historian,and simply because he wrote a letter doesn t mean anything to me at all. In fact, it always baffled me why people who say we shouldn t just quote the Bible as if its an unquestionable Authority and how we should critically evaluate its claims because its foolish to just Blindly believe in things because they were written down would then turn around and blindly accept the word of some famous guy they respect, be it Carl Sagan, Aldois Huxley, or in this case, John Adams. Other than being an American Founding Father, what really makes John Adams important  here? Why does being an American Founding Father even matter. John Adams was wrong. Priesthoods did not hold back Knowledge all the Time in every Culture. In fact, the Priesthoods in various Cultures often acted as the only orginised group of people actually Teaching people things.
As for the  Evidence  that Christianity has held Science back and that they tries to suppress Free Thinking and looked with disdain over Scientific Developments or Critical Thought, you haven t shown such evidence, you just made an assertion. Worse still, Jon Adams letter to Abigail Adams wasn t even saying this, he was critical of Orginised Priesthoods, not of Religion in and of itself. John Adams was a Congregationalist, and the Congregationalist Church had no Priesthood. Adams was saying that he did not like Priesthood, not that he didn t like Religion.
There was no such thing as The Christian Dark Ages. In fact, there was no such thing as The Dark Ages period. The Medieval World was not The Dark Ages. The term  Dark Ages  is no longer used by Historians, and the Concept most people have of the Thousand Year period as a Time of Stagnation and oppression is purely  Fictitious, as The Middle Ages was in fact a Time of relative peace and stability, and actually did see both Technological Advancement and development of Philosophical Ideas. Anyone who speaks of The Dark Ages is simply ignorant of the Realities of the Middle Ages, and anyone who thinks its The Christian Dark Ages as if Christianity is somehow responsible for the nonexistent stagnation is simply being duped by a Myth created as a polemic against Christianity.
Historians like  Regine Pernoud or Morris Bishop have debunked the idea of the Middle Ages as a Time of brutality, oppression, and Anti-Intellectualism. You can even look this up for Free on the Internet, just visit the Encyclopedia Britannica, or heck even Wikipedia, and you will find that The Dark Ages is a Myth that isn t taken seriously by actual contemporary Historians.
Bruno was not that influential and remains someone who was contentious in his Lifetime and who suffered more because of his own arrogance than any sort of control over Thought at the Time.

If you do not keep Faith and Science separate then you may get Creationism which is Fundamentalist and states Earth is some 6000 years old.
Tell me about the Native populations of North America 11000 to 12000 years ago that lived and existed in harmony with Nature and were religious and respectful to the Earth. This was North America before white Europeans and it was called Earth but Judaism, Christianity and Islam were non existent and not even planned for.

So please bare with me.
Jerry D. Albert from California, writes about four reasons why special creationism should be rejected,  its dangers to personal, biblical Christian faith, and its role as a pseudo-scientific threat to science education  in The Dangers of  Special Creationism  to Christian Faith.
We aren t talking about Creationism. We re discussing Giordano Bruno and the wider implications of how men like Neil DeGrasse Tyson actively promote a false vie of History in the context of Science VS Religion.
With that said, I am not a Creationist, but I really don t think Creationism harms people. It just comes off as silly to me to think it does. How is this any different from someone like Ken Ham saying belief in Evolution harms society as well as Biblical Faith? To me, it just seems like people want to depict something they disagree with as dangerous rather than simply disagreeing with it.
If closed mindedness is a detriment to both religious enlightenment and to creative objective scientific reasoning, then an appreciation that open not constrained thinking needs to be the way to gain harmony without dissent and rebellion.
But isn t telling people that Creationism is a danger to society itself just closed minded?
Paul Davies writes that,  As we enter a new century likely to be dominated by sweeping scientific and technological developments, the need for spiritual guidance will be stronger than ever.

ANd I should care about Paul Davies opinion regarding Science and Religion in this discussion why, exactly?

This is Pure Garbage. As someone who actually has a degree in Theology, and who understands the Academic rigour that is involved in getting said degree, I can assure you that, while Theologians are not Scientists, Modern Scientific Discoveries are openly discussed, and often incorporated into, he Thinking of Modern Theologians. Many Churches even run Scientific Institutions that help advance Science, and many Theologians are also Scientists.
This claim is just wrong.
  many cases exist in which religious and scientific perspectives present no conflict at all. Thousands of scientists busily carry out their research while maintaining personal spiritual beliefs, and an even larger number of everyday folks fruitfully view the natural world through an evidence-based, scientific lens and the supernatural world through a spiritual lens. Accepting a scientific worldview needn t require giving up religious faith.  
OK and some people don t think there is a  Supernatural World  that has to be seen Spiritually as opposed to a Natural one that has to be viewed Scientifically, yet still hold to the idea of Gods existence.
Which means nothing in this discussion.
Regarding the infamous Bruno, he really was a very unsavory character for he made the gravest mistakes being a man of Christian faith, denouncing key doctrines of Catholicism and showing no remorse or recanting even when tried in court for a number of years. He undoubtedly will be remembered as such and also that he thought differently in his cosmic views of the heavens.
But he should not be remembered as a Martyr for Science as he was not only not a Scientist, but his Cosmological Ideas were not influential and he wasn t killed for them.

John Adams was a hot tempers man who committed Treason against the Crown. I m not very impressed by his opinions.
Alan Braganza
Thank you for your views. When disagreements regarding conflicting ideologies are made such as with Creationism and that statement that Creationism is dangerous, I can only compare it to why certain ideological beliefs not generally accepted may be given that same critical thought. Perhaps the author Jerry D. Albert has his strong convictions as he wrote but more serious are the current ideologies followed by Islamic radicals that do not embody any doctrines of the Islamic faith. Enough said on those points as this debate on religion may extend indefinitely.
Paul Davies, a scientist was making his opinion on those facts which are valid and  true to fact because as science continues to explain the universe with better theories, our very existence is better understood. Religion exists with all its core doctrines with science s pace and any controversial assertions by some religions will need to be abandoned when science explains such with improved evidence (creationism vs fossil record evidence) that the majority of people would embrace. By the same logic and valid argument, if Jesus were to return in His Divine glory for Judgement and announce it as such just before the end of the world, I really think that all the most skeptical scientists would need to be listening.
Regarding the selection of Giordano Bruno by Cosmos and to make their point was probably not helping the science vs religion debate; however, Neil de Grasse Tyson said what he needed to say whether he wrote the script to include Bruno or not. It appears to me that Cosmos will pick characters to raise their ratings whether controversial or not. In this case, it spurned debate and so much on this blog. Hopefully this will allow better documentary programming and more objective science shows.
I did not particularly favor that episode more than others. I rather prefer to have instances when the people featured happen to be both scientists and religious because it shows the duality of ideological being where there is balance between the two.
There is and will always be the need for understanding between people of science and people of religion regarding mutual respect and their ideologies just as science documentary producers have an obligation to accurately state facts and be objective. They owe it to the viewer.
Wish you well, skwills.

David,
Despite your clever language ( created by  vs  exists due to ), why is this a fact that can t be proven?  In what way does the creation/existence of a universe escape the ability of logical evidence?
Thanks,
Scott
David
Scott  There is a realm of theological thought that God created the universe and all of it s rules; and then left it to run its own course. I have seen this described as  deism  but I am not fully versed in their beliefs, so I m not sure if that s absolutely what I believe.
I am a software developer, and I think my beliefs can best be summed up as saying that I see God as one who created a vast simulation of physics, and allowed that simulation to run its course with minimal interaction. He is still a  creator  in that sense of belief, but not in the sense that he created the universe solely for mankind through the process described in Genesis.
I ve told this to others and they said what I believe is intelligent design; but I reject that also as people who believe in intelligent design still believe that God did it all for us. He did not.
So what about the bible, and Jesus, and the prophets, etc? I think the books of the Old Testament were written in a time of great chaos and barbarism; and were associated with God to give them authority, when their real purpose was to be used as a series of laws, written by man. If you notice, most of the dogma and so-called  hatred  you see from the church now originates from the laws of the Old Testament.
The New Testament was written after a time of religious rule, by people who believed that the laws of the Old Testament had been subjugated in order to set up a religious caste of rulers, and they were slowly rejecting that idea. Again, what better way to get people to agree with you than the base your books on a great leader, a King, who was prophesied from the very laws that they current followed?

Well, hre I m provign I m an idio to you again by pointign out that your wrong.
You didn t quote Genesis 1:26 or 1:18, youjust referenced them. I will quote them. Before I do though, I d like to note that neither of thsoe verses actually say the World was Created for Man.
Read what I ve said, and this Time, dnt;  just say  Yoru worng, ti does mean he mae the world for Man  and act liek thats that. It never ocne actually says this.
26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. 27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
Tes it says Man has DOminion over the Earth. However, Dominion simply means Man Governs, or Rules. To assume this means Man is the Reason for the Earth beign Created from this is however unjustified. I knwo you want to make that assumption and won t be able to swallow your pride and admit you were wrogn and will call me an idiot or say I m twistign thigns but, the term  DOminion  does nto mean  You are the prupose for this thing . This is liek sayign a Kigndom exists for the King, or that Staes in AMerica exist for Governors.
Man beign given Dominion over the Earth is not evidcence that God s sole purpose in Creatignt he world was Man, it only means God left Man in CHarge of the Earth,. The two are distinct.

Actually, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have a God concept where by God is authoritarian, angry and ever punishing to instill fear in followers and to be forgiving in their controlled masses. Yet tremendous carnage and modern day wars have resulted because of these top three religions of humankind. Not very honourable or good, indeed!
While the Amish, the Jains and the Buddhists are more gentler with healthy reverence to regard animals highly and to protect nature. Very honourable and good indeed!

Alan Braganza , Thank You for confirmign that yiu re just here to bash the Abrahamic Faiths, mainly Chriatianity.
mean, coem on, this is a Howler.. Someone said that acordign to the Bible all of Creation, or at least theEarth was made for man and this is said Several Times, and the only passage he cites that says this doens t actually say this. I pointed this out and you say the following.
Actually, Judaism, Christianity and Islam have a God concept where by God is authoritarian, angry and ever punishing to instill fear in followers and to be forgiving in their controlled masses.
Even if this were qactually True, it d have no barign whatsoever on what was discussed beforehand. Of coruse it snot True either, as Judaism, Christianity, and Ilsam have an understanding of God that is Loving an Benevolent, not just Authoritarian and VInductive, and noen fo them want you to worhsip God jist out of Fear.
What your postign is just propaganda designed to promote a negative viw of the Abrahamic Faiths, not Facts,and its certianly an irratinal respicne here. but yoru rela Motiveisnt to address topics its just to bash Christianity.
Yet tremendous carnage and modern day wars have resulted because of these top three religions of humankind. Not very honourable or good, indeed!
This is what I mean. its pretty obvious that you re just writtign polemic here. You want to depict thwm as basiclaly repsincibel for Great Evils thta d not exist of hey didnt exist,a dn of corus ignore any good that followrrs of these Faiths have cdone inspied by their Respective Religiosu Traditions.
The idea that Abrahamic relgiion is Warlike and yeidls only War and Division is an old Canard and not remotley True, and you don t even really buy it.
While the Amish, the Jains and the Buddhists are more gentler with healthy reverence to regard animals highly and to protect nature. Very honourable and good indeed!
Doens t this contradict yoru above statement though? After all, the Amish are Christians. You want to depict Christians, as well as Muslims and Jews, as prousing Carnage, so why praise the Christain Amish?
Also, iw Warlike are modern day Disiples of Christ? Or the Churches Of Christ? How about modern day Christuian Churches? Mormons? Community CHurch? Anglicans?
WHy single out one CHristain Dnomination as good and act as if the test are just awful?
It is ironic that the political parties such as the republicans and the conservatives have all favoured initiating and perpetuating wars;

Alan Braganza ,
Read this entire post if you will.
It s your dyslexia/dysgraphia that makes me think of Atticus Shaffer who plays Brick Heck in The Middle.
I have no idea who that is.
I don t watch  The Middle .
So, its pretty much meanignlss as a reference to me.
Religions are man made constructs that clash with one another based on fundamentalist and extremism so of course, there is a history of carnage since inception and this will only perpetuate.
This is of coruse bunk. Religion is just a term we use to describe beleifs. Even peopel who today we call Non-Religious, like Atheists, are actuakly Religious. Religion isnt Man Made, its the resutl fo Consciousness. All Religion is just how peopel frame an understanding of existence. Religion and Philosophy are the same thing.
I like religion for its ideals in bringing people together in collective prayer and mutual understandings.
Not all Religions have this.
It would help if religions curb their imposing expectations on politics.
That ay people liek you who  have no Religion  can impose your beleifs on Politics instead.
This is why I don t buy the distinction. Whenever peoepl sy Religion needs ot be out of Politics its so they can order Society and Politics aoccordign to their own prnciples and beleifs.
Its really just a way to get yoru own way.
Well, why should yoru  Non-Religion  be imposed on everyone?
If religion only behaved as science then it would realize its challenges but religion is not scientific.
This is of coruse nonsensical. Neither Religion nor Science behave at all. Peopel do. And unike the Carl Sagan insopired idea that Religion nev3r changes, wgilst Scienc e does, the fact is that Religion does actually change over Time. And Sicence isnt as open to change as peoepl think, because the Peopel who are Scientists are often themselves resistent to Change.
Your angst and frustration is understandable since Exner s writing area of the frontal lobe has now been implicated and I prefer not to argue as my beliefs are sound and can be proved but not here to you.
I m not Frustrated and I don t feel any Angst. Im contradictive to yoru posts, but that snot th esame thing.
Also, stop tryign to sound smarter thna you are. Im critical of yoru simplsitic an dmisguided assessment of Relgiion, thats not really about my Frontal Lobe.
You must take a break and go watch television because you like Brick operate to follow the beat of your own drummer.
This is like yoru sayign Religion shouldn t impose itslf on Politics. It s just you tryign to get rid of opposition without havign to address its concerns.
You are an ineffective and inconsistent thinker and skwills, you really come across rather ignorant whether your angular gyrus is in stasis or not.
The only Reason your sayign this is to belittle me personally and to bluster. Do you really think callign me an Inconsisent Thinker or Ignorant really invaliates what I ve said? You know, the actual things you ve chosen to not address?
No exception for you today and go and pray to God if you have a religion.
Everyone has a Religion, even you. That  the poiunt.
Alan Braganza
Wow, you took much time to reply to my post and please know I am sorry because I did not intend to offend you as you said belittle you so I am mentioning this because you do have some good insights and comments which make sense to me.
Now as for the t.v. show,  The Middle , the person I mentioned is interesting because of intelligent connections he makes but he does become frustrated as expected with his school and home  life as we all may have experienced and may still do. Not important if you have watched this show. Still it would be good for a few laughs because the whole show is a comedy.
Where I disagree with you is where I know religion to be man made and organized as in all the major world religions which have set ceremonies that its followers must pass as they age, when they marry and when they die. The clashing of religions I mentioned are the clashing of ideologies resulting in wars and the carnage then and now and in the future.
The religions of the world while different still share similarities and these similarities are and ought to be our common understandings to share appreciation of God or the concept of The Divine Being. There are people who interpret their religions with extremism and they do very bad things such as what we know about wars in the middle East.
Some religious leaders like to pressure politicians to adopt a controversial stance say on LGBT rights, Right To Life rights compared to Pro Choice for women. This latter one is very topical and controversial (I won t say indeed now I was trying to be funny) Women victims of rape and incest may choose not to have the unwanted child and this should be their option and accepted by medical staff to perform an abortion because of the consequential implications of the victim carrying such to term.  You see there are exceptions to everything.
So please know that I think you have made a good argument and I really hope that your typing and writing with how you select your words will become easier for you.
You have shown yourself to be thinking well and you have made some points effectively well with words and intentions that resonate with me so thanks for taking the time to respond to some of my postings.

RELIGION doens t cause Wats, disagreement and desire do. How many Wars wee fouht in the Modrn Era over Poliical Ideals such as Democracy? Lots.
That only mans Men will kill other Men over disagreements, I dotn see Religion as particulalry moe potent.
As for rituals, they exist anyway. EVen if we pretend not everythign is Relgion, Atheits go hrough weddign ceremonies, and have Funerals which are ritualised.
Thats why I say everyone is Religious, as Relgiion is not created, its just partof how Humans were built. We may nto call our beleifs and rituals  Religious , but thee is no real Difference. Just Visit Washington DC and lok at hte Idols to Lincopln and Jefferson and the like, hwo are they diffeent from Religious STatues exactly?
The whoel term Relgiion is just invented, there is CUlture, and peopel have beleifs, and thats all there is to it.
Alan Braganza
Yes, agreed, it is the discontent among the religious extremes that promote violence and wars and we see this in history and in present day. There are people of conflicting religious beliefs sometimes in opposing countries that will act on their disagreements and discontent with one another as in wars and these are politically motivated.
Religion being invented and man made in essence, does not follow the principles of science as the scientific method of old but religion instead relies on faith, trust and belief systems that are regularly practiced in social gatherings or ceremonies.
A ritual need not be religious such as an athlete doing pre-preparation before an event.
I like your suggestion about the statues to Lincoln and Jefferson and all, about how they are different from religious statues and I must say that they were likenesses of US Presidents while the statues and paintings of Jesus and Mary and others were close approximations of artists depictions of the real Jesus and real Mary. You see, no one at their time had them sit down for a portrait drawing or sculpture. Right? We have our inferred depictions and this brings us back to how people have depicted Jesus sometimes rather light skinned with blue or hazel eyes. Interesting but this is culturally based as I have also seen other more tanned versions of carpenter Jesus and slightly tanned version of Mary.
Thanks, I enjoyed responding to your valid and noteworthy points.

skwills, actually I am only stating the fact about the main three religions, that they are authoritarian and their holy books have poetic phrasing that for the strict interpreters, the fundamentalist readers, there is room for misguided claims and misconceptions which result in conflict and tensions. This has been true in history, in politics and it is today.
These good religions in actuality are beautiful expressions of God and God s love for humans with the need for humans to live good, honourable lives for serving God. Different people however, interpret scriptural writings and religion in different ways having specific intentions and agendas.
People may become defensive when in conflict with sound scientific claims that are repeatedly provable and reproducible so for some people it is best not to discuss science and religion and to debate it profusely. The differences must be accepted and onto the next issue. As for others who view science and religion as separate yet in some ways complementary; it is suitable to have mutual understandings affirmed and appreciated with cohesive respect.
The various religions other than the big three are also very good and they have their unifying purpose to have humans worship God and live good lives.

ACTUALLY, Fundamentalists do allow for some parts of the Bible to be understood Poeticlaly, and aren t so strict in terms of Literalism as to think the entire text must be 100% Literall all the Time. And I say Bible instead of Holy Books ebcause there is no such thing as a Muslim or Jewish Fundamentalist. Fundamentalism is a Protestant Christian Movement.
I also dont htink Science and Relgiion are separate at all. The Truth is, its all just peopel tryign to figre out what is True and what isnt. The distinction is an artifice and Cultural Relic.

Regarding religious fundamentalism, it does exist in religions of the world;  in the case of Islam, it may be referred to as Islamic radicalism.  In the case of Judaism,   Jewish fundamentalism may refer to militant Religious Zionism or Ashkenazi or Sephardic Haredi Judaism. The term  fundamentalism  was originally used in reference to Christian fundamentalism but today commonly refers to the anti-modernist movements of any religion based on literal interpretation of religious scriptures.   (source: Wikipedia)
Also from Wikipedia:  In 1988, the University of Chicago, backed by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, launched The Fundamentalism Project, devoted to researching fundamentalism in the worlds major religions, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism. It defined fundamentalism as  approach, or set of strategies, by which beleaguered believers attempt to preserve their distinctive identity as a people or group   by a selective retrieval of doctrines, beliefs, and practices from a sacred past.  A 2013 study by Wissenschaftszentrums Berlin f r Sozialforschung finds that Islamic fundamentalism is widespread among European Muslims with the majority saying religious rules are more important than civil laws and three quarters rejecting religious pluralism within Islam .
From Wikipedia:  The modern Islamic fundamentalist movements have their origins in the late 19th century.The Wahhabi movement, an Arabian fundamentalist movement that began in the 18th century, gained traction and spread during the 19th and 20th centuries 
 The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern world have grown out of Greece and Rome not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike despicable.    This is a quote from Thomas Henry Huxley,   Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays 
When considering science, it is about explaining the natural world through a scientific empirical and evidence based lens. When considering religion, it is about explaining the non-physical world through a spiritual lens. While there is some overlap, it is simply a way of explaining our perceived reality at this time.

This I feel is one of the gravest mistakes of our Time, misdefining terms to create shadow Villainy and false equivocations.

(source: Wikipedia)
That s all well and good but, think for a minuet. By using the term  Fundamentalist  to refer to any Anti-Modernist movement based on a Literal interpretation of Scriptures, and linking this with Radicalism, you  are basically saying a Fundamental Baptist Church is the same thing as an Islamic Terrorist. After all, they are both Anti-Modern and both tend to have Literalistic views of their respective Scriptures. However, a Fundamental Baptist in the United Sates is not a Terrorist. In fact, despite the fact that we always seem to think of Fundamentalists as hateful Bigots who are intolerant of anyone who doesn t share their views and as strict, uncaring Authoritarians who seek only to impose their Religious Rules onto others and how have no compassion, only a set of rules to follow, the Truth is, many Fundamental Baptists, or members of other forms of Fundamentalist Christianity, can, and often are, tolerant of others who disagree, loving and supportive of their Friends and Neighbours, and often far more flexible in terms of Social order that they are given credit  for.
This is why I reject the absurd notion that a Fundamentalist is anyone who we don t like, and certainly don t describe Islamic Radicals as Fundamentalists. Its unfair to actual Fundamentalists to just assume they are somehow moral equivalents.
The term shouldn t be given such negative connotations.

I don t care how they define the term, I still say its misguided to cast it in such a way.

And this is still wrong. They are not Fundamentalists and by extending the word like this you make it loose meaning.
 The science, the art, the jurisprudence, the chief political and social theories, of the modern world have grown out of Greece and Rome not by favour of, but in the teeth of, the fundamental teachings of early Christianity, to which science, art, and any serious occupation with the things of this world were alike despicable.  This is a quote from Thomas Henry Huxley,   Agnosticism and Christianity and Other Essays 
Yeah this quote is meaningless. For one thing, when Huxley said  Fundamental teachings of early Christianity , he wasn t referring to Fundamentalism. Fundamentalism did not exist yet. He was referring to Christianity in general, using the term Fundamental to mean its basic core teachings, not to distinguish a Movement. He s also promoting the Science VS Religion myth, which had recently been developed by John William Draper and  Andrew Dickson White. The Conflict Thesis has since been discredited by Historians, though it remains popular in broader cultural discussions. Still, the premise of his argument is wrong. Its been proven wrong.
Just quoting Huxley doesn t make him Right.
When considering science, it is about explaining the natural world through a scientific empirical and evidence based lens. When considering religion, it is about explaining the non-physical world through a spiritual lens. While there is some overlap, it is simply a way of explaining our perceived reality at this time.
This isn t True either. Religion is not all about explaining the Non-Physical World. In fact, every Religion that has ever existed has offered explanations about the Physical World and how we live in it. This is an oversimplistic and erroneous view of what Religion is.
Alan Braganza
These published quotes and accepted definitions of terms I gave that you persist in disagreeing with are valid quotes in my opinion. Huxley had his opinion as did many famous people quoting about such matters.
While your non acceptance of some of the points in the other quotes is your opinion, you have a right to your opinion, but it is to your limitation that you are unable to understand beyond your disagreement.  Your understanding of the term  fundamentalist  is still not as I think of it in part as  literal interpretation  which creates multiple interpretations based on who reads into the poetic writing.
People should not be denied or oppressed because of overt religious rules, for even spiritual people will follow what they believe in their respective religions. The same may be said of science and schools of thought where one explanatory belief may have a following different from a second school of thought.
The extremists and radicals are identified in history and today in their strict and unwavering rules that may not be shared by complementary religions or belief systems. Their inability to change their ideological views becomes not only their detriment but does inadvertently affect all society.
My comparison of how we see science and religion is a valid and true to fact comparison but you disagree. It is feeble to think of Religion in the same way as science. Religion in front of science is unable to explain the physical world with valid evidence as you claim. There have been so many divisions in religion historically because of differences of opinion.
Some religious claims supported by physical and scientific evidence is beautifully valid.
Arguably the submission of evidence by people professing to have suitable evidence some religious claims has been scrutinized and criticized as to validity and authenticity.
Every religion that HAS tried to explain the physical world without empirical and reproducible scientific evidence has been unable to validate their claims and so their claims are considered spiritual truths and belief truths as per their tenets, dogmas and doctrines. What I believe as religion and science today explaining our perceived reality at this time is true to fact and valid so I do not know why you are unable to accept that by saying it is erroneous.
For example, I have my beliefs in Roman Catholic faith but I am not overtly in disagreement that God has manifest Himself in other humans at other times to other people thus being in other religious faiths. I do not impose my religious views like the radicals and fundamentalist thinkers; rather I find equal solace and comfort in the explanations of science.
I have an open mind that provides enough reason to scrutinize how religions have diverged in disagreement and have come about to serve a following of people who choose to support it in many ways including financially.
I together with millions of people of various religious faiths do not like the radicals and extremists in every religion aforementioned especially in cults, for these closed minded radicals affect not only themselves but our entire society.
You have to agree that their existence is a detriment to society because their premise, their movements are non valid and their violence make terrible headlines that our police and governments are warring over both here in North America and overseas. Surely you do not make excuses for the radical religions or radicals who associate with a religion incorrectly just for their own agendas?

Alan Braganza  ,
These published quotes and accepted definitions of terms I gave that you persist in disagreeing with are valid quotes in my opinion.
Valid Quotes maybe, but that in no way makes the points they raised, or that you raised, inherantly correct. This is especially True since you quoted them with no real reference to context. Tell me, have you read the actual works of Huxley or Adams? Do you understand what they were saying in full? Furthermore, why should I agree with them? Just quoting someone doesn t mean you ve proven your point no matter whom you quote.
To use an infamous and overused example, to highlight my point, if I quote Adolph Hitler on why the Jews are Evil, have I proven that the Jews are Evil?
I don t usually like Argument by Hitler but, in this case its just to make an extreme point stand out.
The point is, you can t prove something is True by merely quotign it. If you could,then I can quote Ptolomy and prove the Earth is the centre of the Universe, and can quotee aristotle and prove that four basic elements exist in Nature and all else is comprised of them.
I can quote many respected Doctors from centuries ago, too, who told us about hwo the Body works on Humours and those Humours need to be balanced.
Quoting someone from the past in no way makes their point True.
Huxley had his opinion as did many famous people quoting about such matters.
But just quoting someone is not an argument.
It doesn t prove they are Right.
While your non acceptance of some of the points in the other quotes is your opinion, you have a right to your opinion, but it is to your limitation that you are unable to understand beyond your disagreement.
This isn t a very fair statement. You ve basically said that if I reject these quotes as evidence then I don t understand them. But, that means in order to demonstrate that I understand them I have to accept them as True.
Why?
I understand the quotes better than you do, as I ve read the context, I just don t care that Huxley or Adams said them. Sayign they are wrong is not the same thign as not beign able to see past my own opinions. However, insistign yoru Right because of these quotes does mean you can t see past yours.
Your understanding of the term  fundamentalist  is still not as I think of it in part as  literal interpretation  which creates multiple interpretations based on who reads into the poetic writing.
You also seem to think the entire Bible, or other Holy Books, are only Poetic, which I d say is just as foolish as thinkign it entirely Literal.
It s not either-or.
People should not be denied or oppressed because of overt religious rules, for even spiritual people will follow what they believe in their respective religions.
At the same Time, in the name of Secularism we see oppression. No one here is arguing for Oppression but Oppresion doesnt come about more readily just because we brand certain beelifs to be religious, and Secular Ideals aren t really better. In fact I d sy they become a Religion in their own Right.
I d also like to note that one can be a Fundamentalist and be very open to new Ideas and tolerant of others, whilst oen can be very oppressive as a Liberal Secularist.
The same may be said of science and schools of thought where one explanatory belief may have a following different from a second school of thought.
Exactly. On this point we agree.
The extremists and radicals are identified in history and today in their strict and unwavering rules that may not be shared by complementary religions or belief systems. Their inability to change their ideological views becomes not only their detriment but does inadvertently affect all society.
This is simplistic. In fact, its wrong. Usually prohlems emerge precicely because of Change. Times of Change and reformation are the most unstable in a Society. Unchanging beleifs and rpactices, on the othe hand, can and usually are remarkably stable.
My comparison of how we see science and religion is a valid and true to fact comparison but you disagree.
No, yorus isnt a valid and True to Fact comparrison, its a simplistic oen based on a false Paradigm.
It is feeble to think of Religion in the same way as science.
Why?
Can you actually explain why?
Religion in front of science is unable to explain the physical world with valid evidence as you claim.
Why? Because you said so?
Religion is not somethign umanity invented, and began without. Religion is nothing more than a product of Consciousness. Its the framework we use to udnerstand our existence. This Framework begins automatically based on our observations and eperiences. Religion thus naturlaly begins with what we opersonally observe and feel, and only gros viw Communication and second hand learning.
Just because youthonk Religion is purley about the SUpernatural and beleivign in it with no evidence doens t mean this is how Religious Studies operate, and certainly isnt how Religion is understood in Academia. Just read the entries about Religion in Britannica, The Stanford Encyclopedia Of Phiosophy, and on the University Of Cambridges Site, or even try Wikipedia.
Religion is a notoriosuly fluid and difficult to pin down term.
There have been so many divisions in religion historically because of differences of opinion.
The same can be said of literally all Human endeavours, including Sceince. Politics, Philosophy, even Entertainment have this same problem.
That only proves disagreement exists, it des not prove that Relgiion is beleif withotu evidence in a supernatural world only.
Some religious claims supported by physical and scientific evidence is beautifully valid.
Which means you have to admit that Religious CLaims can be so supported. All Im sayign si that the distinction ebtween Science and Religion is artificial to begin with and a cultural construct.
Arguably the submission of evidence by people professing to have suitable evidence some religious claims has been scrutinized and criticized as to validity and authenticity.
Not sure what you mean here, exactly.
Every religion that HAS tried to explain the physical world without empirical and reproducible scientific evidence has been unable to validate their claims and so their claims are considered spiritual truths and belief truths as per their tenets, dogmas and doctrines.
You do know that the Scientific Method and Empirisism are relatively new ideas, right?
What I believe as religion and science today explaining our perceived reality at this time is true to fact and valid so I do not know why you are unable to accept that by saying it is erroneous.
What Im sayign is rronous is the assumption that Relgiion is ourley abotu the Supernatural World, or that it is not connected to observed Reality.
For example, I have my beliefs in Roman Catholic faith but I am not overtly in disagreement that God has manifest Himself in other humans at other times to other people thus being in other religious faiths.
Which is what the Catholic Church teaches 
You d be a poor Catholic if you didnt beleive this.
However, Catholics also beleive that God gave a Perfect Revelation to The Catholic Church herself, and the other Cultures have an imperfect, and sometimes erroneous, undersanding of God.
I do not impose my religious views like the radicals and fundamentalist thinkers;
This is the problem, not all, or even most, Fundamentalists actually try to force their beleifs oto others. Most Fundamentalists are actually tolerant of other beleifs. A Fundamentalist is simply someone who adheres to the Fundamental principles of their Faith, hence the term Fundamentalist. Being a Fundamentalist does not meean you seek to force yoru views onto others.
rather I find equal solace and comfort in the explanations of science.
I don t even make a distinction ebtween Science and Religion.
I have an open mind that provides enough reason to scrutinize how religions have diverged in disagreement and have come about to serve a following of people who choose to support it in many ways including financially.
I together with millions of people of various religious faiths do not like the radicals and extremists in every religion aforementioned especially in cults, for these closed minded radicals affect not only themselves but our entire society.
But in an earlier post you mentioned Creationists as a danger. Most Creationists pose no real threat to anyone though.
You have to agree that their existence is a detriment to society because their premise, their movements are non valid and their violence make terrible headlines that our police and governments are warring over both here in North America and overseas. Surely you do not make excuses for the radical religions or radicals who associate with a religion incorrectly just for their own agendas?
I dont think being a Fundamentalist makes you Violent.
There is a difference.
Alan Braganza
skwills,
You say you do not make a distinction between science and religion. There is significant distinction between religion and science because they are different.
You say being a Fundamentalist does not imply becoming violent  unless authoritarian consequences are given as punishment for disobedience by followers of their faith. For instance, radical fundamentalists such as the Islamic radicals are killing and destroying historic sites in the Middle East with their abominated version of Islam. This is abhorrent and should stop. The same may be said of the radicals who use their religions as a conduit for their destructive agendas. This is what dangerous religious fundamentalism does in the minds of some people. Creationists by comparison appear harmless and their example was given to compare how people explain the age of the Earth.
Religion is in my opinion a guide to live a good life in society and with others a way to honour God yet it is rooted in historical figures and in supernatural occurrences. There is nothing new revealed to humans by God only that what is celebrated cyclically and repeatedly renewed. Does religious study measure and provide new insights that add to humanity? It is a measure of virtuous practice and following religious values that add to and improve humanity.
Good people living good lives in the context of sound scientific principles add to the benefit of society and improve it. This is what must happen and in the name of positive beliefs and progress.
skwills
THE Difference between Science and Religion is imagenary. Its a culturally created construct. In te end its just about what we beleive and why, not abotu absolute thigns liek  Science  or  Relgiion , neither of which actually exist.
As for Fundamentalism, it is defined as folowign the Fundamental tenets of the Protestant Christian Faith. It s not all about Authoritrianism and it isnt about oppressing others who disagree. Thats assumed because we use the term Fundamentalist as a pejorative these days, but tis not inherant in what Fundamentalism is.
And again, the Radical Islamists are not actually Fundamentalists. We call them that only because we see Fundamentalism as bad first, then ascribe it to them. Actual Fundamentlaism, however, is not about forcign others into your beeigfs or oppressing them.
Also,plenty of morn Philosophers and Theologians do, in fact, offer new insights and reevaluate RelgiiosuTeaching. Like Science, Relgiion evovles over Time.
Alan Braganza
Here is a quote from the famous Carl Sagan who writes,    Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both. 
      Carl Sagan,     The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark 
skwills
Sagan also said this.
 Life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astonishing universe, and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy. 
And this.
 In many cultures it is customary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is mere temporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must, of course ask next where God comes from? And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed?  
By Spirituality, Sagan means a sort of Awe or sense of meaning or Grandeur that can make us feel connected to the Universe or feel personally fulfilled, he did not mean Religion, which to him was wrong.
Sagan adhered to the Myth of Science VS Religion, and was himself often wrong.

Um. You can t reconcile your religious beliefs with your scientific beliefs? No offense, but that means you haven t made up your mind. Is the world 6000 years old or 13.8 billion years old?
Your problem is that you have been indoctrinated and you can t realize that Christianity is just man-made mythology. You actually are trying to fuse a fairy-tale and reality.
I don t mean to be offensive, but you re playing both sides of the fence because you are a coward who is afraid of  hell . You have been indoctrinated with the fear of God and it s tough for you to see through the veils of bullshit that have been fed to you since you were born.
If Jesus was born in Palestine (Bethlehem), why does he look like a white, Northern European?
Because its a European, man-made, human-controlling, load of nonsense.
Jim King
It s not European in origin.  The white Jesus is just the most known to us because of Western art but the Byzantines depicted him differently, as did the Coptic Christians.  For the record I m an atheist.
Alan Braganza
In the name of Christianity, there was conquering and colonialism on a global scale. Many modern day Christians and Roman Catholics now choose not to follow and practice their religion as actively as they once may have and choose to be part of a non practicing collective.
Alex Adao
The bible really doesn t say 6000 years by the way. Maybe you ve been too indoctrinated by pseudo atheist bible haters. lol You are generally right about it as a control method.
Alan Braganza
Agreed, it is much in part marketing of a commodity to persuade the masses with promise of great returns. Jesus would look mid eastern/Palestinian with likely brown to dark brown eyes and darker skin.
Alan Braganza
Somehow it exposes the closed mindedness of events of religious history which led to death of the implicated. The Inquisitors were arrogant and proud, unyielding control minded authoritarians.
Many intellectuals were supressed and oppressed; many open minded and free thinkers were burned at the stake. These times were the Christian Dark Ages and during the Christian Dark Ages Humanity did not advance as in the Greek and Roman Ages prior; rather in the Christian Dark Ages because of the power and control of the Church, Humanity regressed. Humanity went backwards and there was no progress in science until The Renaissance.
The missionaries that the Church sent to convert after colonization of foreign lands were sent to gain more followers and more wealth in the form of pillaged or stolen precious metals and gold for Europe. Just look at the churches and palaces of Europe.
Colonialism was conquering at any cost.

 Any  scientist  who attempts to ascribe the process of evolution or the existence of the physical universe to a supernatural creator is at best a fool and at worst a humbug. 
So a scientist who ascribes to the Big Bang theory is a fool?
simon tusting
Actually the Big Bang Theory does not posit a cause for the big bang, just states, with the available evidence that the universe as we know it came into existance 14 billion years ago through an explosion at a point of singularity from which the universe seems to be expanding.
No supernatural being, just statements based on current available evidence

Science does not need religion.  Mankind doesn t need religion.  It does not answer any questions, it only asks us to believe without proof which is contrary to modern thought.
Brandon Roberts
o.k 1. that s not exactly true look at the allignment of the planets and the sizes everything is in the perfect place and the ideal size you expect me to believe that s an accident i just can t if that offends you than you need to learn to settle down and every peice of biblical prophecy is coming true and even nasa is saying something the bible said would happen on the end of days 4 blood moons with a solar eclipse in the midddle. 2. stephen hawking asks you to not believe in something without any real proof so it s o.k for him cause he s a genius. look i don t care what you believe so thank you for your kind words:) and have a happy life wish all your dreams come true.
Jim King
1.  What are you talking about?  The alignment of the planets?  The only one that s  perfect  is Earth because it s the right distance out for life to be possible, but given the billions of galaxies and billions of stars in each that s bound to happen occasionally.  2.  Not exactly.  The difference is that when a better explanation comes along we discard the old one.  Religion doesn t allow that.
Brandon Roberts
yeah that s what i meant but still earth is the perfect size to have an atmosphere 2. thanks for clearing that up for me but we all put faith in something science religon etc. and stephen hawkings probaly an atheist because he s angry and bitter (it s pretty clear) but i don t know so it s not fair for me too judge
Jim King
Hawking doesn t seem angry and bitter, though if he was a more likely culprit would be his condition and not his atheism.
Science and faith do not go together.  Part of the whole appeal of it is that you know why you believe it   experiments prove the answers are real.
Brandon Roberts
o.k that was my point that hawkings if he is angry it s cause of his condition but look if a man is smart and can cure a disease than why should not he be allowed to work in a lab but firing scientists for being basically agnostic is wrong i m sure you believe that too but supercolliders leaving debris does not prove anything and their are failed evoloution experiments and it s still a theory not a fact but i know i believe what i do and you yours so bye and have a great day sir

Religion isnt an absolute thing. Relgiion itslf doesnt have any Dogmas or Docgriens it can sk you to beelvie. I think you mean :Christianity , but weven then you are wrong. Christanity doednt ask you to beleive anythign withotu eviedence.
As for Mankind not needign Relgiion, well, any Phlosophy you device is Religion. Even Athiestic beleif systems are.
http://www.jhalicea.com/ The Great Jon Gatsby
It s funny how religious people are confronted with reality and they need science to proof their religion. The problem is that science don t need religion. In fact religion is the lack of knowledge of the ancient people. They used god for the hardest scientific answers. But in today s society god is small. The more the science answer the truth about our Cosmos the small becomes god. That why god this days is the god of  the gaps and that s why we no need god or religion in science. Religion just shuts down rational thinking and dismiss science.
Alex Adao
I want to see the archetype of  God  finally entered into the realm of accepted science. Surely being that seeded life on earth would qualify as one that fits the archetype we have. Or perhaps the archetype grew in the human psyche because of  leaders  pretending to be god and enslaving their fellow man.
skwills
I diagree with the both of you, with no intended insult.
Faith is not beelif withotu evidence and FReligion is not somethign distinct from Science. In truth, Science, Philosophy, and Religion are all the same thing. In the end, Religion is nothign mroe than what we beleif abotu who we are, where we came from and the ultimatemeanign of our existence. Science isnt chosen over Religion, nd can be, for his makes Sicnece into Religion.
I see no incompatibility with beelif that God exists, and created us, and modern Science, they ae from a Psychological stance just ideas, as is Creationism.
Whiel I am not a creationist, I knwo that Creationism is true to those who beleive in it in the same way Evolution is true for those who accep it, and in the end its just us tryign to make sense of our world.
I find arguments overit or attemots at selective categorisation mroe flawed than anything else.
Physics Police
The kind of faith we re talking about here, religious faith, is indeed defined as belief without evidence.
Religion is a cultural practice more distinct from science than any other thing.
You re trying to confuse the answers to questions with the method of coming up with those answers. Religious leaders and scientists can both answer deep questions. That doesn t make the practice of religion similar in any way with the methods of science.
Evolution is true whether you accept it or not, that s part of the difference between science and religion!
skwills
Religious Faith is not defined as Beleif without evidence. I know your own  Not-A-Religion  dictates that you define it that way as many of your arguments agaisnt Religion rest on how Irrational Religion is and how no evidence exists in Religion, but had it dawned on yo that your  Not-a-Religion  may be wrong?
The Westminster Dictionary Of Theological Terms defines Faith as Trust or Confidence in the Teachings of a Relgiion, or in God, and makes no mention of this beign given without any evidence. The idea that Religious Faith is, indeed, beleif withotu Evidence is unsupported.
In other words, you have no Evidence that the Relgiious Definition of Faith is beleif withotu Evidence.
Just like you have no evidence that Relgiion is the thign the least like Science. The Truth is, you re just spoputing the shallow Dogmas of Militant Ateism, which Ironically is itself a Religion. You re the same kind of mindless Fundamentalist you like to mock and berate.
Relgiion is not distinct from Science and totally dissimilar to it, Religiosu Faigh is not beleif without evidence, and your claism about Relgiion and Methodology dont  make any sene. I nevr said that Answrs and the ways you coem to answrs were the same thing, but Relgiion has no set Methoology vo how Answers are arrived at. What you don t understand is that Relgiiosu Answers arent all just invented and passed down.
With that said, I am not a Creationist, and I can easily say  God exists if yo beleif in him or not  and have the same impact. It s also a stupid thign to contrast Science to Relgiion usign that Line. Religion doesnt teahc that Relgiionsi only True if you beleive in it, so it works the same way Science does,based on the idea that its Trachigns are True Regardless.
Of coruse all this ausmes  Relgiion  is this oen thing, which its not. Relgiion doesnt exist. Religion is a blanket term which covers multiple beleif systems. But you re too lazy to really understand that.
Jim King
Religious faith is indeed belief without evidence, and many religious people over hundreds of years have prided themselves on believing without seeing.  There is no evidence of any kind to support the beliefs of any religion, not just Christianity.  None at all.
skwills
Actually, Relgiion is not a singlualr thign and doesnt defien any terms. the idea that all Relgiiosn define faith as beleif withotu evidence is just bunk.
I can even prove it. if belief Withotu Evidence  was the Relgiiosu Definition Of Faith, then htis is how the word woul be explicitly defined in Religious Dictionaries. Yet The Westminster Dictionary of theological terms doesnot define Faith as beleivign oin soemthign without evidence, but rather as trust in or loyalty to god, or a set of principles, or to another person.
Given that The Westminster Dictioanry of Religious terms is an actual Theological Dictionay composed by Christuans form multiple denominations, and never ocne defines faith as beleif withotu evidence, why shoudl i accept that this is the Religiosu Defimnition of Faith used by Christians? And if its not the Relgiiosu Definition fo Faith used by Christians, why shoudl i accept any other Religion defines it that way?
I keep hearign form Anti-Religiosdu Atheists liek you that Religion defines faith as beleif withotu evidence, btu wbat evidence do you hav of this? a qote out fo context fromt he Bibel liek Hebrews 11:1 which actalky doesnt say this?
By the aay, there is evidence supportign Chridtian claims, and the  Absioltuely no evidence: routien gets old. pick up a boomk by an actual acaemic.
Jim King
The definition in The Westminster Dictionary of Religious Terms is in agreement with what I said.  Virtually every dictionary defines  faith  the same way, along the lines of:  complete trust or confidence in someone or something.  So, what does that amount to?  Believing in what your religion tells you   and they all say, basically, that how anything works isn t your business, that God did it.  That s why it means believing without evidence.  Understand now?
skwills
You see, this is why talkign to a New Atheist becomes tedious. You :know  that all Relgiion says Faith is beleif withotu evidence, and  know  relgiion says :God did it . Well, yoru wrong. I m sorry but, what you r sayign is oure drivel. Religions do nto all Universlsly tell you to just beleive whatever yru Relgiion eaches you withotu question, nro do all Relgiions tell you to never loo for futher ansers and jus beleive, That is how idiitoic New Atheists such as yoruself decpit  Relgiion , its not hwo it actually is. Even the infamous  God did it  arugment is not actually used y Theologians, it is primarily a caricature invented by Militant Atheidts.
If you cannot answer what peopel actlaly ebelive or what Relgion acally is, then yoru arugments arent valid.
Jim King
Religions do tell you what to believe.  Christianity says what you must believe in order to be  saved.  Can you be a Christian and not believe in Jesus?  No.  The Bible itself is full of the things you must believe, and different Christian groups have more (and varying) additional rules.
Religions, especially Christianity, do tell you to look no further because all the answers are supposed to be there.  In the Bible.  You ve said it yourself when I asked what  deep questions  it had the answers to, and you said  all of them.  So, why is there any need to look further?
 God did it  is in fact what it boils down to.  God is responsible for creating everything, and the Bible tells you what you need to know to reach Paradise, what else do you need?
skwills
Lt me break this down as I know you are slow.
There is no such thing as Religion. The term  Religion  is applied to many different beleif systems who do not all share the same definitions of owrds or core concepts. it s ntolike all the worlds Religions are just facets of this one big thing calledd Religion.
With that said, what you re saying still makes no sense. While it is true that you have to beleie certain things to be a Christian, Christianity itself is a spectrum with no single beleif beign shared by all Christians, and even then, Christianity itself is not built on the concept of tellign you to just beleive what Christian leaders tell you and don t seek any other answers about any other topic.
Ni Christian Group that I know of actually says that Literally all answers to any question you may have abotu any topic is all right there in the Bible. You re an idiot if you think they do. Peopel do not learn mathematics from the Bible, nor do they learn European or American History, or Astronomy. Most Protestant Churches actually teach that the Bible is the sole basis for matters of Doctrine in terms of Christianity itself, not that the Bibel contaisn all knwoeldge or that you need not seek any additional knowledge tuside of the Bible. In fact, many Christian Curches have build Universities, some with Research labs, in order to teach things we don t find in the Bible. Vanderbilt, Wesleyan, Notre Dame, Geortetown, heck, even Cambridge and oxford, all Christian Universities, and all teach far mroe than just  beleif the Bible .
The situaton becoems worse when you consider that ROman Catholics don t even think the Bible is the sle basis for all aspects of their Faith, and see the Bible as only a part of the Catholic Faith, a;ong with Sacred tradition and the rulings of the Majesteria. it s uttelry impossible to look at the Catholic Curhc and see a  Bible is the only thing you need  mentality giventhat the Catholic Churhc outright condemns Sola Scriptura as a heresy.
The fact is, what tiu re presentign is a caricature of Christianity, base don a need to see Relgiion, especially Christainity, as hindeign Science and Growth, but it does not reflect the Reality at all.
Also, you pretty well lied abitu me. I did not say the Bible answered all deep questions, I said Religion did. Relgion is not a synonym for The Bible.
As for  god did it is what it boils don to . no, its not, thats an oversimplified Caricature itself that has no basis in fact either.

Before I begin, I know Google defines Religion as beelfi in andreverence of Gods and Spernatural Powers. Google is wrong. And Google is not the sole exclusive Authority.
Religion is a term we use for the beleif systems we hodl to that explains the world we live in, where it came from, what its natue is, and what, if any, meanign it has, as well as how we shoudl live. This is why even  Non-Religious Ohilosoophies  like Secular Humanism are, in fact, Religions themselves.
Relgiion is relaly just aActive Philosophny.
It doesnt have a specific objective or question it answers. The term  Relgiion  is generalised.
Jim King
Try any dictionary.  The wording will vary only slightly, the meaning will be the same.  You don t know what philosophy is.

Philosophy, from the Greek meaning Love Of truth,. it is the disiplin of applying thouht to questiosn regardng ou existence in the hopes of resolving those wuestions.
Religion is a set of beelifs about the nature of our existence, concerned with ansiwrgn the ultimate questiosn such as our origins, end, and purpose.
I m sorry but, they have similar or the same definitions. The distinction exists only becaue people liek you hate Religion but like Philoophy, so imagine the separation.
Jim King
I don t recall saying I liked philosophy, but anyway you re wrong.  The definition of philosophy has changed over the centuries since the ancient Greeks and no longer means that.  Just like we now use the word scientist instead of natural philosopher.  Even the Greeks never really used it the way you assume.  This is partly why Socrates was prosecuted for impiety.

Follow the wise words of first one to postulate the ideas of the Big Bang, Prof. Georges Lemaitre. He used to say that both science and religion can co-exist in your mind as two parallel and incompatible interpretations of the universe. Eventually, there is a chance religion will fade away. In my case, I was raised catholic and during high school I had completely rejected christian religion as something irrelevant, superfluous, demeaning, childish and, of course, incompatible with science. We do not need religion for absolutely anything.
Jerry Asbridge
We?  Would it not be more correct that you and many others do not need religion for absolutely anything.  Many others would say the opposite. I like this quote from Lemaitre:
 As far as I can see, such a theory remains entirely outside any metaphysical or religious question. It leaves the materialist free to deny any transcendental Being  For the believer, it removes any attempt at familiarity with God  It is consonant with Isaiah speaking of the hidden God, hidden even in the beginning of the universe. 
So, the materialists, skeptics & atheists should all be free to deny the existence of a deity. I celebrate that and find that I learn much from such a perspective.  I hope they, in turn, would allow me the freedom to be a theist (even if it means leaving me at peace in my supposed illusion).
Diogo
You are right. I should have said  If you reason you will realize that we do not apply religion for anything or religion is superfluous.  I am might be wrong, but when you go through any kind of transcendental and awe-inspiring moment, it does not make this moment better if you think that  god  did that for you. I think it is just childish, but you can be at peace with your illusion. However, the reality is that bullish, nonsense, stupid religion still keep being spread like viruses to children. Just keep to yourself, do not tell them to do good because then they will go to heaven or assume a position of submission to something that has not proven to exist. Let them decide that and maybe they will realize  Oh look, how stupid are those people wasting time praying for nothing, thinking about heaven/hell/angel/miracles. Well, I am not going to do that.

Atheist is the lack of belief in supernatural entities and associated organized religious dogmas, period. Science is all about explain the natural world (i.e., the only one:)) using falsifiable hypothesis, experimentation, measurements, empirical research. More importantly, scientific theories get superseded by others without any issues. Religion is based on unproven dogmas, faith (believe without evidences), revelation, prayers, all bullshit, crap, meaningless.
skwills
Atheism is not the lack of beleif in the supernatural and in Relgiiosu EDogmas. Aheism is the belif that there are no gods. While it is True that most Atheists in the Modern World ae Materialists who reject the existence of the Supernatural, the term  Atheist  is defined as the beleif that thre are no gods, and has no real reference to either Religion or to the Supernatural.
Atheism is also a beleif rather than a lack of belief.
Science is also not limited to the Natural World, Science is acually a method of inquerry. Science is the aplication of a set Sc9entific Method to any given observed Phoenomenon.
If the Supernatural exited and coudl be observed, then one coudl apply the Scientific method to it.
Faith is not beleiving somethign withotu evidence, either,. Faith comes from the Latin word Fidese and axtually means Trust or Confidence in a given proposition. While it may be popular for Militant Atheists to define Faith as beleivign in somethign without Evidence, this has never been the actual definition usd by most people, nro is it  The Religiosu definition of Faith . No Religious Dictionary defines it that way.
Rekifion itself is nothign mroe than an active, applied Ohilosophy that explains the world we live in.
The claims you make are just propaganda foisted by Contemproary Ah4ist whoo think they can create a clesr deliniation ebtween their Atheism, backed by Ratioanlity and Sicnece, and Relgiion, whcuib sui all made up crap, but the Truth is, yioru  Atheism  is not mere Atheism, its mroe of a Humanism, and you have as many presuppositions and dogmas as any other Relgiion wuld. Yoru own ebelfis are, in fact, a form fo Relgiion, though oen that says Relgiion si bad and isnsits yoru beleifs arent Relgiion.
By the way, Religiosu beelifs also change over Time, both in ters of individual beelifs, and in terms of what is taught formally by Religiosu Orignisatins. Also, Science is as flld with stubon refusals of new ideas and rejection fo Facts tjhat dotn suit Theories peopel beelive in, because its also run by Humans with the same flaws.
The Scienc VS Relgiion claim si a Myth, liek the idea of Atheism beign linked to Rationality.
Diogo
Stop writing rubbish. Science is built on falsifiable hypothesis and  god , whatever that crap means, is not one.
Atheism is the lack of belief on supernatural entities. Just like you is atheist with respect god Zeus, I am atheist with respect all gods.
  If the Supernatural exited and coudl be observed, then one coudl apply the Scientific method to it.    There is no such thing as supernatural or paranormal, there is only natural and normal.
  the idea of Atheism beign linked to Rationality.    Who said Atheism is linked to rationality or science? There is no evidence for gods, then I am atheist. There is no evidences for unicorn, I am an a-unicorn, etc.
You have a poor writing and reasoning. I rest my case.
skwills
I didn t write rbbish, you did. Look at Atheism. You r sayign its lack of beelif in supernatural beigns. Well, thats bunk. The term is derived from A, meaning without, and Theos, meaning god, so an Atheist is one wthout a god. It is not about the Supernatural at all, and, again, while most modern Atheists do in fact reject the existence of the Supernatural, that still does not alter the specific definition of the term. An Atheist is one who beleives there are no gods.
Atheism is also not a lakc ofbeleif as is evidenced by the mere fact that too many Atheists say God does nto exist, which is an assertion fo fact that God does not exist and hence an expression of a beleif that God does not exist.
Also, it is God, cap G, because its used as a name.
As to your assertion that there is no such thign as the Supernatural or paranormal, only the natural and Normal, this proves my point. You are assertign eelifs, not lack of beelifs.
It s also rather missing the point. If the only Reason Science can be applied exclusively tot he natural World is because the natural World is all that exists, this still doesnt mean Science cudlnt be applied to the Supernatural if it existed. The only thing that limits Science tot he natural World woudl be the nonexistence fo anythgin else.
It s not inherant in Science to be so limited.
By the way, your beign gdogmatic in oru assertion that the Supernatural doesnt exist. You don t have evidence that the  atural World is all that exists, thisis just a tenet of your own Religion, and one you demand we all confirm to. Is that relaly better than the  Religious people  you critisise?
By the way, I m dyslexic.
Also, can the  No evidence  routine. You arent an Atheist becaue there is no evidcne for God, you juyst repeat that mantra. There actually is eviddence for god s exitence which can be foudn readily on Stanfords website, ro any othe acadmeic oen dealign in Philosophy. The  
No evidence  Routine is just bunk itself.
Diogo
Actually is  god , just like  unicorn ,  flying spaghetti monster .
Again, there is no evidence for  god , just like there is no evidence for jesus (I am talking about the x-men that was crucified but did not die. I wonder if the crucifixion was lame), ETs, spiritis, that elvis is still alive,etc 
skwills
Jesus did die in Christianity, though, he is sai to have returned to life but he did die.
That said, again, drop the  no evidence  routine, and for that amtter the  Flyign sphagetti monster . These assertiosn only further prove that you are a dogmatic fundamentalist who refuses to even consider the possibility that tyou may be wrong about anything and also cements the cast that youre not Rational at all and just pushign a Polemic.
Insultign Jesus by callign him an X Man in order to try to depict beelif in him as absurd, comparign god to Unicorns, spellign god in lower case becsue golly gee willigers I lack ebelfi in him, its all just stupid.
God is spelled with a Capital G because God is sued as a name, mockery of Jesus is not evidence of anyhign but yoru own closed mondedness, and the fact that you won t spend five minuets lookign upp the argumnts peopel make to defend beelfi in God, other than the strawman versiosn on Atheist websites, and can only repeatt he mantra of  No evidence  really only serves to prove how you are nothign mroe than a parrot blidnly repeatign nonsense that you picked up.
Diogo
Ok. Seriously. Do you know the difference between jesus and a picture of jesus? You only one nail to hang a picture of jesus.
I am sorry, but I have to ridicule you since you treat evidences as mantra. Observation, experimentation, measurement are what I use as evidences. And I follow the evidences where they lead without making up stories for things that are unknown.  god  is nothing, meaningless, useless, etc. Now, go pray to avoid ethernal hell.
skwills
I m not Treatign evidence as Mantra. You haven t presented evidence for anythign you ve claimed, though, all you ve done is declared yoruself Right. This includes declarign yoruself Right on things that are demonstratably wrong.
I ve made few assertions and the bulk of my post is a refutation of what you hve specifically said.
You didnt use Observation, mesurement, and experimentation to come up wuith the Flyifn Sphage3tti Monster crap, and you won t even take a few minuets to parous Argumnts for God s existence on Philosophical sites in order to see if they ever employ evidence. Declarign that peopel whop beleive in God never have evidence is itself a falsifiable claim, and one that if subjected to any kidn of inquerry collapses.
You can t even spell God wih a cap G, or whtotu scare qores.
face reality, all this talk fo Evidence and Observation is propaganda. You re just repeatgn the party Lien of the nauveu Atheists.
Diogo
Where are your evidences for  god ?
skwills
There are no evidences for  god . I argue for evidence existign for God. If you have o intentionally sopell  god  wrong, why should I repeat myself?
By the way, I say reopeat myself as I already gave one soruce.
Say God, with a cap G and no quotes, then I ll tell you.
After all, its more trouble hittign the shift key twice than once.
Diogo
There are no evidences for any kind of any kind of god; the abrahamic god, zeus, thor, khrsisna. Good luck trying to prove that.
skwills
You ve just proven my point. You can t even bring yourself to do somethign simple, liek spell God properly, without quotations.
Your Atheism is not based on Reason and evidence, and you dont reject God s existance because of a lack of evidence. It s baed on the emrbace of your own Religion, which you hold to mainly to give yoruself a sense of self worth at the expence of Theists.
You don t want evidence, you just want me to say somethign you can shoot down. Even if your countrargument is utterly Irrational, you d see it as proof positive that what I said was false.
You just can t admit you r wrong.
Diogo
Where is your evidence for god? You are stupid to realize that god is used as lowercase to refer to a category of worshiped supernatural entities.
skwills
Actually your the stupid one here. While it is True that the word god is not used as a name all the Time, and thus not capitalised all the Time, if you use the term as if it is a name to refer to a specific entity, then it is a name. This includes asking for evidence for god s existence. You see, you are addressing a specific entity, and calling said entity god. Leaving god in lower case is thus poor grammar because you aren t speaking of the gods, or a god, but specifically about God.
So, as I said before, there is no evidence for the existence of god, but there is evidence for the existence of God. aSpell it properly and I ll tell you where.

Neil deGrasse Tyson on Cosmos, the Scientific Method, Religion
The star astronomer spoke to National Geographic
by #teamEBONY,       March 10, 2014
Comments
Neil deGrasse Tyson
In its first airing, Cosmos created a new star, Cornell astronomer Carl Sagan. The seminal series opened the eyes of millions to the universe and made a science celebrity out of Sagan.
Now astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson is stepping up to star in a 13-part remake of the series on the National Geographic Channel and Fox. The first show airs on Sunday, March 9 (at 9 p.m. ET/PT), and will be broadcast in more than 70 nations the biggest launch ever for a global TV series. National Geographic spoke to Tyson, the director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium, about life, the universe, and the "cosmic perspective" Cosmos will offer viewers.
Why re-create Cosmos? Why now?
Any time is good for Cosmos. A lot of things have come together to make this the right time to do it. We have come so far in the last 34 years more than a generation. Clearly it s time for another Cosmos. Since then we have discovered a thousand new planets. A lot has changed. Back in 1980 we were trapped in a Cold War mind-set, which polarized people and affected everything. People thought of the environment as a local thing. They didn't think of the global environment and how we are all connected.
What's new about this Cosmos?
With Cosmos, this version, we're able to bring a whole tool kit of storytelling cinematics to bear on the science, the history, the culture, and the politics to fill people with a sense of wonder about our universe. It might even impact people spiritually. I mean that with a little s. That s the reaction some people might feel by gaining the cosmic perspective seeing that we are just a small part of the vastness of everything. But that can be emotionally fulfilling in a very deep way.
What are the most important advances you ve seen since 1980 that the new Cosmos will consider?
The purpose of Cosmos is not to be a textbook to tell people about the latest discoveries. The whole point of telling these stories is to allow you to understand that science, the scientific method, is central to all of our lives. Yes, we'll learn more science, about the scientific method. But what we really want is for people to say, "Wow, I didn't know we were all connected in that way." That's the goal.
Why is understanding the scientific method so important?
Because it's how we make discoveries and how we understand and survive in our world today. Just think for how long humanity was controlled by mystical, magical thinking the diseases and suffering that led to. We managed to survive, but just barely. It wasn't pretty.

Unless you were hiding under a rock, you probably heard about the relaunch on Fox Television of the famed science based television program Cosmos. Originally the vehicle of science icon Carl Sagan, the new show is produced in cooperation with his wife Ann Druyan and helmed by astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson. This review includes spoilers below.
In the first episode, deGrasse Tyson leads off the show with a call to viewers to join the heros of the past and  do science ; a worthy description of the scientific method that may make some subset of Fox Television viewers uncomfortable. This show is going to include discussion of the conventional scientific view of the origins of the universe and biological evolution for example.
To make this journey we ll need imagination, but imagination alone is not enough because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine. This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers strictly adhering to a simple set of rules. Test ideas by experiment and observation, build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones that fail. Follow the evidence wherever it leads and question everything. Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.
 Earth  our home address.
If the opener, Standing Up In The Milky Way, is any example, Cosmos is not going to be much of an intellectual challenge to many readers of H+. The opening episode explores the familiar theme of our humble place in the vast universe made famous in the Eames film  Powers of Ten .
While it explores territory we are familiar with, the update is fresh and includes ideas such as the multiverse and crisply shows the real scale of human lives and our world. For those who are not familiar with these ideas, this show will open their eyes at least if they are ready to watch and learn. Cosmos will I expect inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers. And it is fun to watch.
Starting from Earth, Tyson leads us out into the solar system, to the Milky Way galaxy, to the local group and beyond to the  Virgo supercluster  and even beyond this, to the furthest edge of the known universe and a network of 100 billion galaxies.
The show is not going to shy away from controversy it seems. The first episode follows with the story of a revolution in human ideas at the dawn of the scientific method which is known as the Copernican Revolution. The trial by the Catholic Church of Giordano Bruno is retold in the form of an animation; Seth MacFarlane creator of Fox s hit Family Guy is the executive producer of Cosmos and it shows right here.
This sequence was unexpectedly emotional and depicts the conflict between Bruno s vision of the universe and the existing geocentric and  finite universe  dogma of the Catholic Church at that time. The segment ends with Bruno being burned alive while being menaced with a cross. Wow.
Following a presentation about the age of the universe in comparison to human evolution, the show ends with a very personal homage to Carl Sagan from Tyson himself. Some may find the science content a bit too light for their tastes, but Neil deGrasse Tyson performs admirably and confirms himself as the heir to Sagan s large legacy in this first show. I m looking forward to watching and sharing the rest.
Missed it? You can watch the first episode of Cosmos on Fox s website  here . And also check out the Q&A session at the Griffith Observatory .

Rebooting Cosmos
by Jeff Foust
Monday, March 10, 2014
Calling the premiere of a new series a  television event  can sound like hyperbole. In the case of new version Cosmos, though, that language can be justified. Fox had been promoting the series for months, including an ad during what is unarguably a television event, last month s Super Bowl. The premiere of Cosmos aired last night in an unusual simulcast on ten different networks, from the flagship Fox broadcast network to obscure outposts on the far end of the cable dial like FXX and Fox Sports 2.
A conclusive judgment is impossible until the entire series runs, but last night s opening episode shows that this new Cosmos has some promise.
And, unlike the typical television series, Cosmos got a send-off from the President of the United States.  America has always been a nation of fearless explorers, who dreamed bigger and reached farther than others imagined,  President Obama said in a 30-second introduction.  That s the spirit of discovery that Carl Sagan captured in the original Cosmos. 
What he, the show s producers, and many others hope is that the new Cosmos captures that same spirit of discovery that has, over the years, almost been mythologized. The executives at Fox that greenlighted the show, and spent many millions of dollars, on it also hope it captures views and advertisers. Will it?
A conclusive judgment is impossible until the entire series runs, but last night s opening episode shows that this new Cosmos has some promise. Host Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist anointed  the next Carl Sagan  long before plans for remaking Cosmos were announced, takes viewers on a whirlwind tour of both space, from the Earth to the edge of the observable universe, and time, compressing the 13.8-billion-year history of the universe into a single year. In between, he tells the story of Giordano Bruno, the 16th century man who first argued we were not at the center of the universe, and for such heresy was burned at the stake.
This Cosmos has elements of both new and old in it. The special effects, as one might imagine, are spectacular, and far beyond what was possible 35 years ago when the original series aired. The iconic ethereal soundtrack of the original series, by Vangelis, has been replaced by a new soundtrack by Alan Silvestri, but it, too, does not overpower. Tyson, like Sagan, travels through space and time in his  Spaceship of the Imagination,  albeit one with a much sleeker design than the dandelion-inspired one Sagan used. Even the cosmic calendar Tyson walked viewers through in the opening episode is borrowed from one Sagan used in the original series.
The one thing jarring about the episode was not the show itself, but the commercial interruptions. The original Cosmos aired on PBS, without commercials, but on Fox, and in prime time, commercials are a necessity. That led to some odd juxtapositions of content: while Tyson hailed the triumph of science over superstition and the promise of a bright future, the commercial breaks included ads for a Biblical epic (Noah) and a movie set in a dystopian future (The Hunger Games.)
Few, though, doubted the quality of the special effects that would be used in the new Cosmos. More people questioned how seriously Fox a network not known for highbrow entertainment or documentaries would take a show like Cosmos. The fact that one of its executive producers is Seth MacFarlane, best known for television shows like Family Guy, didn t increase the confidence of skeptics. And while Tyson had long been compared to Sagan, and had television experience hosting PBS s Nova ScienceNow, some wondered if he was the right person to host a reboot of the show.
 Science, and in particular astrophysics, is in the hearts and minds of the public right now, and it is growing,  Tyson said earlier this year.
Part of the skepticism stems from his public speaking experience, where Tyson doesn t exude the calm demeanor of a Sagan. For example, in an on-stage interview Saturday at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Festival in Austin, Texas, ostensibly to promote the series, Tyson jumped from tangent to tangent, excitedly veering off what appeared to be a planned script for the event.  You know, Neil, we re going to be doing something else,  his interviewer, science journalist Christie Nicholson, said at one point, as Tyson was opining about the lack of ice caps on an inflatable globe during an intended demonstration of the scale of the solar system. ( Don t get me started on Pluto,  he advised earlier in his SXSW interview, before going off on a tangent about the former ninth planet.  That would derail the whole thing. )
Tyson has also rubbed some members of the professional astronomical community the wrong way with a perceived emphasis on self-promotion over science. In a plenary talk at an American Astronomical Society (AAS) conference in January outside of Washington, DC, Tyson started with a hopeful message for the audience of professional astronomers and students.  I think science is rising, it is percolating up from fertilized ground, and it is on a level I have not seen before,  he said.  Science, and in particular astrophysics, is in the hearts and minds of the public right now, and it is growing. 
Tyson attempted to prove this by demonstrating how science was becoming a greater part of pop culture, from ComicCon to Internet memes to even tattoos. However, as the talk progressed, many in the audience saw Tyson talking less about science in pop culture and more about Tyson himself, from diving into the statistics of his Twitter followers (currently about 1.7 million) to showing a screenshot of his weekly schedule, packed with meetings and trips.
On the backchannel of Twitter, some attendees expressed displeasure with the tone of Tyson s talk.  I have to say, I am not seeing much of a message from this talk, except that the speaker thinks he s awesome,  tweeted Australian astronomer and author Bryan Gaensler in a comment typical of the criticism many in the audience expressed about the talk.
But the Tyson who appears in Cosmos is not the manic or narcissistic character that some might conclude him to be from some of those public appearances. He s clearly excited about the wonders of the universe that he plans to show viewers, but he does so in a calm, confident way like Sagan.
The opening episode about Cosmos, though, is a little bit about Tyson at the end, but in a good way. Many know from Tyson s previous talks and writings that, as a high school student in the mid-1970s, he traveled by bus from New York City to Ithaca to visit Carl Sagan at Cornell University. He recounts that story at the end of the episode and pulls out a calendar of Sagan s, with Tyson s name written in it on the day of his visit. It is an emotional passing of the torch from one generation to the next, from one Cosmos to the next.
Whether this next-generation Cosmos is a success won t be known until after the series finishes airing and perhaps for not long after. While Fox will soon be able to judge if the advertising and other revenue from the series made it profitable, the success of the series to further germinate what Tyson described in January was the public s growing interest in science in general, and space science in particular, may take many years to gauge. It was apt, then, for Tyson to close out the first episode with this advice:  Our journey is just beginning.

Almost 20 years after the death of Carl Sagan, his popular TV show is being rebooted and has been given a 21st century makeover. The new show has really big shoes to fill but 20th Century Fox hopes that the remake will be just as popular as the original show was on PBS.
The show's producers have high hopes for the new series titled Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey. Hosted by famous astrophysicist Neal deGrasse Tyson, the new show will air for 13 weeks on Fox at 9 p.m., taking the coveted Sunday night spot often reserved for animated comedies, according to CNN Money .
The new show was revived in 2009 when Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy, invited Tyson to lunch. MacFarlane helped Tyson and Ann Druyan, Sagan's widow and the new show's producer and creator, pitch the show to Fox's executives. CNN Money explains that Fox executives Kevin Reilly and Peter Rice "both liked the idea of doing something that no one had ever done before," so MacFarlane's and Druyan's production companies began work on the improved show.

"The difference today is not only have visual effects advanced, but because this is airing on a major network, we had the resources -- we had access to people who have told these great dramatic stories on the big screen," Tyson explained. The show will keep some aspects of the old series like the Cosmic Calendar but will also feature new things. The show will attempt to bring science back into the mainstream .
"Carl made it possible for everyone to feel goose bumps about the grandeur, beauty and romance of life in the cosmos," Druyan told the New York Daily News about her husband's work. "There are many surprises in the new show, and we're going places that Carl and I in the original series never got to go."
With sophisticated special effects and animated segments, the new show aims to make science more accessible. Fox and the show's producers are aiming big with the new show, according to the Daily News , since they will air the new episode simultaneously on multiple channels in the U.S. and in other 171 countries.

March 10
by Staff Reporter  
A new must watch for Science geeks has premiered making weekends more lovable. This was after Cosmos, a remake of the 1070s classic series from astronomer Carl Sagan, was released on Sunday.
The flagship episode of the science series has gotten viral on Twitter. This was after hashtag #COSMOS went trending. Hashtag #COSMOSspoilers also mocked followers on Twitter, reported Los Angeles Times.

The excitement from the audience is not a surprise at all. This was after the remake of the orginal Cosmos series had already touched millions of aspiring scientists from way back then. This would include the creator of the hit series Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane.
According to a Los Angeles Times review, many of the old Cosmos fans would consider a remake heretical. However, as there aren t any science series airing on major cable providers, Cosmos provide a relief. The primetime science extravaganza series airs on Fox that showcases the engaging astronomer Niel deGrasse Tyson.

Neil DeGrasse Tyson: Media Need to Stop Giving Equal Time to Anti-Science Views
by Josh Feldman | 12:42 pm, March 10th, 2014
 
Neil DeGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium and star of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey, appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources Sunday to talk about the show and media treatment of science in general. Tyson spoke of the innate hypocrisy of people rejecting modern science while embracing the very best of scientific discovery  that we so take for granted today,  and without it,  we will just regress back into the cave. 
Stelter referenced his own recent commentary about how the media should not be giving equal time to anti-science views, and asked Tyson what he believes the media s responsibility on this issue should be. Tyson said the media shouldn t be in the business of giving  equal time to the flat-earthers. 
 Science is not there for you to cherry-pick. You know, I said this once and it s gotten a lot of Internet play, I said the good thing about science is that it s true whether or not you believe in it. All right? I guess you can decide whether or not to believe in it, but that doesn t change the reality of an emergent scientific truth. 
Stelter also asked about how Cosmos, a scientific show, will keep viewers entertained. Tyson replied,  The very nature of that question presumes that real science and real entertainment cannot be the same thing unless one compromises to the other.

In 1980, Carl Sagan opened his series Cosmos with these words, capturing both the immensity and intimacy of the universe.  Now, thirty four years later, Neil DeGrasse Tyson stands on the same seaside promontory Sagan used to open his program to introduce Cosmos to a new generation.
Advertisement
The Ship of the Imagination
For his series, Sagan created the Ship of the Imagination, a dandelion seed-like snowflake of light and perception which could travel the cosmos unfettered by the limitations of space and time. Tyson's newly christened Ship of the Imagination is a slick, environment mapped craft reminiscent of Boba Fett's which travels not only through the billions of light years of our visible universe, but also across the decades of advancement in telescopy, filmmaking and visual effects. His Cosmos appears more polished, more richly detailed, but also more familiar to the generation raised on images from the Hubble.
And where Sagan began his voyage out in deep space and slowly made his way toward the inner solar system, Tyson begins his journey here, on Earth, and uses the Ship to establish our cosmic address: Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Local Group, The Universe.
Advertisement
Your God is Too Small
Sagan and Tyson both follow the Ship of the Imagination with stories of men who helped bring scientific thought to the world. These stories establish the importance of science to humanity and represent the greatest contrast between today's Cosmos and the Cosmos of yesteryear.
Sagan choose for his subject the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, who correctly calculated the curvature of the Earth by comparing noonday shadow measurements taken at different latitudes and follows with a paen for the lost Library of Alexandria. Tyson's subject, told in animation, is the story of Giordano Bruno, the sixteenth century monk who challenged church teaching on the centrality of the Earth and the infinite nature of the universe.

Sagan, worried about the nuclear arms race and the potential for humanity to destroy ourselves, warned us of the fragility of knowledge and what we can all lose if we're too careless with fire. Tyson, on the other hand, warns us of the danger of living in a world where questioning official stories becomes heresy, where curiosity becomes thought crime and where exploration of the universe becomes a trespass into the dominion of authority.
In Tyson's Cosmos, Bruno speaks to his fellow believers and tells them that if they cannot accept a universe where the stars are truly suns, where Earth is but one of many planets and where the scope of creation extends into infinity because these ideas violate their sense of God, then it is their sense of God that is too small.
But there is a danger is making a God that is too big as well. A theory of anything is a theory of nothing, and there is just as much harmful dogma in giving equal time to geocentrists and flat Earthers as there is in forbidding ideas that contradict a holy book. "We will speculate," said Sagan in his introduction, "but we will always remember that there is a difference between speculation and fact." At a time when our leaders openly characterize science as "just another worldview" and suggest that it's simply not fair that myths and hunches should not be given an equal place at the table as theories and data, this restatement of the purpose of science is more than a little bit welcome.
The Cosmic Calendar
The final element in both Sagan's and Tyson's first episode is the Cosmic Calendar, which presents the entire history of the cosmos compressed into a single year. Having placed our home world in its spatial context and our epoch in historical context, the Cosmic Calendar places our entire existence in its temporal context: if the universe was one year old, civilization would be less than ten seconds old. Everything we've ever heard of, every battle, every king, every empire, every invention, every tragedy and every triumph exists in those scant few final seconds of the Cosmic Year.
Sagan ends his premiere episode with a slightly metaphor-breaking question about how our civilization will face the first seconds of the next cosmic year and whether we will have the wisdom to avoid destroying ourselves and prove ourselves worthy inheritors of the vast cosmos we inhabit.
Tyson answers this question by bringing the story back to Carl Sagan himself, recalling the contributions he made not only to cosmology and planetary science, but also to Tyson's own life as well as our own. On a different, more humble calendar, Tyson shows us a meeting Carl Sagan had scheduled on December 20th 1975 with a 17 year old kid from the Bronx named...Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

In her introduction to the 2005 re-issue of the original series, Ann Druyan described Cosmos as "both a history of the scientific enterprise and an attempt to convey the soaring spiritual high of its central revelation: our oneness with the universe."
In tying Sagan's personal voyage back to his own, Tyson not only elevates Sagan to the pantheon of scientific visionaries like Bruno, Eratosthenes, Kepler, Galileo and the others who struggled to light a candle and banish the darkness of the demon haunted world, but he reminds us that the value of science must be told and retold to each subsequent generation.
Whether we're confronting the scientific "hostage situation" created by Cold War hegemony or filtering the deluge of dubious information that the current generation absorbs on a daily basis, science is the corrective lens that helps us see more clearly that our faults lie, as ever, not in our stars, but in ourselves.
Cosmos airs each Sunday night at 9:00 on Fox TV.

Fans are upset that the show didn't use the comic book version of the creation of the universe.
Source: ThanosCopter Newswire
Last night, Fox aired the long awaited premiere of Cosmos, a remake of the 1980 Carl Sagan show.  Produced by Seth Macfarlane and narrated by popular astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, the series debuted to both critical acclaim, fan hype and high ratings.  However, not everyone is happy with the way the series depicted the birth of the universe.  
A group of rigidly inflexible extremists are speaking out against the show for what they feel is an inaccurate depiction of the Big Bang, citing a dated piece of literature as proof.  "I was really excited to see how Cosmos showed the creation of the universe," said Geoffrey Graver, a 51 year old analyst from Portland Oregon. "Imagine my disappointment when they didn't show a giant cosmic hand grabbing a spiral galaxy in the center of a astronomical maelstrom." 
Graver and several others are upset that Cosmos didn't use DC's Crisis on Infinite Earths' theory of the multiverse, which states that an Oan scientist named Krona created the multiverse when he attempted to view the beginning of the universe, causing all sorts of weird shit to go down.  "With all of Tyson's talk of the multiverse and the Big Bang, you'd think he'd have the good grace to acknowledge that it all came about when an alien tried to glimpse at forbidden knowledge," Graver said.  He went on to express his displeasure that the show also didn't reference the Source Wall or the Fourth World, both key components in DC's universal theory. 
Graver stated that he's spoken to dozens of like-minded fans and have even gone as far as to petition the US government to force Cosmos to reference the DC theory of creation, citing that viewers would have an otherwise be presented with an incomplete set of universal creation theories. "It's not that I don't mind Cosmos discussing other theories about the creation of the universe," Graver said.  "It's just that I want them to talk about the correct one as well. You know, the one that involves a giant hand squeezing a galaxy like a melon."
The Outhouse reached out to deGrasse Tyson for comment, but he was busy with speaking to real websites, so we turned to the only other scientist we know for his opinion on Graver's complaints. "It's true," said Thaddeus T. Puffinbottoms, professor of Bullshit Astrophysical Theories at the prestigious DeVry University.  "Cosmos didn't references giant cosmic hands, Thetans, Cthulhu, or conflicting creation stories found in the same chapter of Genesis.  If you were looking for fanciful, but totally legitimate, theories on how the universe was created, you'd be disappointed."  
Graver isn't the only person upset with Cosmos.  "I watched Cosmos just so I could bitch about  The Big Bang Theory on Facebook and write fifteen articles about it on my website," said Gus Sterlingham, a self-proclaimed know it all and journalist.  "So imagine my surprise when Sheldon Cooper, Penny No Last Name, or Leonard Hofstadter didn't make appearances on the show.  How am I supposed to whine about a television show if they don't put things in there that I don't like?" 
National Geographic will air an encore of the controversial episode tonight, featuring new material.  New episodes will air on Sundays.

As controversies about Juan Pablo Galavis abound, the Bachelor was in Las Vegas, Nevada, to watch a boxing match over the weekend. The reality TV star also visited a chapel two nights before the show's finale is set to air.

Far short of controversial comments, Juan Pablo Galavis hit Las Vegas, Nevada, to watch a boxing match just two nights before the The Bachelor finale airs. The opinionated single father apparently also visited a wedding chapel as a possible hint to how the hit dating show might end.

Galavis decided to document his whole trip on Twitter. Mainly there to watch fellow countryman Jorge Linares of Venezuela take on Nihito Arakawa in a boxing match, Galavis also jokingly took a photo of the MGM wedding chapel.
In the photo, Galavis stands in front of the chapel smiling and pointing to the entrance, seemingly teasing fans with what might be a hint to how the show ends in the final episode.
Galavis traveled with two pals who accompanied him to the fight and later to a dinner with 10 members of Linares' boxing team. The group ate at Joe's Stone Crab, staying at the eatery for more than two hours.
"It was him and a bunch of guys who were a part of the Venezuelan fighter's team and a couple of older ladies with big hair," a source for People magazine said.

After the meal, Galavis and his two friends went to Beacher's Madhouse nightclub for a short visit. The 32-year-old The Bachelor star didn't drink anything, but he posed for photos with fans for about 30 minutes. Then the three friends took a stroll around the MGM Grand's casino where Galavis posed for more photos with anyone who would request it.

After several recent controversial comments , Galavis has become a polarizing figure among The Bachelor fans. Some call him the worst Bachelor ever while others think he's just honest and possibly misunderstood because of his Spanish language barrier.
After an eventful season, Galavis will choose between his two finalists, Clare and Nikki , on Monday night, and will most likely propose to one of them, given that it all goes well. However, as with many seasons before this one, several rumors have claimed that the current Bachelor does not propose to anyone at the end of the show.

No one likes  Juan Pablo Galavis  this season, as the Bachelor is getting ripped by all of the women and even  guys from other seasons  are saying that he is using the women on the show for fame.
Chris Bukowski, from  Emily Maynard  s Bachelorette season has given his opinion on the  Venezuelan charmer  and he doesn t have a very high one of him.

 I m not convinced any of those girls are going to be his future wife,  Chris told  Cupid s Pulse  about Juan Pablo.
The ABC reality show star has come under fire from the women he tried to romance, with Andi telling him off and everyone else ganging up on him during the Women Tell All special, and his actions are what worry Chris too.
 I think he s using the show as a way to enjoy himself and probably get himself out in the public eye,  he said.

As for his own love life, Chris says he isn t tied down to anyone right now.
 I am the most single person in America,  but that he s ready for love with the right girl.
 I love the fairytale endings.

 Bachelor  Finale Winner Predictions: Who Will Juan Pablo Pick? Plus Watch Clare Pick Out A Wedding Song [VIDEO]

Close
The most controversial season of  The Bachelor  is finally coming to a close on tonight s highly anticipated finale, but before we get rolling on our countdown and predictions there is a new piece of Juan Pablo evidence that we must consider. The evidence is a recently released deleted scene from season 18 of ABC s hugely popular dating series, and the two subjects in the scene are none other than Juan Pablo and Clare, and like the rest of this couple s alone time the moment captured on film is tender and romantic.
The competition has come down to just two women, Clare and Nikki, and tonight s finale episode will have Juan Pablo choosing one of them to marry while the other one just sent home with just her bags in tow. But way back before the competition was narrowed down so severely Juan Pablo and Clare made waves in the literal waves by becoming the first  Bachelor  couple to how should we say this, take a  dip in the ocean  so early on in the competition. They were immediately attracted to each other from the gecko with the pair enjoying the first intimate one-on-one date for the season. During the date, Juan Pablo and Clare enjoyed a private concert from Josh Krajcik. Like many other couples after enjoying his music and show, they have come to consider Krajcik s  No Better Lovers  their song. Before listening to it in the tender moment that was deleted from the season, they have danced to it before during another one-on-one date.
Juan Pablo plays the sweet song off his cell phone while the pair are just lounging on the couch, the thoughtful gesture takes Clare by such surprise that she even begins to cry. The pair does begin their signature make out, with a bit of candid lip-syncing in between, before Clare announcing,  We should just play it when we get married.  While Juan Pablo does not immediately respond to her request for the wedding song, he does belt out a cute  baby  right in tune with the song, so we are assuming he agrees.
Juan Pablo and Clare made an instant connection on season 18 of "The Bachelor." The blonde beauty made JP laugh immediately upon meeting him out of the limo by playing a pregnant joke on him. ABC
Obviously we are basing our assumption of who Juan Pablo picks off of spoilers, and while the king of TV spoilers Reality Steve claims that JP ends up picking Nikki Ferrell in the final rose ceremony, this exclusive video is making us second guess. JP and Clare had an immediate connection, and the pair are obviously attracted to each other physically, what we thought was lacking was their emotional connection . However, after watching them relaxing together and then JP produce a romantic surprise for Clare, we are thinking that these two are more in love than we first assumed. Clare obviously feels comfortable enough to openly discuss marriage with him, so much so that she is already planning the playlist.

Thanks to extensive spoilers announced over a course of several months, we know that Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley are the two finalists  to win the Bachelor. Oh, who are we kidding? We knew it was Nikki since before the show even started, thanks to the spoilers populating the Internet. It just proves   the Bachelor may look unscripted, but there are things on the show that are decided by the network brass long before the fans even get a look in.
It s now been a few months of Juan Pablo  searching for love , a.k.a. being a douche to the contestants and becoming the most hated Bachelor to ever grace our television screens. Although he s sent home contestant after contestant every week on the show, Reality Steve has already confirmed that Nikki Ferrell will win the show, much before it even premiered. Since she did, indeed, end up in the final two, it s hard to imagine that all the spoilers were inaccurate.
Nikki s attitude and behavior might have also raised eyebrows, and nobody suspected that she would manage to make it to the final two   but alas, here she is. So even if the show is rigged, at least its consistent? Clearly, the brass doesn t change its mind if they ve decided that someone is going to win the show.
However, with that being said, rumors have been abounding about the possibility of NO proposal at the end of this season. Not only that, but Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell apparently broke up months ago   either that, or Juan is still dating her as well as numerous other women at the same time. So in other words, this whole Bachelor season has been completely pointless.

The Bachelor 2014 Finale Predictions: Who Gets The Final Rose?
Posted By: Gossip & Gab on:

In: Celebrities , News No Comments
The end of everything has to come eventually and tonight marks The Bachelor 2014 Finale and the end of us seeing The Bachelor Juan Pablo shirtless every week talking about his love of his daughter and himself, but the big question of the night is who gets the final rose from Juan Pablo tonight on The Bachelor Season 18 Finale? The Bachelor 2014 spoilers might have me believe that it is Nikki Ferrell that he proposes to , but I may believe somewhere in that crazy brain in my head that Clare Crawley still has a shot at taking home that diamond ring!
To me, this is a toss-up and not because I think both of the women are good for Juan Pablo, but because I think this whole season is a joke. You could see that last week on The Bachelor 2014 Women Tell All special and the women ganging up to attack Juan Pablo and not attack each other! They said it (and I agree with them), but they don t think Juan Pablo was genuine in his search for a wife and stepmother to his daughter Camila.
So, whoever does win The Bachelor 2014 tonight, do we think they will still be together a month from now, if they are ever still together today? I don t think so, but I am picking Nikki Ferrel to win The Bachelor Season 18 tonight and then moving on to date Jef Holm this summer!
Who do you think wins The Bachelor 2014 tonight?

Viewers can watch The Bachelor finale live online and see whether Juan Pablo Galavis picks Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell   or maybe neither.
This season of the popular ABC reality dating show has been particularly noteworthy, and Galavis has garnered headlines for his controversial statements off the show and questionable behavior on it. Last week contestant Andi took herself out of the running after a fantasy suite date with Juan Pablo turned ugly.
Andi accused the Bachelor of caring only about himself, and not putting in the time to learn even the most basic details about her.
The season will come to an end Monday at 8 pm ET, when Juan Pablo will pick between the remaining two women, Clare and Nikki.
Viewers who watch The Bachelor finale live online will get to see if there are any fireworks to end the memorable season. The show s host, Chris Harrison, has said Juan Pablo has generated more interest than any other Bachelor he can remember, and not for all good reasons. Some outlets have painted him as the  most disliked Bachelor of all time. 
Harrison said he doesn t know if that s true, but does admit that Juan Pablo is a big draw with viewers .
 I don t know how you answer that,  Harrison says.  Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven t that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor . People want to follow Juan Pablo because he s unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions. 
Viewers can watch The Bachelor finale live online thanks to ABC s Watch Live function. The live streaming video may not be available in all areas, but for those who miss out on Monday the show will be put online within a day of airing.

Welcome to the Daily Buzz, a quick and pithy rundown of the stories people are talking about:
Police stumble on two 16-year-olds burying classmate's body in woods; both teens charged with homicide: Chilling?
It s a scene out of some mob movie   burying a body in the woods late at night.
Only, police in Wylie, Texas, say they came upon just this scene involving two 16-year-olds over the weekend. And when the officers asked the boys what they were doing in the woods on that Saturday night, one responded, chillingly:
"We are burying a body."
According to CNN, police found the body of 17-year-old Ivan Mejia of Wylie in the woods northeast of Dallas they. The two 16-year-olds, classmates of the victim, have been charged with homicide.
CNN reported that police first became interested when they checked out a suspicious, unoccupied vehicle backed up to the treeline, according to a department statement. Officers went into the woods, and spotted two suspects running from the area.
Police then returned to the car, and the 16-year-olds walked up and answered the question that set off immediate suspicion among the officers.
Get more details on this chilling crime and check out a video in the case here.
Daughter, 13, allegedly lured mom into garage so boy, 15, could cut her throat: Should they be charged as adults?
There is so much more to this story than the few facts being reported as this hour   like what is going on with these two teens caught up in an alleged plot to kill the young girl s mother. But even the scarce details are shocking.
It comes out of Ocala, Florida, where police say a 13-year-old girl allegedly lured her mom into the family garage, where a boy, 15, allegedly waited to cut the mom s throat. All this, according to CNN.
The Marion County Sheriff's Office said the boy slit the woman s throat, then the husband, and father of the girl, heard commotion and went to check on the garage.
The boy allegedly put a knife to the dad s throat, as well. But the father pleaded for his life and the teens permitted him to take his injured wife to the hospital, CNN reported.

'Bachelor' Juan Pablo Galavis: Love him or loathe him? Why this season, concluding tonight, is so controversial
There is no doubt about it. Juan Pablo Galavis is the most controversial "Bachelor" ever. (See videos below.)
But the question remains, has the good-looking lightning rod been good or bad for the ABC show, which holds its three-hour finale at 8 p.m. tonight?
On one hand, as a Fox News think piece notes, there's been a "ton of negativity" surrounding this season of "The Bachelor." And fans haven't been shy about sharing their distaste for Season 18 star Juan Pablo.
But if Juan Pablo is turning off fans; they sure aren't turning off their TVs. Instead, they are talking about the infuriating cut-throat Casanova. So much so, TV types are dubbing it one of the most talked-about seasons in the series' 14-year history.
Find out how readers are reacting and weigh in on the Juan Pablo debate here.
Man convicted of murdering 7 people in a diner wins $500K lawsuit over tussle with prison guard: Justice?
Don t spend it all in one place. Such is the usual advice for someone coming into a nice sum of money.
But that advice might not apply to James Degorski. He is a prison inmate serving life in prison for the 1993 murder of seven people at a suburban Chicago restaurant.
And although Degorski just came into a cool $500,000   his award in in a civil lawsuit in which he alleged a jail guard punched him in the face   he just might have to spend it all in one place. As in prison.
Or, he might not get to spend much of it at all.
Already, the civil award for Degorski is stirring controversy. Victims' relatives Sunday criticized jurors' decision, according to the Associated Press.
"If broken bones are worth a half-million, then how much are seven lives worth? This just doesn't feel right," said Ann Ehlenfeldt, a sister of Richard Ehlenfeldt, one of the owners who was killed, according to AP.
Get the background on the inmate s crimes and learn whether he will be able to spend any of that money.

So for good or for bad, Juan Pablo just seems to push everyone's buttons.

Will it actually happen and will we have a happy ending on The Bachelor 2014? That is yet to be determined, but we do have a sneak peek of The Bachelor 2014 finale for you to check out in our The Bachelor 2014 spoilers video below!
Last week on The Bachelor Season 18 , we took a week off from all the action during the taping of the season and had the Women Tell All special. The eliminated women on The Bachelor 2014 took to the stage to sit down with Bachelor host Chris Harrison to dish on things we didn t see. What didn t we see? Well, it seems like all of the women were not impressed with Juan Pablo and how he did not seem genuine in wanting to be there! Jilted exes? I would say the very least. It got harsh at times and I almost felt bad for Juan Pablo, which is hard for me to even type!
Tonight on The Bachelor 2014, his journey comes to an end and the final decision is made. Will it end in Juan Pablo getting down on one knee and proposing to his future wife? Which women (Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell) will go home with a broken heart? Check out the sneak peek here:

'The Bachelor' Finale Prediction: Who Should Juan Pablo Choose?
Monday, March 10, 2014
I would be lying if I said I had predicted Clare and Nikki would wind up in the final two on season 18 of The Bachelor.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised. He clearly has a type--feisty blondes with a bitchy streak.
So who should Juan Pablo choose for his wife: Clare or Nikki? I weigh the pros and cons of each lady and give my recommendation below.
Pros of Choosing Clare
Clare is a hairdresser, which means free haircuts for Juan Pablo and Camila...not to mention he'll have someone to style Camila's hair for dance recitals that fall on Daddy Weekends.
Clare's mom speaks Spanish and likes Juan Pablo.
He's already sampled the goods. In the hot tub, in the ocean, and in the Fantasy Suite.
They have excellent chemistry.
At 32, she's older and wiser than Nikki, which hopefully means she actually does want to settle down and have a family.
Hairdressers have a flexible work schedule. More time to dance and play soccer with Juan Pablo.
She says in her bio that her favorite snack is fruit, making her an excellent healthy eating role model for Camila.
Cons of Choosing Clare
Marrying Clare means marrying into a family of six daughters (including annoying sister Laura) and their mother...lots of estrogen at family gatherings.
She's a wuss about trying new foods, and Juan Pablo is adventurous when it comes to cuisine.
Clare is the baby of the family. She is high-maintenance and used to getting what she wants.
Clare has a definite bitchy side. I could easily see her not getting along with Camila's mother Carla.
They would have to travel to Sacramento to see Clare's family on holidays.
Pros of Choosing Nikki
Nikki is low-maintenance. Sometimes it doesn't even look like she brushes her hair.
Her family is shockingly normal.
Nikki has already met Camila and it went well.
She is a pediatric nurse. Having her around could drastically reduce the amount of money spent on kiddie doctor visits.
Cons of Choosing Nikki
Her bio lists her favorite type of dancing as "drunk dancing." Juan Pablo doesn't like drunk ladies (or so he told Victoria.)
She has a hideous upper back tattoo, and Juan Pablo lives in Miami. Can't take her to beach parties.
Nikki has a bitchy side that Juan Pablo has never seen. It's possible that she could be a wicked stepmother to Camila.
Nurses have demanding work schedules.
Nikki's curls wouldn't do well in the Miami heat.
Prediction
Juan Pablo has repeatedly said that he is looking for a stepmother for Camila. If that is true, then he should choose Clare. She is more mature and would be a better role model for Camila.
Nikki is still too young and crazy. I'm not convinced she is ready to be a wife and mother. Still, I think Juan Pablo will end up choosing Nikki. He hasn't seen her mean streak and she has less emotional baggage than Clare. All he sees when he looks at Nikki is a sweet, innocent pediatric nurse who won't fuss about eating octopus.
The Bachelor season 18 finale airs Monday, March 10 at 8pm on ABC.

After a season full of tears, catfights and early departures, Bachelor Juan Pablo handed out his final rose tonight, and it went to Nikki. But there was no proposal or "I love you" from JuanPabs.
Since Jen Steer and Chris Fedor have followed every awkward moment from the beginning, they live blogged during the show.
The last time we saw these contestants, they were in St. Lucia for their one-on-one dates and time in the Fantasy Suite.
Clare confessed her love for Juan Pablo, by eloquently saying,  Honestly, like, I'm just loving like falling in love with you." Then the pair spent most of the night making out in the hot tub.
District attorney Andi had fun during the day with Juan Pablo while playing a pick-up soccer game then picnicking in forest. But her time in the Fantasy Suite made her realize Juan Pablo knew absolutely nothing about her.
Nikki and JP went horseback riding. Later, she told the Bachelor she loves him.
 I didn t know that,  Juan Pablo replied.
Before the rose ceremony, Andi called Juan Pablo out on his crap and decided to leave the show.
 There s a difference between being honest and being an a**hole," Andi said.
 The Bachelor  finale aired Monday on ABC with the one-hour  After the Final Rose  special set to follow. Be sure to follow along with Jen and Chris in the comments section.

Nikki or Clare? Clare or Nikki?
We're hours away from finding out.
The conclusion of what has become a gripping Bachelor season airs tonight on ABC, Juan Pablo Galavis as chooses between two women who both hope to find their perfect fairy tale ending.
Will Nikki get the final rose? Will Clare cry tears of joy? Or will Juan Pablo pull a Brad Womack and choose neither, a possibility that seems more and more likely as his family says below that the star is "pretty much" ready to settle down.
Not exactly a ringing endorsement, is it?
You still have time to watch The Bachelor online if you need to catch up and then you can watch the following promo:
Who do you hope Juan Pablo chooses?

Tonight's TV picks: Will 'Bachelor' end in fireworks?
By
# Comments
WATCH THIS:

The Bachelor Season 18 comes to a gripping conclusion tonight, when Juan Pablo Galavis gets down on one knee and pops the question to his soulmate.
Or not. But someone will win the final rose, FWIW.
Barring a stunning development in which Juan pulls a Brad Womack and picks no one this evening either Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley will win Season 18.
We could actually see that happening, for sure, but The Bachelor spoilers indicate he does in fact choose someone. But who? And how? And does it last?
For those details, just read on, The Bachelor fans ...
So will Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley become Juan Pablo's wife? We're going to go ahead and say no and no, based on what we know of this guy.
That said, Galavis does choose one woman over the other:
Nikki Ferrell will walk away as your winner this evening.
The most controversial and least popular Bachelor ever has been accused of not taking this so seriously, and according to Reality Steve, doesn't propose.
According to inside sources, Galavis is still "hurt" after getting dumped by Andi Dorfman and "doesn't necessarily find his soul mate with Clare and Nikki."
It is speculated that Juan Pablo and the winner "left as a couple" after the St. Lucia season finale, but there are no engagement or marriage plans. At all.
So are they still together, since that was October?
Rumors have suggested that when the After The Final Rose special airs tonight, we'll learn that they aren't even together after the "journey" we just watched.
Not necessarily, the latest reports indicate.
They are still together as of the ATFR taping, and not only that, the producers are trying to convince Juan Pablo Galavis to propose on the broadcast!
Think he will? We have serious doubts.
The Bachelor spoilers and predictions have been accurate this season, so we're still anticipating a very short lived relationship between Juan Pablo and Nikki Ferrell.
Still, we've been wrong before, more than once, and until you watch The Bachelor online (or live), you'll ever know with 100 percent certainty what happens.
UPDATE: It's over! Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo Galavis are a couple!
That's right, a couple. She got the rose, but he didn't propose.
Clare Crawley got the boot, and Nikki won. But that's it.
A quick rundown on the season finale:
He told Nikki that he had a ring in his pocket, but he's "not gonna use it" because he's "not 100 percent" sure he wants to marry her, but "I like you a lot."
Somehow, she accepted the final rose anyway.
He told Clare something so offensive that she won't even repeat it on the program and she can't even bear the thought of talking to him again.
His big "surprise" was that they are still together!
He won't say "I love you," but they're a couple.
We think. They don't seem to have any plans.
He seems like kind of a jerk to be honest.
As for whether Juan and Nikki have any sort of future, we'll have to wait until the After the Final Rose special, and likely a long time beyond that, to find out ...
Juan Pablo and Nikki: Will it last?
Yes. Forever and ever. They are made for each other.
Maybe for awhile. Don't count them out.

'The Bachelor' Season 18 Finale Spoilers: Who Will Juan Pablo Galavis Choose - Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell?
The season finale of "The Bachelor" is just a few hours away and fans of the show are eagerly waiting to see who Juan Pablo Galavis might choose as his partner - Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley.
March 10, 2014 16:52 IST
The BachelorFacebook/TheBachelor
The season finale of "The Bachelor" is just a few hours away and fans of the show are eagerly waiting to see who Juan Pablo Galavis might choose as his partner - Nikki Ferrell or Clare Crawley.
Rumor has it that Ferrell will be the last one standing, as Galavis seemingly made his choice clear when he introduced the pediatric nurse to his daughter and former partner in one of the earlier episodes. The fact that only Ferrell's family seemed to embrace Galavis is a point in her favor.
But Crawley, too, appears to have a strong hold on Galavis, as the duo was seen discussing their wedding song in one of the deleted episodes.
In the clip, Galavis is seen taking out his cell phone, making Crawley feel that he is going to take a selfie. But the bachelor plays Josh Krajcik's "No Better Lovers," which immediately bring tears to Crawley's eyes.
"I love this song," Crawley says before kissing Galavis, who in turn comforts crying Crawley saying: "We started like that. Don't cry."
Crawley then tells him that they should play the song when they get married. The former Venezuelan soccer did not respond to the suggestion, instead just kissed her.
Later, during a confessional interview, Crawley said that she became emotional as she was caught up in the moment.
"I am lost in the moment. That song is how I feel and how I felt."
"Juan Pablo has definitely helped to break down those walls that have been up around my heart," she added.
Meanwhile, Reality Steve, a blogger who said Ferrell would be crowned the winner much before the current season premiered on ABC, is sticking to his prediction. But he notes that there might not be an engagement when the show ends.
"Juan Pablo and Nikki left Saint Lucia as a couple, but not engaged. First time in 10 seasons, there hasn't been a proposal at the end," Steve writes in his  blog . He also added that there is a monetary offer for Galavis to propose to Ferrell on the "After the Final Rose" show.
It remains to be seen if Steve's prediction will prove to be accurate.
The season finale of "The Bachelor" will be telecast on Monday at 8 pm on ABC.

NBC puts kids front and center in 'Believe' and 'About a Boy'
The Lowell Sun
Updated:   03/10/2014 07:43:26 AM EDT
NBC KIDS: Johnny Sequoyah, above, stars in Believe Monday night at 10, and Benjamin Stockham, right, stars in the sitcom About A Boy Tuesday at 9 p.m.
Sun staff photos can be ordered by visiting our Smugmug site.
The Bachelor -- ABC, Monday, 8 p.m.
Will Juan Pablo Galavis walk away with a wife?
Or really, will ABC let him?
The show has set up Juan Pablo as too much of an idiotic, insensitive villain and endured too many feminist online think-pieces to allow its protagonist any modicum of satisfaction.
My hopeful prediction? He will ask Clare to marry him, and she says no.
And then he will ask Nikki to marry him -- and she says no, too.
And The Bachelor will never be as good again.
Believe -- NBC, Monday, 10 p.m.
You know that TV has really expanded its cultural cache when the newly crowned best director at the Academy Awards follows up one of the year's biggest movie hits with a network television show.
jamin Stockham stars in the sitcom About A Boy Tuesday on NBC at 9 p.m.
Alfonso Cuar n, the visionary behind Gravity, brings this story to television about a girl with some sort of super powers. She better go into space at some point.
About a Boy -- NBC, Tuesday, 9 p.m.
Whatever happened to Hugh Grant, anyway? They couldn't have gotten him to just be on this show?
Parenthood -- NBC, Thursday, 10 p.m.
Parenthood deserves a little love.
It's on at a weird time, and it's very much a feel-good family show, much like showrunner Jason Katims' previous show, the masterful Friday Night Lights. (Katims also developed About A Boy).
But Parenthood has a massive and talented cast, with a bunch of not-too-recognizable faces acting out situations that anyone can relate to. And cute kids!

NCAA Basketball Tournament Selection Show -- CBS, Sunday, 6 p.m.
The NCAA Tournament is about to begin, which means it's time to study up on all our favorite colleges, like Weber State, Creighton and Stephen F. Austin State.
St. Patrick's Day Breakfast -- NECN, Sunday, 10 a.m.
Boston politicians like Gov. Deval Patrick and new Mayor Marty Walsh come together to roast each other in South Boston.
Don't worry -- Lowell's version of this is better.
South Boston St. Patrick's Day Parade -- NECN, Sunday, 12:30 p.m.
Thousands of well-behaved people will line the streets of Southie for the annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, which celebrates the strong resolve of the most accepting, progressive group of previously persecuted people there is: the Irish Catholics.

Tensions Run High Ahead Of "Bachelor" Finale (Sort Of)
Tensions Run High Ahead Of "Bachelor" Finale (Sort Of)
the bachelor
Things are getting intense before the final episode.
Tonight, TV viewers across the land will be able to breathe a sigh of relief as ABC s the bachelor comes to an end. But not before three intense hours, during which Juan Pablo is to select his one and only ladylove   if any of the candidates still want him by that point, of course.
How much damage has Galavis' reputation suffered since the Women Tell All episode?
For diehard fans of the show, EW published a deleted scene on Saturday   presumably to tide them over until the finale. It features Pablo and would-be girlfriend Claire, getting cozy on a sofa (get your mind out of the gutter) and sharing a tender moment, set to Josh Krajcik s No Better Lovers.
During the tender moment, JP pulls out his phone, making Claire think he is about to take a selfie, romantic guy that he is. But he pulls a surprise move on her, playing No Better Lovers, at which point his ladylove practically melts into a puddle of happiness. A teary-eyed Claire proclaims:  We should play this at our wedding! 
Was that foreshadowing? Or maybe producers are just trying to lead fans off the scent? More importantly, does anybody really care? The Bachelor s season finale airs Monday, March 10, at 8 p.m. In the meantime, Juan Pablo has reportedly been spending some time in Vegas. According to People , the not-so-lovable bachelor was in Las Vegas over the weekend to catch the Jorge Linares vs. Nihito Arakawa boxing match at the MGM Grand Garden Casino.
CONGRATS to my BRO @JorgeLinares for that WIN tonight... pic.twitter.com/LovIklVxXl

'The Bachelor' Roundup: Juan Pablo Defends R-Word Joke, Rumored as the Worst Bachelor Ever?
Monday, March 10, 2014
Add as BuddyTV Friend  
Though not the most engaging Bachelor, Juan Pablo has been one of the most controversial love searcher not just because of the things he has done on the reality dating series but off-camera as well. After earning a huge backlash for his anti-gay remarks and a couple of negative feedback from his eliminated women as well as other reality stars from the ABC franchise, he's causing yet another wave of controversy just before the season 18 finale. Could his latest move earn him the title of the most hated Bachelor?
Juan Pablo's Twitter Controversy
The single dad recently came under fire for re-tweeting a fan who shared a crude joke about people with mental handicaps. The tweet said: "Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"
Juan Pablo re-tweeted the joke and added, "JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..." which earned him a lot of negative comments. 
While his tweet has since been deleted, he did defend himself on Twitter.
Juan Pablo said : "I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect."
"Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD," he added. "The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture."
Juan Pablo as the Worst Bachelor?
According to E! News , Juan Pablo might just go down as the worst Bachelor ever. Sources reveal that the cast and crew of the reality dating series are very much looking forward to conclude the season, which includes a lot of drama on and off camera.
"Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over," an insider revealed. "His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend. It has not been anyone's favorite, that's for sure."
"He's the worst bachelor ever," another source said.
But it looks like Juan Pablo has other things to worry about if there's any truth to the rumor that he and his winner have not been getting along. 
"Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath," a source revealed. "If they are together at the finale, it's probably just an act."
What do you think of Juan Pablo's Twitter controversy? Do you consider Juan Pablo as the worst Bachelor ever?

The Bachelor finale is set to air with Juan Pablo Galavis picking between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell, but spoilers indicate a twist ending to what has been an all-around controversial season.
Though Juan Pablo started out as a fan-favorite pick to serve as the latest Bachelor, some of his actions this season have worn thin with viewers. First there were remarks he made in January that having a gay Bachelor would be  too perverted,  a comment that prompted ABC to respond that  Juan Pablo s comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show s producers or studio. 
Then there have been instances on the show the paint him as a womanizer, including a fantasy suite date with Andi where Juan Pablo seemed not too interested in learning about her. That ended with Andi calling out Juan Pablo for his behavior before taking herself off the show.
The Bachelor finale spoilers indicate an even bigger twist to end the show.
[WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD]
For one, the blogger Reality Steve seems to think that Juan Pablo is more interested in himself than either of the two remaining women. While Steve does say that Juan Pablo ends up picking Nikki, but not actually proposing to her.
Steve, who has successfully predicted the ending of all but one season so far, wrote :
 Make no mistake about this season, and you can choose to believe me or not   this was a complete cash grab for Juan Pablo. He never had any interest in finding a wife on this show, or a step mother for Camila, or whatever else line of BS ABC will run at you all season. This guy wants to act, he wants to be in commercials, he wants to model, and he wants to be on Dancing with the Stars. Come the spring season, you can pretty much bet your a** that Juan Pablo will be on DWTS, even though he can t dance a lick. 
Reports from after The Bachelor finale seem to bolster the idea . In February, Juan Pablo was seen at a Miami Heat game with singer Mayra Veronica, with witnesses saying the two were acting very much like a couple.
Another source told Life & Style magazine that Juan Pablo has been seen cozying up with at least three different women since the show wrapped, and none of them were the final two women on the show. The source also said that Juan Pablo doesn t seem to have much direction in his life.
 The cash is running out   fast,  the show insider told Life & Style magazine.  Nobody seems to know how Juan Pablo makes a living. During the week he spends his time going to the gym or the beach. His life in Miami seems rather mundane. 
Fans who want to see if The Bachelor finale spoilers come true can tune in to the episode, which airs Monday at 8 pm ET on ABC.

By Paloma Torres | Mar 09 2014, 03:07PM EDT
Close
It can be said that Juan Pablo Galavis has been the most controversial bachelor. But he has also been named the   worst bachelor ever .  He has been causing drama behind the scenes of the show. A source even said "Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over . "His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici's wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine's special weekend." The source added that crew members and producers are ready for the season to end and they have never been so ready.
Multiple sources have said that there has been a lot of fighting between Juan Pablo and the winner of the show. The source added "Producers are hopeful that they'll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath. If they are together at the finale, it's probably just an act."
This has been one of the most talked about seasons in the history of the show despite the negativity and distaste towards Juan Pablo. Is he really the worst bachelor ever? Stay tuned to ABC on Monday March 10 at 8 p.m. to see who Juan Pablo will choose.
Juan Pablo loves soccer, as the women are well aware, and now ten of them will attempt to show off their soccer skills when they arrive at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, the home of the Los Angeles Galaxy. It is said that he is the worst bachelor ever. ABC

Ugh. Are you kidding me? I know we really shouldn't be all that shocked or anything, but Juan Pablo Galavis made another offensive comment , basically destroying any hope that was left of him actually having fans by the end of his season of The Bachelor.
He's pulled the language barrier card over and over again to dig himself out of sticky situations, and up until now, I've sort of bought the excuse. A little bit. (I mean, have you heard his English? It's really not great.)
But this time, he went and used the dreaded "R" word -- and I'm really not sure he's going to be able to recover from this one.
Here's how it all went down. Juan P. retweeted this "joke" that was posted by a fan.
Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you re f**king special to me, you re my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!
And then all hell broke lose, because his retweet was accompanied by, "JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT  "
(Wait. He loved it? I thought he didn't even understand it. Whatever.)
As you can imagine, people went nuts after seeing this -- but then he dug himself into an even deeper hole by trying to defend himself.
First he reminded everyone that English isn't his thing. And then he told people they need to chill out and "enjoy jokes and sarcasm." Then he followed up with this little gem:
In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect
  Juan Pablo Galavis  (@JuanPaGalavis) March 7, 2014
Relax? Um. Ok.
Let me see if I have this straight. According to Juan Pablo, referring to gay people as "more pervert" isn't offensive. And neither is calling someone a retard.
Got it. (Ess ok.)
At this point, the dude should probably just quit while he's ahead and skip the "After the Final Rose" special all together -- because he's going to be absolutely torn to pieces.
Heck, he might want to think about taking a little vaca from the U.S. at least until The Bachelorette starts and we have a new person to obsess over and loathe.
I hear Venezuela is nice this time of year. (Just a suggestion.)
Are you offended by Juan Pablo's latest comment?

In this edition of  crazy rumors regarding   The Bachelor ,'  we present something that may actually have a little bit of validity to it: A story regarding just how ready ABC and the show s producers are to move on from the whole Juan Pablo Galavis disaster. In between his attitude on the show and his feelings on homosexuality and the r-word (which stirred up a lot of conversation earlier this week online), the folks over at public relations have been working overtime. Also, you have the editors desperate to still try and show that he is a good guy that should actually be sought after.
According to a report from E! News , here are a laundry list of reasons why some powers that be are counting down the minutes until they can move forward and focus fully on   The Bachelorette   ( which is likely to star Andi Dorfman from this season).
1. The blatant statement from a source that most everyone involved  cannot wait for the season to be over. 
2. There are rumors already that he and the woman that he picked at the end of the show are not getting along, which would hardly come along as a surprise. We know that it behooves ABC if the two are still together for the live  After the Final Rose  special, but at the same time, there s a sadistic part of us interested more in a complete trainwreck where they break up in front of everyone. We don t want to see heartbreak, but at the same time, it s been hard to see how emotionally invested anyone really is with this season so far.
3. Producers were extremely upset over how Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici s wedding was at times overshadowed in the press by the comments Juan Pablo said about a gay Bachelor:  His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici s wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine s special weekend.  This quote sounds a little dramatic since the wedding special still seemed perfectly fine for the bride and groom, but maybe this quote is more of the smoking gun into why Juan Pablo, who was at one point invited to the wedding, was not in attendance.
You can get some more evidence about the disdain for Juan Pablo s decision-making from Chris Harrison here , as he chided him earlier this season for flip-flopping on Clare Crawley. We ll have more news soon, and if you want to get some of it via email, subscribe now for our CarterMatt Newsletter.

Season 18 of The Bachelor is coming to a close, in less than a week Juan Pablo will give the last rose to one of the final two contestants, Clare Crawley or Nikki Ferrell. Bachelor Nation has been tuning into the reality television show since January, and has watched Juan Pablo send home potential bachelorettes one by one, narrowing down his search for true love.
Blogger and Bachelor spy,  Reality Steve  announced pediatric nurse Nikki Ferrell would win this season of The Bachelor long before the season premiere on ABC. At first Bachelor fans thought he may be wrong after witnessing Nikki s negative attitude and rude comments , it was hard to believe Juan Pablo would want to spend the rest of his life with Ferrell, let alone another week. Weeks went by though, and everyone seemed to either be eliminated or quit on their own behalf , and before we knew it the season was nearly over and Nikki Ferrell was in the Final Two. So, it appears Reality Steve was right after all, Nikki Ferrell will win Season 18 of The Bachelor.
If you were hoping to see Juan Pablo get down on one knee and propose to winner Nikki Ferrell during the season finale, then you are going to be seriously disappointed. Rumor has it there was no proposal at the end of this season, the winner Nikki Ferrell and Juan Pablo broke up months ago ! They may take the cake for shortest Bachelor relationship ever. Since the season premiere of Season 18 of The Bachelor in January, Juan Pablo has been linked to numerous women, and none of them are Nikki Ferrell. If they are still together, then someone seriously needs to sit Nikki down and open her eyes to Juan Pablo s wandering eye.
Now that The Bachelor is almost over, how did you feel about Season 18? Were you as disappointed in Juan Pablo s stint as The Bachelor as everyone else was? Share your thoughts on this season of The Bachelor in the comment section below.

As  The Bachelor  season comes close to an end, some dramatic secrets are being revealed about Juan Pablo Galavis.
As  The Bachelor  season comes close to an end, some dramatic secrets are being revealed about Juan Pablo Galavis.
 Everyone on the show is just so over him and cannot wait for this season to be over,  said a source connected with the dating competition to E! News .  His anti-gay comment happened the weekend of Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici s wedding which completely overshadowed all the hard work everyone put in for it and practically ruined Sean and Catherine s special weekend. 
Apparently the producers and crew members of the ABC show are also fed up with the former soccer player and can t wait for the season to be over, saying that  he s the worst bachelor ever. 
 It has not been anyone s favorite, that s for sure,  said the source.
Multiple sources also revealed that there s been  lots of fighting  going on between Galavis and the woman he choses.
 Producers are hopeful that they ll work it out by the live finale, but no one is holding their breath,  said a source.  If they are together at the finale, it s probably just an act. 
Galavis most recently made a joke making fun of people with mental handicaps and defended his comment in a tweet then deleted it followed by a statement saying that people need to  relax  and  try to be happy and enjoy jokes and sarcasm. 
During Monday night s  Women Tell All  episode of  The Bachelor,  the woman teamed up to tear apart the bachelor rather than arguing amongst themselves.
Viewers learned that Renee has moved on, Sharleen doesn t regret walking out and Kelly, who has a gay father, was so offended by Galavis  gay comment she cried, however, they have all gotten over their love for the Latino hunk.
Some of the contestants felt that Galavis  wasn t genuine  and accused him of being shallow. Danielle complained that  a lot of our conversations were surface level  and Lauren S. said that he gave her the impression that he wasn t interested in her and the other women.
 He didn t really ask us a lot of questions about ourselves,  said Lauren.  I felt like he wasn t genuine.

Juan Pablo is once again the talk of town! This time, the ex-football player is being criticized for retweeting an offensive "retard" joke.
The tweet reads:
"Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f**king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"

According to Radar Online , the 32-year old has since deleted his retweet after being slammed online. It is reported that he also included "JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT!" in the RT, seemingly expressing his amusement.
But not everyone was amused by the f**k, retard and bastard-laden tweet, nor were they amused by Juan Pablo's "jajajajaja." The New York-born immediately defended his RT, citing his bad English as the culprit.
"I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture , he first tweeted .
"Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES..." he says in another tweet .
The father of one also cited cultural differences, saying that "retard" is commonly used in Venezuela.
"In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect ," he tweeted.
"Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture ," he added in another tweet.
It seems that The Bachelor star has only taken the RT lightly and was surprised at the backlash of netizens. He tells followers in another tweet , "People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM..."

In a sneak peek of The Bachelor finale, Juan Pablo's mom gave Clare a little insight on her son's "rudeness."
Clare Leaves Juan Pablo in Tears?
She began by asking Clare how she feels about the communication between she and Juan Pablo.
Clare responded, "I love it. We had a disagreement but we communicated and he made sure to say, 'This is how I feel' even if it's no what you want to hear."
Juan Pablo's mom then revealed that it is not unusual for him to be "very rude."
Clare then confessed that their altercation made her cry, but she still appreciates his honesty.
It definitely looks like she wouldn't mind being a part of Juan Pablo's family either.
She said, "...They all made me feel like I was at home and I couldn't wait to talk to them. I couldn't wait to share stories with them. I couldn't wait for them to tell me stories about Juan Pablo."
While Clare might enjoy Juan Pablo's honesty, the reality TV star has found himself in the midst of controversy  once again. He retweeted a message a fan wrote to him that made fun of people with mental handicaps.
The tweet read, "Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r--d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a [messed] up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"
Juan Pablo retweeted the post and added, "JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..." before deleting it.
A tweet he didn't delete was one that defended his actions. He slammed his critics and told them to educate themselves on other cultures.
He wrote, "I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and LITTLE bit of portuguese...For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN...#Culture. Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES...People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM...In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect."

He also told his followers they need to travel and see the world.
The Bachelor finale airs Monday March 10 at 9/8c on ABC.

Juan Pablo Galavis might be one of the most controversial "The Bachelor" contestants in the history of the show, and he proved it on Thursday by retweeting a joke about mentally handicapped people.
The message that Galavis decided to share with his followers has since been deleted, but not before it attracted the attention of the public.
"Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy!" the message read.
"Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals."
"You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"
Besides retweeting the message, Galavis also added "JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..." along with it. And, once criticism started to pour in, he attempted to defend the joke with a series of messages claiming that his English was weak.

Juan Pablo Stupid Tweets Ignorant Or Mean? Bachelor Slammed By Andi Dorfman And Other Contestants For Vicious Words (VIDEO)
By Staff Writer March 07, 2014 8:21 PM
Photo: ABC
After Juan Pablo introduced Nikki to his parents and daughter, Camila, fans started to wonder if the Bachelor had already made his final decision.
The Bachelor's final two Nikki Ferrell and Clare Crawley are being criticized today for their decision to fight for Juan Pablo Galavis. His offensive comments about the gay community, mentally ill people and contestant Andi Dorfman have upset fans of the ABC reality show more than almost any other Bachelor before. Juan Pablo's excuse? English is his second language, he says. 
Andi dumped Juan Pablo after a nightmare Fantasy Suite date in one of the most dramatic Bachelor exits we've ever seen. Heartbroken and fuming, Andi tried to explain to Juan Pablo that he wasn't getting it. She felt hurt and stupid after spending an evening with him and taking time off from her high-powered career as an assistant district attorney.
RELATED: 'Bachelor' Finale Shocker! Was Juan Pablo Faking It All Along?
In a somewhat vicious breakup, Andi slammed Juan Pablo saying she  can t stand" being with him. After laying in bed awake next to him as he slept, Andi realized Juan Pablo couldn't care less about her thoughts on religion or politics, she said.  It s important for me to be with a guy who loves me more than he loves himself. 
Andi showed her tough side while dumping Juan Pablo on 'The Bachelor.'
Andi's complaint about Juan Pablo is nothing new. All season, everyone but Nikki, Clare and Renee has called the Bachelor for being stupid, shallow, insensitive, hurtful and fake (not necessarily in that order). But are the criticisms of Juan Pablo just sour grapes because Clare and Nikki are the final two?
RELATED: 'After The Final Rose' Crazy! Was Juan Pablo On The Show To Find A Wife? 
That's what Bachelor host Chris Harrison was trying to figure out on the "Women Tell All" episode. "Clearly, Juan Pablo [is] an attractive man," Harrison told the contestants. "Why wasn't that enough?"
Andi was the first to respond, saying: "At the end of the day," she said. "Those looks can fade, and you need something more than that." 
L - R: Andi, Renee and Sharleen sat in the front row during the 'Women Tell All' episode, and they didn't mince words.
Sharleen, the opera singer who dumped Juan Pablo before Andi did, was surprisingly sweet when talking about Juan Pablo on the "Women Tell All". But even she admitted that the Bachelor has two personalities. When asked if it was wrong to blame Clare for hooking up in the ocean at 4:00 a.m., she said: "I think he had a case of buyer's remorse. He didn't man up the way he should have."
In the first three - four episodes of Season 18, it really seemed like Juan Pablo was too good to be true. Between his chiseled abs and adorable stories about his daughter, Camila, he seemed like the perfect package (no pun intended).
RELATED: The 'Women Tell All' On Heated Episode
But over time, as the contestants got to know the Bachelor better, they started to question his motives for being on the show. Andi wasn't sure he was really looking for a wife. Sharleen questioned whether he could have deep, "cerebral" conversations. Renee wondered why he would kiss other women and not her. 
Juan Pablo will give his final rose to Nikki or Clare, above, on this week's Bachelor finale.
Juan Pablo also seemed to backtrack on the Fantasy Suite date with Clare. She told him she was nervous about going to the Fantasy Suite because he said he didn't want to upset his daughter, Camila. This time   when the cameras would not be rolling in the hotel room   Juan Pablo changed his tune. He insisted this is how they would truly get to know one another. 
The buzz is that Juan Pablo and Clare did sleep together in the ocean, Fantasy Suite or both. Sleeping with contestants during filming has long been frowned upon. Many Bachelor fans feel that, because it's part of a television show and women are trying to win a competition, that sleeping with a woman is not only sleazy but also unfair. It creates an unfair advantage and pressure, they argue.
RELATED: Bachelor Hometown Dates Lead To Crazy Drama
The contestants also questioned Juan Pablo's decision to meet Renee's son, Ben, if he wasn't going to give her a rose. And many viewers thought it was terribly unfair to Camila   and the rest of the contestants   that the Bachelor introduced Nikki to her so early on.
Juan Pablo, seen here with Bachelor finalist Nikki, defended his R-word joke on Twitter.
He defended his decision by saying he often introduces people he's dating to Camila as "his friends." Moms everywhere still question whether the move was a good idea.
Now that we're at the end of a season filled with crying and catfights, Nikki and Clare are competing for a questionable prize. Even if Juan Pablo is, in fact, in it for the right reasons, he seems to misstep and change his words. It's hard to trust a man who says one thing and does another. Isn't it?

In January, he enraged Bachelor fans for saying that gay contestants should be banned because they're more 'pervert in a sense.'
Now Juan Pablo Galavis offended even more people on Thursday for retweeting an insensitive joke mocking the mentally disabled and using the 'R' word.
The 32-year-old reality star shared: 'Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy!

'You hang  in there cup cake, you re f***ing special to me, you re my friend, look  at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!'
The former footballer has since deleted his retweet, which included uproarious laughter: 'JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT!'
Impressionable: It makes one wonder whether the 32-year-old reality star is teaching this 'culture' to his four-year-old daughter Camila with ex-girlfriend, Carla Rodriguez
Juan  - a New York-born Venezuelan - then defended his actions by informing  his 278,000 followers that it's no big deal in his country.
'In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,' Galavis wrote.
'People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM.'

2014 Season 18  Bachelor  Juan Pablo Girls Spoilers: Winner Disappointed; Contestants Hate Galavis  Guts
By Shane Jordan s.jordan@classicalite.com on Mar 07, 2014 05:46 PM EST
2014 Season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo is without a doubt the most hated and disappointing lead the reality show has ever had. The contestants seem to hate Galavis for being disingenuous about seriously wanting to settle down. The crew thinks he is a womanizer, and the producers are tired of his total diva mentality. Spoilers: No matter which one of the girls is the winner; there is no ring to really win on this season's Bachelor.
An insider on the show told OK! that Galavis is universally disliked by all the behinds the scene staff, because of the way he treats everyone:
"The producers despise Juan Pablo! He was a total diva on set, throwing temper tantrums daily.
"A bad signal on his phone made him explode...Another time he almost reduced a junior runner to tears over cufflinks."
Another show production whistleblower told OK! that it wasn't just his behaviors, but his constant demands for more money that really had some people regretting ever greenlighting Juan Pablo for Bachelor :
"There's no doubt that he's in it for more fame. Love is not his number one goal.
"[Galavis] demanded more money than any other Bachelor contestant and wanted obscene amounts of per diem and free clothes."
It's all the concern for himself and no one else that has caused the genteel ladies to turn against him publicly claims a source in In Touch:
"The girls think he's an ass...Initially he comes across as very charming, but as you get to know him, you can tell he is not sincere.
"They want to humiliate him now."
But 2009 Bachelorette Jillian Harris thinks the world outside the set shouldn't be too quick to judge Galavis based solely by what they have seen on television (via OK! Magazine):
"[Juan Pablo] is really is different...He has very strong opinions, is stubborn and set in his ways.
"But I don't think he's got bad intentions."
Yeah whatever, he's a slut.

He Put His Foot In His Mouth AGAIN! 'Bachelor' Juan Pablo Makes R-Word Joke, Tells Fans To 'Open Your Mind' And 'Learn Culture'
Mar 7, 2014 @ 13:31PM
If Juan Pablo Galavis is trying to become the most-hated Bachelor  yet, it s working.
Hot on the heels of homophobic comments he made in January that enraged the public, Juan has done it again   this time mocking the mentally disabled.
On Thursday Juan Pablo retweeted an insensitive joke made by a fan that read:
 Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f**ked up friend, just as I ve done. I don t care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you re f**king special to me, you re my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you! 
Not only did the controversial 32-year-old retweet the offensive message , but he then replied to it.
 JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT   he wrote   and then later deleted after being slammed with criticism by the public.
Juan then tried to defend himself on Thursday, claiming his poor English was to blame.
I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese  For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN  #Culture
  Juan Pablo Galavis  (@JuanPaGalavis) March 6, 2014
Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES

He even went on to claim that in his home country of Venezuela,  retard  is not an offensive word.
In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone  #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect

But the damage is done, and coupled with his stance that the Bachelor should never have a gay contestant because  homosexuals are more  pervert in a sense,  the former soccer pro has quickly become one of the franchise s most criticized contestant to date.
The season finale of The Bachelor airs on Monday, March 10.

The Season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo has landed himself in hot water multiple times over his  language barrier.  Considering how much trouble he has had with his gay slurs and social media mistakes , one can only imagine how many times Chris Harrison and the Bachelor production team had to edit their video footage and reshoot conversations after correcting his language barrier issues. Although this season has been by far one of the worst seasons of The Bachelor is several years, they did manage to produce an epic Bachelor blooper real courteous to Juan Pablo s issues with the English language.
Now that Season 18 of The Bachelor is coming to an end, never-before-aired scenes are beginning to emerge all over the internet. Entertainment Weekly just released a clip of Juan Pablo and Chris Harrison arguing over why Andi Dorfman walked out on him after their disastrous Fantasy Suite date.
After Juan Pablo got slammed by Andi and dumped, Chris Harrison asked him what happened. According to Juan Pablo Andi,  wasn t feeling it.  Harrison, The Bachelor host tried to explain to Juan Pablo why Andi was upset with him, and how she felt like he didn t care about her feelings or have any interest in getting to know her. It sounds like all Juan Pablo got out of his conversation with Andi after their break-up was,  she say why I say default and I don t say default. 
Props to Chris Harrison for putting up with Juan Pablo and his alleged language barrier for an entire season of The Bachelor, would you have been able to be that patient with the arrogant Bachelor?

Juan Pablo Defends R-Word Twitter Joke And Urges  The Bachelor  Fans To  Learn Culture  [VIDEO]

Juan Pablo is in hot water again, however this time it s due to his antics with the women of  The Bachelor.  JP, who has sky rocketed to fame as the first Latino  Bachelor  finds himself at the center of another controversy when he retweeted a fan on Thursday that wrote a rather thoughtless joke on the social media site, the joke was poking fun at people who suffer from mental handicaps, and plainly was just insensitive . The joke, which to clarify was not written by Juan Pablo, but was retweeted to his Twitter profile read, "Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r-----d can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!" After posting the tactless poem to his profile, Juan Pablo added  "JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT..." however since the backlash his comment of intense laughter and praise has since been deleted.
After receiving an angry barrage of messages via Twitter, Juan Pablo went back on the site in an effort to defend himself writing, "I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK English and a LITTLE bit of Portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture." The star of ABC s hugely popular dating seris continued his rant stating, "Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect." What Juan Pablo is perhaps missing is that not only was his word choice offensive, the indication that all those with mental disability lack the competence to read and not feed themselves crayons is just completely outlandish. Juan Pablo needs a stern lesson in the way of the world, and even is defense of his tweet was lacking claiming the difference in language to be the major cause for concern. The implication and insensitive nature of the joke is offensive, in addition to his use of the r-word.
Juan Pablo s apology /defense of this joke continued throughout the day with the singe dad also tweeting, "Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture." His hastags may be the most telling pat of this apoplgy, which truly shine light on the issue of jokes of this nature. By urging most likely Americans and fans of The Bachelor  to  learn culture  Juan Pablo should take a piece of his own advice and realize that America is a very politically correct country that actively works to openly accept all people. Moreover the insistence to  open your mind  is truly laughable considering Juan Pablo himself is too ignorant to see what hurtful words and comments can do to those who are perhaps already suffering. Do I think he intentionally meant to offend anyone? No-but he should perhaps take some of his own advice and open his mind to the culture of the US and learn acceptance. 
Juan Pablo is in hot water again, however this time it s due to his antics with the women of  The Bachelor.  Find out why fans of ABC's hugely popular dating series are criticizing JP after a joke he retweeted on Twitter. ABC

Is Juan Pablo the Worst Bachelor Ever? And Does It Even Matter?

Juan Pablo Galavis
It's no secret there's been a ton of negativity surrounding this season of  The Bachelor . But while fans, celebrity and otherwise, have shared their distaste for Season 18 star  Juan Pablo , it's also been one of the most talked-about seasons in the series' 14-year history. Which begs the question: Does a detested Bachelor actually make for a more successful season?
The Bachelor: Where are they now?
When host  Chris Harrison   announced  on  The Bachelorette 's After the Final Rose special in August that Juan Pablo was the franchise's newest star, the immediate reaction was mixed. Fans seemed excited to finally have a minority Bachelor, but Juan Pablo was also viewed by some as a questionable choice. Unlike past seasons that starred a previously rejected contestant, viewers knew very little about Juan Pablo. Eliminated in Week 6 on The Bachelorette without having had a one-on-one date, all we really knew was that Juan Pablo was a former professional soccer player from Venezuela with a 4-year-old daughter. How would he interact with women one-on-one on camera? How would he handle himself in interviews? How was he with his daughter? The only thing anyone knew with relative certainty: Juan Pablo was sexy, which, to be fair, is a very important characteristic when choosing the lead.
"You have to go with how you feel at the time and the information you have at the time, and, for us, Juan Pablo was easily the best choice at the time," Harrison tells TVGuide.com. Prior to the announcement, TVGuide.com users certainly agreed with that sentiment, as Juan Pablo  received 40 percent  of nearly 10,000 votes cast about who should be the next Bachelor. 
The Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy
Heading into the January season premiere, ABC played up Juan Pablo's Latin background with its "Juan-uary" promos. The network even announced three Sunday specials, culminating in a  three-year ratings high  for the show's premiere. But then came controversy. Just before the third episode, Juan Pablo  infamously said in an interview  that he didn't think the show should have a gay or bisexual star because gay people were "more pervert." The soundbite made headlines everywhere, and angry viewers and non-fans alike tweeted their disgust. Juan Pablo  posted an apology , but the dust never really settled.
A couple weeks later, viewers were talking about Juan Pablo's  late-night swim  with  Clare , which Juan Pablo later used to shame her. (He claimed he regretted the seemingly innocent rendezvous.) Towards the end of the season, another oddity occurred: Contestants left the show because they couldn't see a future with Juan Pablo. Whereas during most seasons the rejected women cried hysterically upon their eliminations, some of this season's ladies were honest in their lack of interest. Notably, opera singer  Sharleen  exited just before hometown dates saying, "There's a little voice in my head telling me that this is not right...The idea of proposal doesn't seem like something that is possible for me."
During fantasy suite week,  Andi  also left the show on her own accord, telling Juan Pablo that he had no respect for her, was immature, and couldn't care less about getting to know her. But, as is often the case, the supposed backlash against Juan Pablo actually translated to more buzz about the show. "I've done more interviews   random ones from Sports Radio to The New York Times   about this season and the controversy surrounding him, including the remarks off-camera," Harrison says. And perhaps even more telling, at the "Women Tell All" special, for the first time the fights weren't between the girls, but with the star. (Even the majority of TVGuide.com users for the first time, when asked if Juan Pablo should choose Nikki or Clare, chose  neither .)
The Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Andi would make a fantastic Bachelorette
But has Juan Pablo actually hurt the franchise? Consider last season's star  Sean Lowe , who was arguably the most liked Bachelor to date and who eventually married his winning contestant  Catherine  on an ABC special. But Sean's season had the lowest-rated premiere in the show's history and his finale garnered 10 million viewers, just a smidge ahead of  Ben Flajnik 's Season 16 finale, but less than Seasons 13, 14 and 15. (It's worth noting that, after an initial spike generated from Juan Pablo's insensitive comments, viewership has been steadily dropping. Perhaps the Olympics or the return of  The Voice  are to blame, or maybe viewers lost interest around the same time Sharleen and Andi did.) 
So, is Juan Pablo truly a "bad" Bachelor? "I don't know how you answer that," Harrison says. "Do you answer yes only if they go on and get married? Because there are plenty that haven't that were good too. I look at our fans; the ratings have been fantastic, the buzz around the show is insatiable and that makes for a good Bachelor. ... People want to follow Juan Pablo because he's unpredictable. People more and more want to talk about this and ask questions. Sean's decisions were cut and dry whereas Juan Pablo you're leaving scratching your head. So, a season like this draws you to discuss.
Bachelor's Chris Harrison breaks down hometowns, previews Andi's "nightmare" fantasy suite
"We need you to love the Bachelor or hate the Bachelor because we need you to have an opinion," Harrison continues. "Apathy is what kills us, when you just don't care what happens. With Sean, there weren't any negatives and it was just a matter of who the lucky lady was going to be. With Juan Pablo, it's how are we going to land this plane with no landing gear and the pilot is passed out? I like the fact that there are both ends of the spectrum here. All I hope for is for you to have an opinion about Juan Pablo. Some people love him and will defend him, but then there are those who can't stand him and he gets on their last nerve."
Despite the way his missteps have created buzz, Harrison insists that the producers didn't cast Juan Pablo to be a lightning rod. "We didn't go into Juan Pablo's season thinking this guy is going to be really controversial on- and off-camera," Harrison says. "We thought he'd be the Latin version of Sean. [We thought,] he's a good family man looking for love, and turns out he's not in the way Sean was."
So, looking back, would Harrison have done it differently? "I have no regrets about him being the Bachelor," Harrison says. "It's a very different season, and, in my opinion, not a bad season. He's not a bad guy. When you have a very specific Bachelor with a different culture, a somewhat different language, yes it's going to narrow down the field and the women who will fall for this guy. But I think it's been very interesting. I can't even explain what a different journey this was for me and our fans. We're on a roller coaster and we're all just hanging on for dear life and have no idea what's coming next."
The Bachelor's three-hour finale airs on Monday at 8/7c on ABC. What did you think of this season?

I've seen that joke many times and it's pretty old too. It's usually sent in a text msg chain that you send to your close silly for ends an it is funny and has NOTHING to do with disabled children. Where in that joke was a disabled child referenced??!! Trust me I know a lot of mentally "normal" people that are not children that lick windows and ear crayons! It's fucking funny and meant to be a joke to someone you call a dear friend that does retarded stupid shit. I will never tolarate someone bulling, disrespecting a child that has a mental disability or any child for that matter. I think anyone that would do something like that is completly disgusting but that is not the case in this situation. That's like if you ever called someone stupid out of joking or anger in your life you are making fun of diabled children right? Isn't it the same thing if that's what your saying about Juan Pablo??!! Give me a break! Leave the guy alone! Is daughter will be fine. It will probably affect his daughter in a more adverse way because of what you and all the other media are saying about her dad and her. Juan Pablo isn't my cup of tea but LEAVE HIM ALONE for Petes sake! It was a joke that had nothing to do with disabled children so leave it at that, laugh at it because it IS funny and move the fuck on! Geez!!!!

The tide will turn. The "machine" that is the show, started to socially construct him negatively by editing things out that were positive, and including things that fit the negative image they were trying to construct of him, in order to distance themselves from him after he made a misconstrued comment about homosexuality.  It's funny actually to watch all these second rate writers and web sites, and so called "celebrities" dominate the discussion and the rest of the puppets in the world eat it up as "truth". Juan Pablo has been bullied by all the things that were portrayed about him.  All this garbage about "worst bachelor ever" is pathetic. He was very respectful and kind to all the women. He didn't drink alcohol and encouraged them not to. He refused to do the two dates thing because he saw it as hurtful to the women. He was so sensitive and kind. He was funny. Just b/c he made a comment outside the show, all of a sudden, like a pack of wild dogs, the show and media turned on him and yes, bit by bit, with each disparaging comment, or cleverly constructed image, they tried to make him seem to be a villain. Shame on ALL of you. To be so readily taken in, to be so manipulated by the powers that be on the show/station; to not think critically about what has happened, is a sad reflection of the level of intelligence in the mainstream!

Juan Pablo Ridicules Mentally Handicapped, Says To  Respect  His Use Of The R-word
Posted on March 7th, 2014 at 8:30 am
- erin@rumorfix.com
Juan Pablo Galavis is under fire yet again after re-tweeting a fan s offensive joke about mentally handicapped people.
The following is what The Bachelor star found to be funny, tweeting it to his quarter of a million followers:  Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r****d can read, but look at you go, little buddy!   Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f ked up friend, just as I ve done.

You crayon eating bastard you! 
 JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT   JP added in his own words alongside the re-tweet.
Receiving a flurry of backlash on Twitter just minutes after his post, Galavis got heated, tweeting in his defense:
 I m BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese. For those who DON T I recommend to LEARN  #Culture.

Juan Pablo Galavis is solidifying his stance as the most-hated  Bachelor  star yet.
The Venezuelan-soccer-star-turned-reality-star came under fire again after he retweeted a post that mocked people with mental disabilities.
"Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every retard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! Today you should take a moment and send an encouraging message to a f--ked up friend, just as I've done. I don't care if you lick windows, or interfere with farm animals. You hang in there cup cake, you're f--king special to me, you're my friend, look at you smiling at your phone! You crayon eating bastard you!"
Galavis replied to the profanity-filled post, writing "JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT...," according to E! News.
Fans immediately took to social media, criticizing the star for the post, and the tweet has since been deleted.

 The Bachelor  recap: Juan Pablo meets the ladies, gets advice from Sean Lowe
Juan Pablo caused a stir back in January when he told a reporter he didn t think a gay or bisexual Bachelor would set a good example for kids because gays were more,  pervert, in a sense. 
The reality star attempted to rectify the situation by blaming the comments on a language barrier, saying that the word  pervert  in Spanish is not as offensive. He used the same excuse this time around, blaming his latest tweet on cultural differences.
 In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,  he wrote.  Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD... The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there... #openyourmind #learnculture 
He posted several other message stating that his English is not that great.
Galavis has been heavily criticized during his season on the ABC dating series, and two women have left the competition, proclaiming they didn t want to date him.  The Bachelor  finale airs next Monday night on ABC.

Juan Pablo Galavis has once again come under fire for being insensitive.
On March 6, the Bachelor star retweeted a fan who shared a joke that included a line that made fun of people with intellectual disabilities. When fans blasted him for using the word  r*tard,  he justified his actions by blaming the language barrier and a  cultural difference. 
The original joke read:  Not every flower can save love, but a rose can. Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r*tard can read, but look at you go, little buddy! 
Juan Pablo retweeted the fan, and wrote  JAJAJAJAJA LOVED IT   The 32-year-old has since deleted the message.

When one fan called him out telling him he s on an American-based show and that the term is considered a slur in the states he replied,  I m Venezuelan and Twitter is WORLDWIDE. 
Despite his ignorance on the subject, the former soccer pro continued to take the opportunity to tell people who were insulted by the use of the word to be more open minded.
 Some people need to TRAVEL and get around the WORLD,  he wrote.  The US is a GREAT country but there is a LOT out there.

The Bachelor 2014 Spoilers: Pick The Bachelorette 2014 (POLL)
Posted By: Gossip & Gab on:
March 07, 2014
In: Celebrities , News No Comments
Besides learning who gets the final rose from Juan Pablo on The Bachelor 2014 Finale next week, we will also learn who The Bachelorette 2014 will be during the After The Final Rose special with Chris Harrison (unless ABC switches it up and doesn t share the information with us yet) and despite what The Bachelor 2014 spoilers say, let s pick our selection for The Bachelorette 2014 in the poll below! Let your opinion be heard with all the other The Bachelor Season 18 fans out there!
We all know that the frontrunner seems to be Andi Dorfman, I mean, Reality Steve even predicted she is going to be it! That doesn t mean it is a done deal and some others couldn t be The Bachelorette Season 10, like Cassandra, Clare, Kat, Chelsie or even Sharleen from The Bachelor Season 18. That does not mean that The Bachelorette 2014 has to be from this current season, but we all know ABC likes to share among the shows.
It all depends on what happens at The Bachelor 2014 finale and who Juan Pablo picks as the winner and maybe the runner-up will move into the role as The Bachelorette 2014? I would like to see ABC switch it up and bring someone new and fresh into the show, like maybe the recently single Paula Patton, but that one would never happen!
So, who would you like to see as The Bachelorette 2014? Tell us in the poll:

Galavis went on to defend himself, tweeting , "I'm BLESSED to speak SPANISH, an OK english and a LITTLE bit of portuguese... For those who DON'T I recommend to LEARN... #Culture." He continued , "Yeap, an OK english, my WRITING is HORRIBLE but some of you already UNDESTAND me with all my MISTAKES... People, try to be HAPPY and enjoy JOKES and SARCASM... In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone... #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect."

NEWS: Why Dancing WIth the Stars didn't want Juan Pablo Galavis
In January, the soccer player came under fire after he said there shouldn't be a gay Bachelor because homosexuals are more " pervert in a sense ." Galavis later apologized for his interview quotes and blamed his word choice on a language barrier. ABC, Warner Horizon Television and the show's producers didn't defend Galavis, telling E! News, "Juan Pablo's comments were careless, thoughtless and insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the network, the show's producers or studio."

Recent immigrants who barely speak English seem to make fewer gaffes with the English language than American-born Juan Pablo Galavis.
 The Bachelor  star, who grew up in Venezuela, once again blamed his background after he came under fire for making light of offensive language. Galavis encountered a backlash after he retweeted someone apparently poking fun at the mentally handicap and who used the r word.
"Not every flower can save love, but a rose can,  said the tweet.  Not every plant survives thirst, but a cactus can. Not every r***** can read, but look at you go, little buddy! 
Galavis not only retweeted it, but he also wrote:  Loved it. 
Galavis brushed off the controversy, and blamed his poor choice of words on the fact that English is his second language.
 In Venezuela the R word is USED commonly and by NO means is to OFFEND anyone  #Relax #DifferentCulture #Respect,  he wrote on Twitter.
He later deleted the tweet, though he told his followers to  learn culture. 
It wasn t the first time a statement landed "The Bachelor" in hot water. Earlier this year, he said he opposed having a gay  Bachelor  because homosexuals were  perverts, in a sense.  He later apologized and blamed his choice of words on a language barrier.

This season's "The Bachelor" Juan Pablo, right, and host Chris Harrison. (ABC)
Ahead of  The Bachelor  season finale, spoilers about the winner have been coming out.
It s down to Clare Crawley and Nikki, and pretty much everyone is saying that Nikki is the one who gets the final rose.
However, noted reality television blogger Reality Steve insists that Juan Pablo does not propose to Nikki, an anomaly for  The Bachelor  shows.
He also says that Pablo was offered money to propose to Nikki on the  After the Rose Ceremony,  which will air live.
 The Bachelor  season ended filming months ago.
He adds that he doesn t know what happens at the live  After the Rose Ceremony. 
 I know they are still together and they will be together when you see them on the ATFR. Will he propose? Well, the monetary offer is on the table for him too. Should be interesting,  he said.
Renee, Chelsie, Kelly, and Sharleen will all be in attendance at the ceremony.
The blogger also says that Andi Dorfman will be announced as the next  Bachelorette  on the ATFR.
Several other media outlets, including TMZ and WSB have confirmed that part.

Everybody would be shocked if Andi Dorfman wasn t revealed as the 2014 Bachelorette, Bachelor Nation appears to be pretty unanimous that she has been the lucky woman to carry on the Bachelor tradition in her own spin-off. You have to admit though, her break-up with Juan Pablo was really convenient. If she hadn t ditched him after her Fantasy Suite date, then he may have chosen her for the Final Two, and then her chances of being the next Bachelorette would have been shot.
Andi Dorfman appeared to be smitten with Juan Pablo after her home-town date. Then, everything came to a screeching halt after she spent the night talking to Juan Pablo in the Fantasy Suite, and realized he was arrogant, cocky, and inconsiderate. It seems suspicious that Andi traveled around the world with Juan Pablo for weeks, and appeared completely clueless that he was any of those things until the Fantasy Suite date.
We all realized it by the second episode of The Bachelor, it s doubtful Andi didn t pick up on it until the Fantasy Suite date. Also, the morning after Andi s Fantasy Suite date, Juan Pablo gushed about how well it went, completely clueless that Andi was upset. Juan Pablo brought up a good point in interviews after the Fantasy Suite date aired, as much as I hate to admit this. If Andi was so upset during the Suite date, why didn t she mention it while the cameras were off and air her concerns while they were in the room privately? Why wait until the next morning to bombard him with the news on camera and stage a very public break-up?
Nobody disagrees with Andi Dorfman, Juan Pablo is all of the things she said he was when she dumped him. But, you have to admit it is pretty convenient that she was perfectly okay with Juan Pablo s arrogance, harsh honesty, and language barrier issues, until she realized she had an opportunity to be the next Bachelorette and could find somebody better.
So Bachelor fans, do you think the Bachelor producers took Andi Dorfman aside and offered her the position as the next Bachelorette if she dumped Juan Pablo before the finale? (Not that we really blame her.) You have to admit it, her sudden change of heart about Juan Pablo was really conveniently timed, and came out of nowhere. Do you think Andi Dorfman would have stuck it out with Juan Pablo, if she wasn t given the opportunity to be the 2014 Bachelorette?

 The Bachelor  Season 18 (2014) Spoilers: Was the Real Drama Edited From  Women Tell All ? Find Out Which Scenes Didn t Make the Cut
Mar 06, 2014 05:00 PM EST
Which scenes were cut from the "Women Tell All" special.
Advertisement
According to E! News , the "Women Tell All" special was pretty heavily edited and some of the juiciest drama was left out. During the special, which aired on Mar. 3, fans saw the ladies of "The Bachelor" rip into Juan Pablo but viewers got a much tamer version.
During the show, several of the ladies called out Juan Pablo for not spending enough time with everyone and really getting to know them. A couple felt like he didn't take the show that seriously. He was also called out for his comments about not wanting a gay Bachelor.
E! News was at the taping and dished on which parts was (for whatever reason) cut from the show. The most edited part of the "Women Tell All" was JP's conversation with Kelly about why a gay Bachelor wouldn't be a good idea. Kelly was really upset over the comments because she has two fathers.
"It was way more heated than what was televised, with Kelly and Juan Pablo fighting over what he said," E! wrote.
Host Chris Harrison had to jump in, telling Kelly that she would be able to talk to JP more about it after the taping. The sit-down with the Bachelor himself was said to be heavily edited and was a lot more heated than what was aired. Some of the ladies told him he was "narcissistic" and "not genuine."
Juan Pablo reportedly didn't know the ladies were bashing him before he came out because he did not get to see them talking to Chris Harrison but after the taping ended there was no animosity between the ladies and JP. According to E! he hugged and kissed each lady on the cheek after the cameras were off.
Last but not least is Sharleen. E!'s scoop on the opera singer is a little odd but reportedly she was "a bit more frazzled during filming" and Harrison had to tell her several times to calm down. She also freaked out a little bit when the AC kicked in at the studio.
The finale of "The Bachelor" airs on ABC Monday at 8 p.m.

The Bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis is biting back after several of his former contestants slammed him on the Women Tell All special that aired earlier this week.
Juan Pablo Dating Mystery Woman?
Galavis aired out all of his feelings and slammed many of the women on his People magazine blog Tuesday. He first reprimanded the contestants for not putting themselves in his shoes and considering how difficult it is to have to speak to and try to get to know so many women in such a short amount of time.
"It's very easy to speak when you only have to focus on one guy, but it's much harder when the guy has to get to know 27 women. It isn't easy to remember all of the conversations or the questions that I ask, but I always tried my best and I wish the women recognized that," he wrote.
'Bachelor' Contestants Jealous of Clare?
He then revealed that he could tell many of the women he eliminated were "nervous" when they had conversations with him and knew it would be too hard for them to "open up" in that type of environment.
"The women I had a better connection and attraction with are the ones that I felt fit more into what I was looking for," he said.
He specifically called out Victoria for jumping into a conversation during the special and said she has other things to be concerned about.
"Ay, Victoria! During my talk with Kelly, Victoria really surprised me. Why did Victoria jump in the conversation? I believe she should have worried more about being sober on the show so she could get to know me rather than say something negative about me when she was there for only four days. Does she know me? Does she know when and where I learned English?"
He went on to say that of all of the women on the Women Tell All special, Sharleen and Renee are the ones who know him best. He added that Andi's decision to leave the show after their not-so-romantic evening in St. Lucia did him a favor.
Be sure to see who receives the final rose on the 18th season finale of The Bachelor Monday, March 10 at 8/7c on ABC. Take a look at what Sharleen said about Juan Pablo in the video below.

Renee Oteri Of 'The Bachelor' Is Engaged!
0
If you 'like' us, we'll LOVE you!
Congrats to Renee and her mystery man!
Renee Oteri, recent contestant on reality TV show The Bachelor, has found her Prince Charming after all! Reports have surfaced that the single mother is engaged to be married , though the groom remains a mystery. Oteri left the show a little over a week ago, so her engagement comes as a bit of a shock.
But hey, no judgment here, girl! Oteri formerly said she hoped she and Juan Pablo had a future together, saying, "I do want to fall in love. I do want to get married. I do want to have kids, more kids. And that's my ultimate goal. Obviously, I'm hoping that this does work out for me."

Jill Mader | March 3, 2014 | Reviews , Shows | No Comments
Oh,  The Women Tell All . By far a more interesting episode of The Bachelor than the finale every season   and I think we all knew this one would be juicy.
After fifteen minutes of nonsense, we finally got to the good stuff   the women started to tear Juan Pablo apart for only talking about himself and not asking questions of his girlfriends. Hmm, fun
ny how none of this stuff came up until Andi brought all that up. It was like all the jilted women saw her leave and went  Yeah! That! I never liked him anyway!  Tell that to the tears you shed in the Reject Limo, ladies.
First in the hot seat was Sharleen. She sounded intelligent   because she is. I
believed that she didn t know she was Juan Pablo s favorite, and I believed that all the other women were well aware. Up next was Renee, who generally had good things to say about Juan Pablo. She didn t love that he waited so long to kiss her, yet was making out with Clare two seconds later. Renee said she s been dating and is really happy, so yay! She was one of a handful of likable people
this season.
We were all really waiting to hear from Andi though, right? She said what she thought of Juan Pablo, and it all sounded pretty right on. She doesn t think he s a mean-spirited guy, but he s thoughtless. He said hurtful things because he wasn t thinking about her feelings.
Andi is bound to be the next bachelorette. They ended on a note of basically saying  I think this process could work and I ll continue to search for love . I like Andi, but I think she s a little dull. I don t know if I d be interested in seeing her star in the show. What do you guys think?
By the time Juan Pablo came out, he d been pretty harshly critiqued by the women. I thought it was weird how much some of the women harped on the idea of  fair and unfair . This isn t recess, guys. Life isn t fair. He saw the moms differently, he treated them more carefully, get over it.
The blooper real was funny   or should I say, it s OK. Also, all the women I didn t like were  Team Clare  and all the ones I enjoyed were  Team Nikki . Anyway, I have a feeling about who will win, but I look forward to seeing Juan Pablo s mom tell someone next week that he can be rude!

Renee Oteri of The Bachelor Poses With Fiance, Shows Off Engagement Ring: Picture
March 6, 2014 @ 10:30 AM

Juan who? Bachelor contestant Renee Oteri found her happily ever after being booted by Juan Pablo Galavis on season 18 of ABC's hit reality series. The single mom shared an Instagram photo with her fiance (and her engagement ring!) on Monday, Mar. 3.
PHOTOS: Meet Juan Pablo's bachelorettes!
"My forever," Oteri, 32, wrote beside the picture of the smiling newly-engaged couple. In it, her handsome fiance (who's been identified by Wetpaint as an ex-military man named Bracy) drapes his arm over her shoulder, as she holds his hand and shows off  her diamond ring.
Sources confirmed to Us Weekly last week that Oteri "couldn't be happier" after getting engaged. "She is so happy and has wanted this with her fiance for a very long time!" an insider told Us. "We're all so happy to see them back together!"
PHOTOS: The Bachelor -- where are they now?
"He is always the one everyone wanted to see her with!" the source added.
The beautiful brunette, who was the fourth runner-up in the current season of The Bachelor, made her mark on the show as a single mom -- to 8-year-old son Ben -- opposite single dad Juan Pablo. "Her fiance has known Ben since he was a baby," another source told Us. "Renee is so excited to start over with her new family in Seattle."
PHOTOS: Biggest Bachelor moments -- breakups, bling, and more!
During a conference call with reporters on Feb. 15, Oteri opened up about her life with Ben. "We definitely talk about everything, and I want my son to see love," she shared.
Although she's moved on since wrapping up filming for the show back in October, Oteri revealed that unlike other contestants, she has "nothing negative to say" about Galavis. "I still feel the same about him now than I did the moment, you know, I met him."

The Season 18 Bachelor Juan Pablo has left a sour taste in a lot of people s mouths, including the bachelorettes that he sent home this season. In the Women Tell All episode Juan Pablo s ex-bachelorettes ganged up on him and slammed him for multiple things. Two women weren t present at the Women Tell All episode though, Juan Pablo s Final Two Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell. Once the season finale of The Bachelor airs next week on ABC, they will be able to share their thoughts and opinions on Juan Pablo, and that is when the real fireworks will start. SPOILER ALERT!!
It s unanimous, America (and Reality Steve) are certain Nikki Ferrell will be chosen as the winner of the Season 18 of The Bachelor. The real question is, what happened to the happy couple after the cameras stopped rolling? Were they ever a couple? Nikki and Juan Pablo were never engaged, and were already broken up before The Bachelor began airing on ABC. Since The Bachelor premiered Juan Pablo has been linked to several different women, and none of them have been Nikki. If anyone deserves a Tell All episode, it s Nikki Ferrell. And, once can only imagine the horrible things the scorned ex-Bachelorette will have to say about Juan Pablo once the finale is aired and her contract is up with ABC.
Friends of Nikki Ferrell have already confirmed that Nikki has some compromising nude photos in her possession of Juan Pablo, it is only a matter of time before she leaks them out of spite. But, Nikki is a smart girl, considering all of the negative press Juan Pablo has received, she should hold on to the pictures and publish them in an exclusive tell all book, exposing Juan Pablo for the arrogant and ignorant sham of a Bachelor he was this season. Would you pay money for a Nikki Tells All book about the real Juan Pablo?

Chris Harrison. You are making it very hard for me to continue being blindly devoted to you these days. Hot off of Juan Pablo's incendiary talk about the possibility of a gay Bachelor, Chris weighed in on the show's future stars, and what he had to say was the opposite of enlightened. Actually, he went a step FURTHER than our boy Juan Pablo in terms of awfulness. A thing I did not think was actually possible.
In a recent interview, Chris "Suave" Harrison was asked if The Bachelor would ever consider someone less hunky than their usual stars. You know, someone with a little bit more to love. Chris shot down the prospect of a chubby Bachelor like it was possum in his attic and he was a gun-toting man with a virulent fear of possums, a fear that surmounted reason or the safety concerns regarding shooting a possum in your attic.
Chris was dropping cold, hard truth bombs like they were roses and it was the first week of The Bachelor. Chris says that chubby "isn't attractive" and T.V., whether we like it or not, is all about looks. It's not that Chris is anti-chubby guys; in fact, when breaking down why it could never work for the show -- he pointed to himself! Chris. You're a total babe. Calm down. Expand your mind and your waistline. Eat this brownie. I like my hosts of reality T.V. with a little something extra to hold onto. Have I gone too far?
We can actually chalk up all of Chris's comments to his burgeoning business savvy. Essentially, when it comes to a gay Bachelor, Chris thinks that would be bad for business. Sigh. Give me back the brownie, Chris. I like my hosts socially proactive in their support for marriage equality. He says that this doesn't mean he's anti-gay-marriage, he just thinks that changing up the show is bad for business. Sounds like a weak defense to me.
Do you think Chris is being business savvy or just homophobic?

Bach Juan Pablo Recap 10:  The Women Tell All (Through Super White Teeth)
By Selena Coppock
On Monday night, all of the rejected ladies gathered on a sound stage in L.A. for one last chance to bring shame and infamy to their respective families. They talked about their Bach experience, they wore too much bronzer, and of course Kelly brought her dog/boss (lest we forget about her "job" as a "Dog Lover").
We had to wade through a lot of schmutz promoting the Bachelor franchise before the ladies and their impossibly white teeth were unleashed upon us.
First, Chris Harrison sat down with newlyweds Sean and Catherine. If you need a refresher, Sean is the uber bland, "aww shucks" former Bachelor who chose between cool Catherine and a 24 year old who showed up on night 1 drunk and in a wedding dress. TOUGH CALL! Amazingly, he picked a suitable mate (way to buck Bachelor tradition, Pasty!), proposed to Catherine, and they had a televised wedding with lots of fellow Bach lifers in attendance. Post-wedding, Catherine decided to cut bangs! Their vows said 'till death do us part, but did Sean sign on for BANGS? He should ask President Obama how to handle this one! Catherine describes their wedding night as "quick fireworks" (awkward) and Sean tells a story from their honeymoon when a sting ray latched onto his "man parts." Good luck, you crazy kids.
Then Chris Harrison sat down with Miss Piggy and Kermit (or rather, a Kermit imposter named "Constantine" who shares a name with my favorite American Idol reject and you can read all about that in my book The New Rules for Blondes ! OK, shameless plug over.) Apparently they were promoting a new Muppets movie and what better place to do that than on The Bach?
FINALLY! It was the moment we'd all been waiting for: The parade of beautiful rejects who look vaguely familiar and we'd better recognize if they were crying in the back of a limo. Who showed up?
-Lauren H. (She's the girl who was proposed to, then dumped, then came on The Bachelor. Oh girl, maybe stop doing this?)
-Kylie (I had nicknamed her Whitesnake Strawberry Shortcake because she used to be hella white trash, but she has cleaned up! Her red hair is now blonde -- great move -- and she looks awesome! Congrats, but still, see ya never.)
-Danielle (The super bland girl who made it pretty far by flying under the radar. She's very blonde now and I dig it!)
-Elise (The blonde girl with an unlimited supply of sparkly sexpot dresses.)
-Alli (The Andi look-alike continues to look like Andi!)
-Victoria (Forgettable brunette.)
-Chantel (Looking good, made some good points during the conversation.)
-Christie (The Blonde Chameleon is back! She's the girl who was unrecognizable one rose ceremony to the next and she's still morphing!)
-Lauren S. (The piano playing brunette who attempted to kiss Johnny Pabs and was rebuffed. Ouch.)
-Lucy (Who can forget the "Free Spirit"? Blech. She still hasn't discovered make up or hair product but apparently she HAS discovered Arsenio Hall's patented arm move, as she rocks that like it's 1985 up in here.)
-Cassandra (The Former NBA Dancer found time in her busy former dancing schedule to come back to The Bach!)
-Chelsie (She's strawberry blonde now and I'm digging it!)
-Kat (PERFECTION! OK, girl may be a little intense, but this look is phenomenal: bronzer, smoky eye, nude lip, amazing hair, basic black clothing. Hell yeah!)
-Kelly and her dog Molly (and neither of them appear to be wearing pants.)
-Sharleen (Those eyebrows are super angled and she's looking hot.)
-Renee (Big applause for pledge mom! She looks perfect -- deep conditioning, perhaps?)
-Andi (Even bigger applause for Ombre DA. Her seafoam dress is very Palm Springs circa 1965 and I love it.)
Chris Harrison gets the ball rolling and the ladies talk about first night anxiety. Kelly was especially nervous because her dog didn't seem to like Juan Pablo (oh give it up, would you?). Danielle and Lauren immediately share that their conversations with JP were very surface and one-sided (and this will be the theme all night). Alli says that Juan Pablo asked her where she sees herself in 5 years, then days later he asked her where she sees herself in 3 years. Yikes. Dude needs to work on his retention (and also on caring about others). When pianist Lauren says as much, Kelly jumps on her and says that in the house, she was emotional and crazy and this is just sour grapes. Oh Kelly, you're a real gem, ya know that?
The verdict among almost all of the women is that Juan Pablo mostly talks about himself, doesn't listen, didn't seem very curious about any of the women, and was there to find a girlfriend -- not a wife. Oh also, that he used his daughter Camila as an excuse to get out of kissing certain women (awkward) and that he'd constantly talk about being "fair," but it was total crap.
Renee sits down to talk to Chris Harrison about being in the Bachelor house as a single mom (and Cassandra officially becomes the redheaded stepchild of the women on the show with children.) Renee is cool and calm and we learn that she has a man in her life now -- brava!
Sharleen gets in the hot seat and covers her eyes during the montage clip of the most awkward kiss in Bachelor history . She says that they had a great connection, but she knew that he wasn't "the one."
Andi talks to Chris about her dramatic departure and the fantasy suite night that inspired it. She says that behind closed doors Juan Pablo was very negative, name drop-y, and self-obsessed. She says that she will continue to search for a "great love" and I think she means continue her campaign to be made the next Bachelorette. Time will tell, Ombre DA. In the mean time -- I can't believe I'm saying this -- but the Florida Department of Justice needs you!
Johnny Pabs arrives looking Venezuelan cool and casual in a black suite, white shirt with no tie, and proceeds to spend 20 minutes not getting it. He employs the idiotic logic that was VERY popular at my middle school, saying that sure he's rude sometimes, but at least he's honest. Cassandra contends that Juan Pablo shouldn't have met Renee's son Ben if he didn't think that she was the one, which promoted me to scream at the TV, "TRUTH! Also, I love your violet lipstick, Cassandra!" Juan Pablo contends that mothers are more important than fathers across the board (dude LOVES generalizations!), Chantel says that ALL of the women left a lot of things behind to be on the show (PREACH!), and Lucy chimes in that this isn't a game (why so serious, Free Spirit?). Kelly brings up Juan Pablo's comment about how gay people are "more pervert" and JP insists that it was taken out of context (not sure what in context that remotely OK, but whatever).
The 17 rejected women (do some rejects get further rejected by not being invited to the Women Tell All episode? Guess you'd better stand out during the season, huh?) spend an hour insisting that they took the process seriously and they were all searching for a husband, then completely contradict that by declaring their allegiance to either "Team Nikki" or "Team Clare" in the final moments. Sharleen, Kelly and her dog are on Team Nikki; everyone else (myself included) is on Team Clare.
Who do you think is going to get the proposal? Either of them? Will Juan Pablo simply walk away from it all, as the promo clips would have us believe? We'll find out Monday!

'The Bachelor' Family Blogs: Juan Pablo Gets Defensive, Chris Harrison Talks 'Women Tell All'
Wednesday, March 05, 2014
Add as BuddyTV Friend  
No one went home this week on The Bachelor but that doesn't mean there was no drama surrounding Juan Pablo and his ladies. While the Women Tell All episode wasn't as explosive as you'd hope it would be, there were still a few heated moments including some of the women ganging up on Juan Pablo, accusations of him not taking the show seriously and calling him out for his anti-gay remarks. Get all the details in our recap!
According to E! News , however, there were a couple of scenes that transpired during the actual taping of The Bachelor: Women Tell All episode that got cut out. Kelly's heated argument with Juan Pablo over his anti-gay comments was reportedly the most edited segment while some of the women called Juan Pablo "narcissistic" and "not genuine." Below you'll find Bachelor host Christ Harrison's reaction about Monday's controversial episode while Juan Pablo tries to defend himself.
Chris Harrison on the Women Tell All: "I was immediately struck by how the women felt about Juan Pablo... The women weren't full of venom and they weren't exactly mad, but I think the overall feeling was Juan Pablo just wasn't on the show looking for the same thing they were... I did find it interesting that he has absolutely no regrets at all after not only living through this but watching it back as well. He seems to understand that his honesty can come off sometimes as rude at times, but he's okay with that... One of the most interesting moments came late in the show, when Kelly made reference to Juan Pablo's remarks about homosexuality. Juan Pablo naturally got very defensive -- I didn't think he was going to really respond at all, and I would've been fine with that. I didn't feel like that was the time or place to really get into it because I didn't have the time to really have an in-depth discussion. I feel unless you really have time to give somebody to respond, it's not really fair. But Juan Pablo did open up and give some real insight and emotion as to how he feels. As disappointing as all of this has been, whether you agree with how he responded to Kelly or not, I appreciated seeing what seemed to be sincerity and true raw emotion -- which has been hard to find with him at times when he gets defensive. I appreciated seeing that side of him." 
Juan Pablo, on the other hand, tried to defend himself on his blog by focusing on how hard it is to be in his shoes as the Bachelor. He also singled out a few girls-- a move that would most likely add more fuel  to the fire. 
Juan Pablo on being The Bachelor: "Before I talk about specifics, I want to write about how it can be difficult when you're the Bachelor. Have any of the women thought about how hard it is to speak to so many people in such a short amount of time? Have any of them thought about how hard it is to speak to 24 women in eight hours? Then 13 in three hours, then 10 in three more, then five ... It's very easy to speak when you only have to focus on one guy, but it's much harder when the guy has to get to know 27 women. It isn't easy to remember all of the conversations or the questions that I ask, but I always tried my best and I wish the women recognized that." 
Juan Pablo on Kelly: "I understood why Kelly wanted an explanation about my gay comments because during my adventure we had talked openly about her father. I told Kelly that I would love to have an hourlong chat with her so that she can better understand what was misinterpreted and what my views are. I also want to understand her views and her experiences, just like when I listened to her tell me about her father. More than anything, I want to make sure Kelly knows how sorry I am that her feelings were hurt. I hate hurting people."
Juan Pablo on Victoria: "During my talk with Kelly, Victoria really surprised me. Why did Victoria jump in the conversation? I believe she should have worried more about being sober on the show so she could get to know me rather than say something negative about me when she was there for only four days. Does she know me? Does she know when and where I learned English? Does she know about all of the times my producer and I would change words because what I was saying wasn't what I was trying to express? I let her be herself and talk. I respect her opinion, but everyone is not the same."
Juan Pablo on Andi: "Andi's situation - it's okay and will always be okay. Like I said, she was at the top of my list since week 2, but at that point in St. Lucia, her leaving did me a favor. I wasn't sure if she was going to make it through that rose ceremony, and she made my decision so much easier. I signed up to meet 25 women, not to marry, kiss and play with 25 women. So I was straightforward and honest, and like she said, I don't have a filter. When you are trying to figure out what you want in a short amount of time, you have to be straightforward. To me, that's definitely the best way to handle it. I have a completely different opinion about what happened on our overnight date. I respect her decision, but in my opinion she should have told me in private, when we had no cameras, but I guess some people would rather do things in public."
 
Did your opinion on Juan Pablo change for the better or worse after the Women Tell All?

Should the next bachelor on The Bachelor be gay?
Chris Harrison, the host of the ABC reality series The Bachelor since 2002, seems to have some reservations about featuring a gay bachelor on a subsequent season.
In an interview in which he was asked about the current bachelor s controversial comments, Harrison stressed that he is a 100 percent marriage equality supporter, but that business is business what comes to ratings-driven television content:
The question is: Is it a good business decision? I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you ve been making pizzas for 12 years and you ve made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says,  Hey, you should make hamburgers.  Why? I have a great business model, and I don t know if hamburgers are going to sell  Is our job to break barriers, or is it a business? That s not for me to answer. 
As alluded to above, you may recall that this season s bachelor, Juan Pablo Galavis, got into hot water when he claimed in an interview that a gay or bisexual bachelor on the show would be  too perverted. 
He subsequently apologized to anyone he may have offended, suggesting that his comments were taken out of context. He also noted that English is his second language,  and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself. What I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept. The show is very racy as it is and I don t let my 5 year old daughter watch it. Once again, I m sorry for how my words were taken. I would never disrespect anyone. 
In a slight digression, Harrison   who also has hosted The Bachelorette since 2003   revealed that unlike the norm for reality television, this season s Bachelor installment involved minimal boozing. Juan Pablo is a teetotaler (or at least didn t drink during the entire filming) and successfully encouraged the women to avoid drinking as well, explained Harrison.
The Bachelor 2014 season finale will air on March 10 during which Juan Pablo will supposedly decide between Clare Crawley and Nikki Ferrell.
Are you a fan of Chris Harrison and The Bachelor? Apart from other considerations such as inclusiveness, do you think a gay Bachelor would be good for ratings?

 The Bachelor : The mujeres yell all
1 / 27
Back to Gallery
Chris Harrison begins by reminding the women that at one point they liked Juan Pablo. Remember that? When you wanted him to propose to you? The ladies all agree that yes, at the beginning they were attracted to him. Come on! He plays soccer! He has a face! He has that often unintelligible accent that disguises the deeply offensive things he s actually saying!
Chris Harrison then wonders if Juan Pablo is so attractive, why wasn t that enough? Abbie Carmichael has to explain to Chris Harrison likes he s a fifth grader that a pretty face isn t everything. Nurse Ratched adds that over the course of several weeks, she came to realize that their conversations weren t going anywhere, and one of the Laurens, the one who wasn t eliminated the first night after smearing massage oil all over Juan Pablo s suit, offers that the only thing Juan Pablo ever asked them was,  What do you want to know about me? 
AHAHAHAHAHAHA, of course he did.
Chris Harrison notes that Momma seemed to have a different relationship with Juan Pablo, why was that? Well, Captain Obvious, maybe it had something to do with the fact that they were both parents, a point that was relentlessly harped on in every episode. But Paula Abdul, who also has a child, notes that he never asked her any questions about herself like,  what do you like on your pizza?  or  what s your favorite color?  You know, the sort of deeper personal things you should know about someone before you marry them. Alli adds that on one date he asked her where she saw herself in five years, only to then ask her on a subsequent date where she saw herself in three years.
AHAHAHAHAHAHA, of course he did!
But that s when Abbie Carmichael, of all people, steps in to defend Juan Pablo for being a narcissistic jerkhole. In the end, she thinks that Juan Pablo s motivation to be on the show was different from theirs: they all came looking for a husband, but maybe he only wants a girlfriend. A girlfriend who is only interested in listening to stories about Juan Pablo, and whose favorite pizza toppings are to remain a mystery for the ages.
The women then move onto their other issues with Juan Pablo, notably that he kept changing the rules on him. Cesar Millan notes   accurately   that Juan Pablo was all about making out with the ladies, except when he wasn t, in which case he d whip out the daughter card. Chris Harrison tries to defend Juan Pablo by claiming that parents in relationships have different priorities than non-parents, but that s nonsense, and he knows it.
Kat pipes up that she was irritated by how Juan Pablo constantly referred to Momma and Paula Abdul as his  las especiales,  which, fair enough! Paula Abdul adds to this that she gets why she and Momma were  especial,  but what she doesn t get is why he treated the two of them differently from one another: why was he all about getting down with her, but telling Momma he wanted to wait? One of Las Especiales were being disrespected, but she s not sure which of them it was. PALABRA, GIRL. And Cesar Millan, who is getting more and more worked up by the momento is all,  HE S A LYING LIAR IS WHAT HE IS. 
Chris Harrison changes the topic again: how about that time he and Ni a de Pap  went  swimming?  The mujeres, who had no idea it even happened at the time, remark that they found Juan Pablo taking Ni a de Pap  to his hot tub during their group date FAR more disrespectful than Ni a de Pap  luring him out into the ocean. Todos de las mujeres then jump to the defense of Ni a de Pap  s honor: how DARE he slut shame her! HE S the slutty one! SHAME ON HIM.
Well then!
Chris Harrison invites Maria Callas to the couch first, explaining that all his time trapped in this hellhole, he s never seen a relationship quite like Maria Callas  with Juan Pablo. But instead of explaining that this is because there has never been such a dramatic IQ discrepancy on this show before, the two talk in broad metaphors about roller coasters and things being black and white and how this show isn t  real life.  Chris Harrison attempts to lure Maria Callas into calling Juan Pablo stupid, reminding her that she was the one who said the cerebral connection was missing and that she wished that she was  dumber.  But Maria Callas never quite arrives there because she has manners and class. In fact, Maria Callas goes out of her way to defend Juan Pablo, assuring the skeptics amongst us that Juan Pablo was  curious  and that their conversation wasn t  non-existent,  which is almost positive!
Of course, this applies to Abbie Carmichael, Esq., too.
(This is when the 9-year-old wanders into the room, sees Maria Callas sitting on a couch talking about her  physical connection  with Juan Pablo, and announces that he thought The Bachelor was  a bunch of women jumping off cliffs and kissing.  You re not wrong son, you re not wrong.)
Momma is next on Chris Harrison s probing couch, and we learn absolutely nothing of interest about Juan Pablo. She had a connection with Juan Pablo because they are both parents (YES, WE KNOW.); She doesn t regret not telling him that she loved him (GOOD, SHE SHOULDN T.); She was a little irritated to see him kiss Ni a de Pap  20 seconds after practically having to beg him to kiss her (AS SHE SHOULD BE). The only thing of interest that we learn in this interview is that Momma is in a new relationship that she is reluctant to discuss lest she jinx it. ( Actually, she s engaged!  Mazel, Momma ! Best wishes to both you and Ben!)
Next up is Abbie Carmichael, Esq. who refused to play along and pretend that she was IN LURRRVE with Juan Pablo after the Fantasy Suite, instead choosing to call him a insensitive egomaniac to his face before dumping him.
Abbie Carmichael explains that when they were first left alone in the Fantasy Suite, it was fine! They talked, they laughed a little, it was a relief to be alone and away from the cameras. But then, all Juan Pablo wanted to talk about was Juan Pablo: soccer and traveling and who he knows. Abbie Carmichael, who if she hasn t already been chosen to be the next Bachelorette is certainly not discouraging the idea, then makes a shrewd move and claims that Juan Pablo was being  negative  about the whole process and not grateful for the opportunity he was given   implying, of course, that she has nothing but respect for the process of dating 25 people at once, and, if she were given the opportunity, she would only be positive about it, always. Well played, madam.
Abbie Carmichael then explains that she thinks Juan Pablo thinks he s a great Bachelor and the crowd laughs. THIS IS HOW FAR YOU HAVE FALLEN, CHAMO: YOU VE LOST THE  WOMEN TELL ALL  AUDIENCE.
Abbie Carmichael adds that Juan Pablo also made some disturbing comments about how she was barely still in the competition, and then had the gall to mention his overnight with Ni a de Pap , who does that? That was the moment when Abbie Carmichael was done with Juan Pablo, and, really, who can blame her? And so she pretended to be asleep and willed dawn to arrive so that she could get away from this huev n.
Abbie Carmichael notes that while he was rude and inappropriate and made her feel cheap, she recognizes he didn t intend to do so   he just doesn t have a filter or any understanding of how words work. But what really chaps her hide is that when confronted with his rudeness, Juan Pablo defends himself by claiming he was just being honest, and  is okay.  NO IS OKAY,  MARICO.
Chris Harrison asks Abbie Carmichael how she s holding up, and she assures him that she still believes that true love exists and that she will continue to search for it. In fact, she d be willing to take this  journey  all over again, if Chris Harrison knows what she means.
Finally, it is Juan Pablo s turn to come out and defend himself against these raving maenads. Chris Harrison begins by asking Juan Pablo that now, having had a chance to watch himself over the course of the season, does he have any regrets?  NOPE!  Juan Pablo insists,  I ve been honest from day uno! Sometimes I am rude, yes, but I do not care! It is unimportant to me, your feelings,  comprendes? 
The first woman to confront Juan Pablo is the one who got drunk and tried to kiss him, but he wouldn t kiss her because he had completely forgotten she was even on the show, but then claimed that the actual reason he isn t kissing her was because Camila. And she s like,  So, yeah, what was up with that, dude? If you weren t into me, that s cool, but you didn t need to drag your daughter into it   especially when it didn t stop you from making out with 17 other ladies.  But instead of answering that perfectly reasonable question (although really it was more of a point), Juan Pablo insists that he isn t letting Camila watch the show. IS OKAY. Well that s good? I guess? But that was not the pregunta?
Chris Harrison points out that while Juan Pablo was reluctant to kiss Momma, he was all over Ni a de Pap , and Juan Pablo is all,   Uh, s ?  Por supuesto!  Juan Pablo then explains that Momma had told him a story about how her son was devastated by a breakup with her ex-boyfriend, and it made Juan Pablo realize that it he needed to be careful with Momma and her son and take his time.
At this, Paula Abdul challenges Juan Pablo s decision to have a hometown visit with Momma and his choice to meet Ben. If Juan Pablo knew Momma wasn t going to make it to the end   and let s be honest, he knew she wasn t going to make it to the end   why would he meet her child? Pero Juan Pablo, he no comprende   why, he introduces first dates to his hija all the time. What s the gran deal? IS OKAY!
I mean, other than leading an endless parade of women through your daughter s life, and not giving her an example of a strong stable relationship and establishing the idea that no one ever sticks around in the end, I guess you ve got a point there, Juan Pablo! I hadn t thought of it that way!
Chantal would like to take exception to the very fact that Juan Pablo set Momma and Paula Abdul aside as Las Especiales in the first place, after all, they all had lives they left behind to be on the show. Juan Pablo argues (not incorrectly) that children are different from jobs or dogs or whatever, that these women left sons behind. Juan Pablo then ruins his argument by unnecessarily adding that it was different for him when he was on The Bachelorette, because Camila had her mother to take care of her. 1. No one was calling you a hypocrite for being on The Bachelorette, but 2. Don t Momma s and Paula Abdul s sons have fathers and grandparents in their lives, so really, it s not all that different from Camila being with her mother?
CrazyEyes insists that leaving one s massage table and reflexology charts behind and leaving one s son behind IS the same thing, WHY WON T HE ACKNOWLEDGE IT, and Juan Pablo sighs that he knows, he knows, he has compassion, there were just a lot of people he had to get to know and remember, what is her name again?
But the ladies, they are RILLY RILLY MAD about this whole Las Especiales thing, and Alli demands that he quit saying that he was  honest  and  fair  when he was playing favorites. And look, while I like a good pile-on as much as the next person, don t any of these women realize that Las Especiales aren t in the final two and that the only  special  treatment that they ultimately received was that one was kept at arm s length for the majority of the proceedings and the other was sent packing on her birthday?
So Abbie Carmichael steps in to be the voice of reason, again, and points out that what he meant by  Las Especiales  is that they had to be treated with more care and sent home the moment he knew his relationship with them wasn t going anywhere. WHICH HE DID. Abbie Carmichael then turns to Juan Pablo and assures him that just because she defended him doesn t mean he s not a jerk   he s totally a jerk   but he s not a jerk because of Momma and Paula Abdul.  IS OKAY,  Juan Pablo chirps.
Abbie Carmichael then notes that one of the things that did bother her was the fact that while they all came here looking for a husband, Juan Pablo seldom used the word  wife.  Nor did he really take the time to get to know them as people, or to learn anything of substance about any of them.  IS OKAY,  Juan Pablo responds.
Juan Pablo goes on to answer that this is just Abbie Carmichael s opinion   he learned everything he needed to about them: 1. How well his tongue fit in their mouths and 2. How good they were at listening to stories about Juan Pablo. What else did he need to know? IS OKAY!
Chris Harrison drags Maria Callas into the fray, who says that while she felt he took her seriously, she is hearing that the other ladies didn t have a similar experience. Whaddya gonna do? At this, Dirty Feet wails that the 27 of them just wanted to each have personal relationships with him, to connect with him in a true and meaningful and special way, IS THAT SO MUCH TOO ASK?
And then Cesar Millan, who has been uncharacteristically quiet up through the Juan Pablo portion of the evening, announces that she has something to say:  As someone who has a gay parent, I d love if you d explain the comment  The gays are more pervert?  What was that all about, moj n?  Juan Pablo insists,  IS OKAY,  before apologizing for the comment and offering to discuss it after the show, it was taken out of context.  Alright then,  Kelly fires back,  tell me how  pervert  is out of context. Use your Espa ol. 
It s at this point Jacqueline Bisset interjects that as someone who speaks English as a second language herself, she d appreciate it if Juan Pablo would quit using his language issues as a cop-out for just being rude. Chris Harrison, realizing that these ladies are ready to tear Juan Pablo limb-from-limb, intervenes, and allows Juan Pablo to address the gay pervert issue without interruption.
Except he does not. Instead, he says he d rather not waste 4 minutes talking about it here, but rather an hour explaining everything to Cesar Millan privately. He s not un homophobe! He has gay amigos! Gay amigos who called him after that story came out! He knows gay people were born that way! And you should maybe feel very badly for Juan Pablo because people are still mad at him from that one time he said the horrible thing about an entire group of people being perverts! Maria Callas comes swooping in on his defense, claiming that it wasn t shown on their date, but this one time they talked about equality issues, and he was totally for it, you guys. Really. No, she s serious.
And with that, Chris Harrison introduces the blooper reel. Longtime readers know that the one depth to which I shall not plunge is  blooper reels,  and so this will go uncommented except to say that in one clip Juan Pablo keeps referring to himself and his  leetle package,  thereby confirming what I suspected really happened in Abbie Carmichael s Fantasy Suite.
Finally, we are given a preview of the finale which looks like it will be two solid hours of Nurse Nikki and Ni a de Pap  rolling around on their hotel beds, crying. Who will he choose   or will he choose anyone? Honestly, the best possible outcome would be that Juan Pablo pulls a Wombat and chooses no one, and these women can go back to their lives knowing they dodged one egomaniacal, small-packaged bullet.
The Bachelor airs on Mondays at 7 p.m. on ABC.
Therese is also watching  Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ,  Saturday Night Live ,  The Walking Dead ,  The Olympics  and  Arrested Development  kinda, sorta, so go easy on her if these entries are un poco late.

If you 'like' us, we'll LOVE you!
Find out exactly why ABC won't cast anoverweight 'Bachelor' -- and why they need to!
Chris Harrison, host of The Bachelor on ABC, is speaking out on why most of the bachelors are, well, all the same: straight and hot.
When asked why there has never been a gay bachelor, Harrison didn't pull a Juan Pablo Galavis and deliver a homophobic remark veiled under an "But English is my second language!" excuse. Instead, Harrison was blunt: It's all about the business!
"The question is: Is it a good business decision?" told The New York Times Magazine. "I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this: Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model, and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell."
But beefcakes do. And that's also why Harrison, though iffy on a homosexual bachelor series, is firmly against a chubby, overweight or obese bachelor.
"No. You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say," he said. But don't think Harrison thinks he's above it, either. He agrees he'd never be a Bachelor himself!
"I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive," Harrison said. "Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites."
But he probably likes eating pizza, and he doesn't seem like a complete douchebag, which would be an improvement on the prior Bachelors: Remeber Jake Pavelka, who was super mean to Vienna Girardi when the cameras were off? Or how Galavis boasted to Andi Dorfman about the other women he'd spent the night with already? Or the creepy way Sean Lowe talks about his new sex life with Catherine Guidici?
Maybe a less self-absorbed, vain dude would treat his women better. When it's a choice between respect, devotion and adoration and a few extra pounds, I'll take a little paunch any day. If a man who loves pizza and hamburgers treats you better than a guy with highlights, a fake tan and abs of steel who gorges on grilled chicken and stares at his reflection more than your eyes, go with your gut ... for the guy with a gut.

Remember  free spirit  Lucy Aragon, the  Bachelor  contestant who couldn t keep her clothes on? (But really, how could you forget?)
Since her brief stint on the show, she s managed to move on to Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel and venture out into the music world.
With only a ukulele covering her goods, Aragon posted a video Monday of her original song  Ess Okay  to YouTube for our enjoyment.
 Juan Pablo, you kicked us off of your show. We re doing so fine, we re drinking red wine all night,  she sings.
 You sent my a-- home cuz  I was always in the nude, you ain t ready for this jelly cuz  you re kind of a prude. 
Aragon debuted the song on Instagram with this caption:
"The moment has finally arrived! I give you...the Bachelor Reject Anthem. Original music and lyrics by the only and only #freespirit ME. I just want to show the world that you can make fun of somebody and still be funny rather than mean. 
We d tell her not to quit her day job, but we re still trying to figure out what, exactly, that is.
Warning: Some of Aragon's lyrics are NSFW.

The Bachelor host Chris Harrison: No chubby Bachelors
Mar 04, 2014
Tumble
Combined comments & shares on social media
Chris Harrison has seen many Bachelors come and go, and whilst he may be on the fence when it comes to having a homosexual one, he definitely does not want to see a chubby leading man!
Photo credit: Daniel Tanner/WENN.com.
Chris Harrison has seen a lot of Bachelors come and go because of his job as the host of ABC's hit series The Bachelor.
The question on everyone's mind at the moment is whether or not there could be the possibility of a homosexual Bachelor on the show in the near future.
The current leading man, Juan Pablo Galavis , has already caused an uproar on that topic after he said homosexuals are "more 'pervert' in a sense. And to me the show would be too strong... too hard to watch."
Although the Venezuelan star has since backtracked and explained that his comments were the result of a language barrier, the same pressing question is not going away any time soon, and this time, Harrison is in the firing line.
However, the 42-year-old TV host was far more diplomatic in his answer, and during his interview with The New York Times Magazine, he confessed he was hesitant about whether there should be a gay Bachelor.
Harrison told the publication, "The question is: Is it a good business decision ?"
"I just spoke at U.S.C. the other night, and I explained it like this   Look, if you've been making pizzas for 12 years and you've made millions of dollars and everybody loves your pizzas and someone comes and says, 'Hey, you should make hamburgers.' Why? I have a great business model and I don't know if hamburgers are going to sell."
And although the dating show host may be on the fence about having a gay star on The Bachelor, he definitely is against having a chubby one. When asked if the show would consider a heavier star, Harrison said, "No. You know why? Because that's not attractive, and television is a very visual medium, and I know that sounds horrible to say, but I know that at 42, in the eyes of television, I'm old and unattractive."
"Sure, I can put a suit and tie on, but I have hair on my chest and I don't have a 12-pack. I live a healthy life, but I don't do eight hours in the gym, nor do I want to. And I don't eat 50,000 egg whites."
And when asked if Harrison himself would ever like to be a star on The Bachelor , he replied, "Now that I'm divorced , it's feasible."
"But there needs to be a level of innocence and na vet  when you come in to be the Bachelor, and I have none. I have seen how the sausage has been made for 12 years now, and I helped make that sausage and so it just wouldn't work."

The ladies of The Bachelor were feisty on Monday's Women Tell All, but not amongst each other. Instead of the usual cattiness, this time around the group banded together to attack Juan Pablo.
From Andi's follow-up of last episode's ending to Kelly's emotional reaction to Juan Pablo's off-camera remarks and a bunch of stuff in between, Juan Pablo certainly took his fair share of heat.  But it was also surprising who came to his defense, especially when it came to the almost unanimous claim that all his conversations were superficial.
The Bachelor's Chris Harrison: Andi would make a fantastic Bachelorette
"I think Andi, Sharleen and Renee had a good point and defended him because they did have a relationship with him," host Chris Harrison tells TVGuide.com. "I hate to say this to the other girls, but he just didn't want to have a relationship with them. There's no nice way to say that."
Keep reading for more of Harrison's take on the episode and what he has to say about next week's big finale. Plus: Should Juan Pablo choose Nikki or Clare? Don't forget to vote in our poll.
It was great to see Sean and Catherine. Does it make it more fun when you have a success story?Chris Harrison: They were in my dressing room before the show, and we were hanging out, talking about the honeymoon and about real-life stuff. They're just a normal couple so ridiculously in love. It's validating, but more just cool to see these kids in love.
Did your sit-down with Sharleen go like you expected?Harrison: Exactly; it was confusing. I never expected her to be easy and direct and I still don't understand everything she went through and was feeling other than the fact that if you really break it down, she thought he was hot and loved being with him on a physical level, but wanted nothing to do with him beyond that.
Bachelor's Chris Harrison breaks down hometowns, previews Andi's "nightmare" fantasy suite
Renee hinted at a relationship [and she's reportedly engaged]. Did you get any more scoop?Harrison: I didn't get a chance to see her afterwards and find out how serious it was, but I love her and I'm glad she's in a relationship. If anybody was going to have good perspective after the show it's Renee.
Were you surprised that the girls really stood up for Clare and gave her props for doing what she did? Especially since Courtney [Robertson] had the opposite reaction during her Women Tell All. Harrison: The Courtney and Clare situations were just so different. Courtney did things, it appeared, out of spite to the women, whereas with Clare, right or wrong, she was doing it for her and her relationship. I found it interesting they cared more that he spent so much time with her on the date and then took her to the hot tub during the date and how disrespectful they found that. And also they felt bad for her when they saw how she was treated. I think if it had gone well maybe they'd think differently, but he really blew that and he made her a very sympathetic figure.
Once Juan Pablo took the hot seat, the girls went at him. Did you feel bad for him?Harrison: No, I didn't feel bad for him at all. He's a big boy and has made his own bed. Juan Pablo can be his own worst enemy. Whether this was a good fit or not or the best decision, I feel like he's fought it. For me, he gets really defensive and short and that's when he says, "OK" or "perfect," whereas normally you'd have a response. He either gets defensive or goes into dad mode and he talks to them like they're his daughter, and says things like, "Don't be sad," and touches their hair.
What did you think of his response when Kelly brought up his remark about gay people?Harrison: He actually made a really nice remark and I wish he had made that kind of impassioned remark immediately after it happened in the first place. Whether you agree with those views is beside the point, I was just glad he had passion, and you could tell he meant what he was saying whereas there are so many times he's just cruising along and there's no depth.
TVGuide.com tests Chris Harrison on his Bachelor knowledge
His go-to phrase lately seems to be, "I'd rather not be appreciated being honest, than be appreciated not being honest." What does that even mean?Harrison: The point was brought up by Andi when she said, "There's a difference between being an a--hole and being honest." Basically he is saying, "I'd much rather hurt someone and be considered an a--hole than not be fully honest." It's like look, "I'm going to end up hurting them anyway, so why not just be honest right away?" But it's really just making him feel better and doing what he wants and I wish the women had been better about bringing those issues up. I've had this discussion with Juan Pablo -- I've had 1,000 discussions about this -- you'll never permeate his way of thinking. He'll placate you, and you can tell he doesn't care about your point of view. He's set in his ways.
Moving on to the finale, would you have predicted this final two?Harrison: Yeah definitely. There were five including Sharleen, Andi and Renee I would've predicted. These were definite favorites.
Will we get a full Mesnick?Harrison: I don't know if we get a full Mesnick; it's not that kind of a finale.
Give us your best tease for the finale.Harrison: This thing ain't over yet! I can't wait to get to the After the Final Rose special. One thing about this season is I haven't been able to be a big prognosticator of the fans' reactions. There is such a wide variety of feelings, so I just can't wait to get the feel of the room to see if people are happy, disappointed -- I just don't know where it's going to go.
The Bachelor three-hour finale begins Monday at 8/7c on ABC.

Lucy Aragon's 'Bachelor' Song Bashes Juan Pablo ... But For Fun
By Jessica Goodman
110
Juan Pablo fans (are there any left?), get ready for a "Bachelor" first. Former contestant Lucy Aragon posted an original song on YouTube on March 3 during Monday's episode. "Ess Okay," performed naked and with a ukelele, represents everything bizarre about this particular season of "The Bachelor."
Aragon was denied a rose in Juan Pablo's quest for love, and this song -- though written for fun, she says -- bashes good ol' JP for being a total "meano." Fair-weather "Bachelor" fans will remember Aragon as the "free spirit" who refused to wear shoes on the first night and then ran around naked a lot. More power to you, girl.
She debuted the video on Instagram with the caption, "The moment has finally arrived! I give you...the Bachelor Reject Anthem. Original music and lyrics by the only and only #freespirit ME. I just want to show the world that you can make fun of somebody and still be funny rather than mean. #bachelorejects #bachelor #juanpablo #abc #bachelornation"
Watch the video above for the full song.
"The Bachelor" airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.

South by Southwest bromance may be over
Published March 11. 2014 12:01AM 
By ALEX BARINKA  and ADAM SATARIANO Bloomberg News
Austin, Texas - Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women's restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it's different.
"It's definitely changed," said Cannon, a vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz here. "I'm hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It's just, 'Sally, the engineer.'"
As startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum, female-focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what traditionally has been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.
The shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report.
Started in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year's main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named "breakout app" in 2011.
This year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Ore.-based Palo Alto Software, was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry's culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as "brogrammers."
"Part of that is the 'bro-gramming' and too-cool-for-school attitude that goes on," she said in an interview before her meeting. "What women have to push really hard about is you don't have to be successful in a man's world - it's just the world."
Parsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference's panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.
Hugh Forrest, the symposium's director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.
"If I had a dime for everybody who said that's a great rule but there just aren't enough qualified women I'd be rich, rich, rich," he said. "My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It's impossible for me to believe that you can't find a female speaker in the world who isn't extremely qualified to speak on any given topic."
Among the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women's issues this year was a March 7 talk "Starting Up in a Man's World" that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.

Editorial: Sen. Kevin Grantham is a statesman for standing up for Colorado transportation
Among the thousands of bands, bloggers, CEOs, celebrities and consumer brands heading to Austin, Texas, this week for the annual South By Southwest Music Festival will be a couple of state government employees looking to drum up interest in Colorado s music industry.
One visit won t turn Denver into the next Nashville, but Colorado Creative Industries  chief Margaret Hunt and her colleague Christy Costello do hope to  pitch the potential of the state s  already bustling music industry to musicians, record labels and recording studios, and, perhaps, attract another major national festival.
They have success stories to tell   nationally known acts including The Lumineers, One Republic and The Fray hail from Colorado   and can tout major performance destinations, including Red Rocks Amphitheatre and the Telluride Bluegrass Festival.
  Colorado Creative Industries   goal is to meet with industry leaders and explore what s happening in music and the future of the music industry to help position Colorado in the forefront,  said Hunt, whose office is a division of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.
Although her office spent $10,000 on the business-development venture, Hunt said Colorado s  official foray into the SXSW marketing fray  doesn t have specific goals attached.
Hunt hopes to make impressions and identify industry trends. She ll meet with the Future of Music Coalition   individuals involved in music production, distribution and sales, television and radio, music directors, composers and more.
 I thought this would be a good opportunity to put our toe in the water,  Hunt  said.
CCI also is co-sponsor, with the Colorado Tourism Office, of the  30-band Colorado Music Party on Thursday and Friday. The unofficial showcase, also sponsored by OpenAir , Reverb and SpokesBuzz ,   will feature such local bands as You Me & Apollo, Rose Quartz, Gungor and Wheelchair Sports Camp.
While CCI supports  a wide spectrum of creative industries   fine arts, dance,  writing, publishing and more   Hunt sees music as a key area to develop.
 You look at music festivals and events, the number of venues, the number of recording artists   and Colorado is up there with the cities known for music, like Seattle and Austin,  Hunt said.
SXSW, which runs through Sunday, is considered the premier music industry showcase and  festival in the country. The event draws more than 25,000 official participants, including bands and industry professionals.
 We re approaching this as an industry team to market and brand Colorado,  Hunt  said.
CCI, which has an annual budget of $2.7 million, provides grants to arts and cultural organizations and public art programs, funds  the Creative District Program, and supports artists and creative entrepreneurs through the Denver Music Summit,  youth arts education, and public school programs.
Major players in  Colorado s music industry see the SXSW investment as an important  gesture of support.
 It sends the message that the state is more and more committed to helping this place become even more of a mecca for music,  AEG Live Rocky Mountains CEO Chuck Morris said.  The more people that want to move here, the more studios that open up, the more interest from musicians and songwriters is a great thing for our state, our economy and music community. 
You Me & Apollo vocalist Brent Cowles said state backing of the Colorado Music Party means a lot to him and his indie-rock band.
 There s a lot of music coming out of Colorado that s getting attention,  he said,  and this  means (the state is) going to invest in it and believe in it. 
Kendall Smith,  from The Denver Post s Underground Music Showcase, and Dani Grant, who runs the Fort Collins  band incubator SpokesBuzz, approached Hunt to get the state involved in music efforts at SXSW.
 They recognized that Colorado Creative Industries and the state had a role to play in advancing the music industry,  Hunt said.
As the Colorado contingent hits Austin this week, it will be among the likes of Doritos, Converse, Spotify, iTunes and countless other brands trying to be heard in the marketing scrum   a challenge for any brand  pushing its   product  at SXSW.
 There s no question that SXSW is  loud,  said Elaine Garza , an Austin-based marketing and PR expert who has worked with brands at SXSW for 15 years.
 There s so much going on and there s always the question: Is it worth the investment to come? 
Garza said she knew of no other state being represented at SXSW, and since  Colorado isn t pitching a consumer brand, like an energy drink or jeans, the message might resonate with fans and industry pros.
 It kind of makes a bigger statement that Colorado is investing in the music scene and spending money to promote that,  she said.

The next Australian invasion: SXSW 2014
Roger Ma
A record number of Australian bands and artists will join some of the world's best at the South by Southwest music conference in Austin, Texas, from today.

SXSW ... Danny Harley of the Kite String Tangle. 
Fifty-five Australian bands, solo artists and producers will showcase their talents to representatives from global music markets over the five-day event, which runs from March 11 to 16.
 Events like SXSW provide a good springboard for artists,  said Millie Millgate of Sounds Australia, a joint initiative of the Australia Council and APRA|AMCOS that has promoted local music to export markets since 2009.

 The name of the game at SXSW is to get seen and to be heard,  Ms Millgate said, adding that Sounds Australia manages showcases for musicians at the event.
This year's record attendance by local artists owes to a surge in up-and-coming dance and electro acts, following the breakout success of Flume, Flight Facilities and Gold Fields at previous SXSWs.

Of the 55 Australian artists, 21 are dance and/or electro acts.
Australia's electro scene has boomed so much that last year's flagship, the Aussie BBQ, expands this year to include a night dedicated to the dancefloor. "Beat Pie" caters to the demand for Australian electro, dance and hip-hop acts.
For relatively new Brisbane indie electro producer Danny Harley, who plays under the moniker the Kite String Tangle, SXSW will be his first gig overseas. He says the chance owes to the breakthrough success of his electro hit Given the Chance. The track has amassed almost 900,000 Soundcloud plays since its release in August and charted at No. 19 in Triple J's Hottest 100   a solid achievement given Harley is yet to release an EP or album.
 The success of my current track is largely due to international blogs,  Harley said, adding that  the online buzz was really valuable for spreading the word about my song. But it will be interesting to see if any of that word has actually made it [to SXSW] .
More than 1700 acts will play at SXSW, but thousands more promoters, managers and labels will lurk behind the scenes, looking out for the next big thing.
 For the most part the acts with the most buzz heading in to the conference are the ones that are most likely to come away from it with success,  Ms Millgate said, pointing to the importance of social media and blogs in building a successful SXSW campaign.
It wasn't always like this.
Brisbane indie rocker John Patterson, guitarist for the Grates, described their first trip to SXSW at the start of their career in 2005 as  a bit of a gamble .
At the time, the three-piece had just signed on to their record label in Australia following a handful of homemade EPs and grassroots shows, and going overseas was a financial risk.
 SXSW is such a huge event," Patterson says. "There are so many opportunities for things to get seen and things to get missed . . . you're competing with thousands of other bands."
But their wager paid off, and through their first SXSW appearance the group landed a US record deal. They have since returned twice, in 2006 and 2009, to promote new material.
The sentiment is shared by fellow Brisbane indie four-piece the Jungle Giants, who are making their SXSW debut.
While they have gained renown at home after touring with the Big Day Out, Splendour in the Grass and the Falls Festival, they're cutting their teeth overseas.
 It's only now become financially feasible to head over to America, so it's all culminated to this point," frontman Sam Hales said.
As an unsigned band he hopes the Jungle Giants will meet international labels and garner the release of their debut album, Learn to Exist, overseas, as well as an American tour.
Even established Australian bands are jumping on the opportunities of SXSW.
ARIA chart toppers Boy and Bear will head to the conference for their second time, and as drummer Tim Hart said, it's almost like starting again with their new album Harlequin Dream.
 It's a really interesting thing over there," Hart said. "You're just another band because there are so many other artists. But this is where all the promoters, festival owners and everyone go to and they're looking for acts."
As a more experienced and mature band, Boy and Bear are ready to make the most out of the SXSW experience, Hart said, and look forward to the networking opportunities.

10 Must-Hear Bands at SXSW 2014
As everyone heads to Austin for the music portion of the 2014 SXSW festival, here are the ten bands we re most excited about seeing
Julia St. Pierre Comments
Angel Olsen
The Missouri-born singer s simple chords and powerful yet intimate vocals tell you it s ok to be lonely. Who needs more than thoughtful songs combined with grunge guitar? Her latest album Burn Your Fire For No Witness is out now on Jagjaguwar.
Jamestown Revival
Jamestown Revival is essentially Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance, two guys from a little town called Magnolia, Texas who have been singing together since they were kids. They have a fresh take on classic twang and their harmonies are as tight as any Everly Brothers recording.
No
This L.A.-based rock band draws comparisons to The National thanks to the deep baritone of Bradley Hanan Carter and lyrics like  We make some noise inside a room and call it art  on their dramatic new single   Leave the Door Wide Open . 
The Preatures
Hailing from Sydney, Australia the band s latest album Is This How You Feel? is out now on Harvest Records. Isabella Manfredi and Gideon Benson trade off vocal duties over a beat of rhythm-focused  70s pop.
Jetta
As a backup singer Jetta has been on the road with Paloma Faith and Cee Lo Green. Now, we get to hear her commanding voice as she steps forward to perform her own songs.  Feels Like Coming Home  is the powerful single on her debut EP Start A Riot, out now on Universal Republic Records.
Cloud Nothings
The first single from their next album (due in April),  I m Not Part of Me  strikes a balance between noisy pop punk and hummable hooks.
Nikki Lane
The country singer s sophomore album (out May 6), produced by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, is an eagerly anticipated way for the sweet and sour singer to croon that it s  always the right time to do the wrong thing. 
Future Islands
There s been a lot of buzz for the combo of cool synth pop and Samuel T. Herring s dramatic vocals. Along with a Coachella appearance and a number of sold out headlining dates, the band played The Late Show and will release its new album Singles on March 25.
The Autumn Defense
Since 1999, this has been a side-project for John Stirratt, the bass player in Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, as he collaborates with multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone on  60s rock and pop. Their fifth LP, cleverly called Fifth, was released this past January on Yep Roc.
Speedy Ortiz
This Massachusetts band , led by Sadie Dupuis, brings  90s-style lo-fi guitar and Liz Phair-esque vocals in to the 21st century. The quartet is preparing for the release of a full-length album this year.
 Just because we love the name: Potty Mouth
And a few Los Angeles-based acts we d like to get to: Avi Buffalo, The Blank Tapes, Eleni Mandell, Kelela, Dum Dum Girls , Holly Conlan, Banks, and Fever the Ghost.

DEAN: No apologies, it's SXSW
Forget the haters, South By Southwest is worth gawking at
By Ashley Dean
Posted:   03/10/2014 07:35:24 PM MDT
I'm sorry. It's that time of year. I'm going to write about South by Southwest.
This will be my third year attending and covering the festival, and I apologize because I've grown a sense of guilt about it. Mocking SXSW is about as common and easy as mocking Coachella or Miley Cyrus. The other thing those three have in common, though, is that they're actually fun if you can manage to not be an eye-rolling, better-than-thou contrarian.
Look, I'm not clueless and neither are most people who go to Austin in March. The festival isn't what it used to be, it's too corporate, it's over-hyped, it's not the real Austin, etc. They're valid issues, but there are valid reasons not to do a lot of fun things. If you have the press pass and/or the financial means, why not? And if you don't, why not pay attention, even peripherally?
Ashley Dean
SXSW's music festival is still a great place to find bands. Last year, I caught shows from the Whiskey Shivers and Ringo Deathstarr. In the year since, I brought them both into Second Story Garage. Oddly enough, the first time I ever saw some Colorado bands was at SXSW two years ago. Just following the coverage might give you a handful of new bands to check out.
Austin is weird, as any souvenir T-shirt will tell you, and SXSW acts as an amplifier. The weirdness isn't even coming from locals half the time, for the month of March. Maybe you have to be of a certain age or disposition to enjoy wading through a litter-strewn and crowded Sixth Street, enjoying dancing sousaphone players or dancing skeleton marionettes. That's cool. Enjoy it emanating from your computer screen instead.
Advertisement
This sounds like a pitch, and I guess in a way it is, but mostly it's an argument in favor of chilling out and enjoying something. Maybe SXSW has a confused purpose or significance, but so what? Enjoy the party.
I'll be back at it this year, and by "it" I mean following local bands, discovering new ones, subsisting on beer, eating a lot of pulled pork and not sleeping.
Here's the actual pitch: It's all going on SecondStoryGarage.com , as well as ColoradoDaily.com . Last year's highlights included Big Freedia twerking, The Yawpers' Nate Cook getting a little dark and profane on camera, and me drunkenly talking about pizza. Much like SXSW, it's a messy grab bag of stuff.
Hope you like it, and as always, happy South By.

Toronto has little presence at SXSW despite  music city  alliance
One would think 2014 South by Southwest festival would be awash in evidence of newly strengthened relationship between Toronto and Austin.
The Darcys are among the numerous Toronto acts at South by Southwest this week.  (Frank Gunn / THE CANADIAN PRESS)

Mon., March 10, 2014
AUSTIN, TEXAS Seeing as how Toronto and Austin signed a   music city  alliance back in October , you d think the 2014 South by Southwest festival would be awash in evidence of our two cities  newly strengthened relationship.
Yet as the music portion of SXSW kicks into gear on Tuesday there s not nearly the official Toronto presence one might expect on the streets of Austin.
Oh, there are Toronto acts everywhere at this year, as there always are: F---ed Up, the Darcys, Trust, Timber Timbre, Greys, Lowell, Saidah Baba Talibah among them.

What Rob Ford, and Toronto, could learn from Austin's music industry
Article Continued Below
But the sole event actually bearing the City of Toronto stamp is a late-afternoon showcase titled  Toronto Turns Up,  featuring More Or Les, Ariana Gillis, July Talk and the Arkells (who are from Hamilton), at the Canadian Independent Music Association s  Canada House  headquarters at Friends on 6th St. on Saturday.
That s it.
Despite the establishment last month of a 30-member music advisory committee intended to guide Toronto in its efforts to embrace and exploit its thriving music scene in a manner modelled on that of the  Live Music Capital of the World,  only one city staff member, film commissioner Randy McLean (subbing in until Toronto s plans to establish a music office with an actual music commissioner akin to Austin s bear fruition) is in Texas in an official capacity for this year s festival.
Several members of that committee are here, yes, but they came on their own (or their company s) dime, and some of them are wondering if Toronto might not be missing the boat on the whole alliance thing.
Even Thursday night s big  beat battle  at Avenue on Congress between Toronto s Beat Academy hip-hop crew, led by sometime Drake producer Boi1da and featuring the rising likes of Wondagurl and Rich Kidd, and Texas s Space City Beats mob happened of its own volition.
It was, the Beat Academy s Toni Morgan says, a  happy coincidence  that they d been planning a  Toronto vs. Texas  SXSW event when the Toronto/Austin alliance came into being.
As Jeff Cohen, co-owner of the Horseshoe Tavern and one of the founders of Collective Concerts, observes, Toronto sent two city councillors to SXSW last year and then followed that visit up by sending a delegation back for the Austin City Limits festival last fall that included a very enthusiastic Mayor Rob Ford.
 Five months have passed by since they signed the alliance, and there s less going on at South by Southwest than there was when there was no alliance,  Cohen said Monday.  I think we re missing an opportunity. The City of Toronto should have made a big splash at this year s South by Southwest   It looks like my city dropped the ball. Both (cities) are just losing this great opportunity. Nothing s been done. 
Cohen isn t being a totally negative Nelly. He concedes Toronto is  making headway  with its Austin alliance,  but it s at a turtle pace.  And that s much the same refrain one hears from his fellow industry compatriots down here for SXSW.
 I m happy that the City of Toronto is moving ahead with stuff like the music advisory committee and clearly it s on their radar screen as something that should be aided and abetted and supported,  says Mike Tanner, director of operations for Toronto s North by Northeast festival.
 On the other hand, in my North by Northeast capacity, I know how big the city bureaucracy can be and, in the interests of getting things right and making sure that proper policies and procedures are followed it can take a long time to get stuff done  .
 I think it s kinda down to the industry to do things in a tangible way that has an effect on the street, so that you see musicians or venues or fans or other people benefitting so it s not just a piece of paper that was signed by two elected politicians, that it actually has a meaning and an impact that people can feel.
 I think a lot of times bureaucracies like to work from the top down, but with something like this I think it might be more effective to work from the foundation up, from the actual events and the actual people and the guys on the ground making stuff happen. 
To that end, Tanner and the NXNE crew will work on their own to strengthen their long-held ties with SXSW this year to make that connection  a lot more evident and obvious  in light of the new alliance.
 We ve been in much closer contact with them, sharing some info and some best practices,  he says.  And there may be something that comes to fruition at our festival. I don t know yet. 
Likewise, Amy Terrill of the industry lobby group Music Canada and Toronto s recently minted   4479: Music Meets World   music-marketing campaign will be conducting business with movers and shakers in the Austin scene on  a more informal basis  during SXSW.
 From the industry level in Austin, there s a lot of interest,  she says,  and I think the frustration is things move a little bit slowly. Certainly, in Toronto, it s taken a little while to get the advisory committee set up. But there are necessary foundational pieces, and while we may wish the process went a little bit faster, the committee that Toronto has established is a fantastic committee and there s gonna be a lot of great people on there and it s gonna do a lot of great work.
 It s just that some things take a little bit longer.
 I think the industry-led initiative is where the real magic is gonna happen. So I think that s okay that that s where we re at right now as the city structures get established.

Let s Make Dallas Even Better
SXSW Preview Picks: Kendrick Lamar, Schoolboy Q, Ishi, Lady Gaga
If wishes were horses.
By Michelle Ofiwe Published in Arts & Entertainment March 10, 2014 3:31 pm
In case you haven t heard, this week belongs to the  South by Southwest  festival, Austin s legendary  film, music, and interactive  event that gathers thousands to converge all over every surface of the city. Celebrating the newest and innovative in film, music, comedy, and more, the festival delivers a week s worth of musical performances, film screenings, and comedy tours. Although the festival has already kicked off the film portion of the festivities, this week marks the beginning of its SXSW Music festival, which will showcase more than 2,000 independent acts in over 100 of Austin s venues. Kicking off fully on March 11th, the music festival will draw performers from all over the world to Austin
D FrontRow will be in Austin to cover South by Southwest, and to keep you up on its best performances. Here are some of the acts we re most anticipating:
Thankfully, hip-hop and rap are sporting healthy guests lists this year, as B.O.B ,  Childish Gambino , Nas , Mobb Deep , Big Sean , and more will be performing in the Austin bar scene for the week. I m mostly curious to see  Schoolboy Q  in the aftermath of his first  Billboard 200 Albums  sweep. Fellow  Top Dawg Entertainment  label mates  Kendrick Lamar , Isaiah Rashad , and  Ab-Soul  will also be performing under the hip-hop/rap bill, along with fellow R&B crooner  SZA , whose inclusion in the festival strikes another point for the TDE camp. Additionally, Chicago s growing presence on the SXSW circuit is one to be noted:  KatieGotBandz , Lil Bibby , Chance the Rapper , and  Lil Mouse  will all take the stage to feature some of the best of Chicago s rap scene.
Other favorites include the Queen of Bounce  Big Freedia , whose return to Austin will mark one of many, fellow bounce pioneer  Nicky Da B , New York s  A$AP Mob , Atlanta s trap powerhouse  Migos , and Trinidad James . Expect stellar performances from Dallas favorites as welll:  Dorrough , Sam Lao , Blue the Misfit ,  The Outfit, TX  and more will all bring a little of Triple D with them to the Austin metroplex.
Additionally, R&B s biggest and brightest will be in Austin for the week, such as nu-soul/chillwave singer-songwriter  8th Grader , as well as  Tinashe , Tweet , electro-R&B songstress  Kelela , and singer/songwriter Solange. 
Dance fans should take delight in the appearance of local dance-pop outfit  Ishi and DJ-producer  Ynfynyt Scroll , who will join the likes of drag superstar performer  Sharon Needles , The Hood Internet , and  Little Boots  on the dance music circuit. Similarly,  ASTR , Gobby , Giraffage , Keys N Krates , A Tribe Called Red , and  Machinedrum  will take the stage for the SXSW electronic showcase.
Pop music fans and general celebrity enthusiasts rejoice: Lady Gaga will be making her first SXSW appearance after all. The good news follows the city s decisions to shut down the pop star s appearance on the Doritos, 56-foot-tall vending machine-style stage, and which will instead place her at Stubb s . London singer-songwriter  Charli XCX , rising producer and solo act  The GTW ,  Capital Cities , K-Pop princess  HyunA ,  Kelis , Swedish singer-songwriter and frequent Diplo collaborator  M  , disco/New-Wave mashup band  Pompeya , and indie pop favorites  Tennis will all be making appearances in Austin venues.

PHOX will play four shows at SXSW, and has been named a band to watch by NPR and People Magazine.
South by Southwest is like "adult prom for cool kids," says David Henzie-Skogen, drummer and vocalist with the Youngblood Brass Band .
The group, founded in Madison 15 years ago, is returning to the popular annual music festival and conference in Austin, Texas, for the first time in several years. The band is playing four shows, including a showcase at Esther's Follies and a benefit for the Children's Cancer Association alongside Typhoon, Aloe Blacc, Les Claypool, The Bots, Peelander-Z and Arc Iris.
The Youngblood Brass Band will also play a show highlighting artists from Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois at Holy Mountain. The March 14 daytime show is a collaboration among Madison's Majestic Theatre, Minneapolis's First Avenue and Chicago's Metro. 
Other artists representing Wisconsin at the Majestic/First Avenue/Metro show are Madison's Anna Vogelzang , La Crosse's T.U.G.G. ,  Vic and Gab and Hugh Bob & the Hustle , both from Milwaukee.
Americana rockers WheelHouse will make the trek from Madison to Austin to play shows on March 13 and 14, at Scholz Garten and Roky Erickson's Ice Cream Social. 
"We are super excited, not only to play at what has become a mecca of music, but also to take in some of that warm Austin weather," says Wheelhouse lead singer Frank Busch.
Henzie-Skogen says he tries not to get too caught up in the hype, especially now that the Youngblood Brass Band has been around as long as it has. He said he's looking forward to eating tacos and seeing friends, and playing a lot of shows in a different scene. The group released a new album late in 2013, and SXSW is a good opportunity to play some shows in between U.S. tours, he said.
But for bands at different stages in their careers, it can be an entirely different experience.

"For a band like PHOX , who are poised to infiltrate the hearts and minds of the entire universe   and rightfully so   I think it's a very cool, very essential thing, and a great way to stir up some buzz," Henzie-Skogen said.
The indie-pop group is well on its way to achieving widespread hearts-and-minds infiltration, looking at early SXSW coverage.
The seven-piece, whose lead singer once explained that if you like sugared cereal, you'll like PHOX , must have found a lot of people who like sugared cereal. NPR and People Magazine have both featured PHOX as a band to know for this year's festival.
SXSW attendees will have four chances to see the Madison band   which recently signed a deal with Partisan Records   while they're in Austin.

Every year Bob Boilen, NPR Music's Stephen Thompson and I prepare for South by Southwest by listening to songs from roughly 1,500 artists. And when you go through that many bands you start to see trends in the names. The two most commonly occurring words are always   always   "black" and "DJ." In addition to those two, this year we noticed that "white" appears an awful lot, too, as does the name John. Michael, Paul and Jesse are also pretty popular. Go figure.
Using the power of Internology, we compiled a list of all (or nearly all) of the bands playing SXSW this year (there are a lot). Then we used that list to create a tag cloud. The names used most often are in larger type.
If you make a new band name using just the most popular words, you'd end up with something like "Wild White Ghost DJ Black Band." But the possibilities, just from the pool of words used in this year's batch of SXSW bands, are seemingly endless. Here are a few I came up with:
Baby Magic
Team Joe Orchestra
Young Wild Sound
Of course, if you find this colletion of words too limiting, you can always refer to the online Band Name Maker or the Wu-Tang Clan Name Generator (which is reportedly how actor and musician Donald Glover came up with is rap name Childish Gambino).
Tell us your new fake band name in the comments section or tweet it @allsongs. And stay tuned for a boatload of coverage on SXSW, coming this week from NPR Music, starting with the All Songs Considered SXSW preview show, coming Tuesday.

The Austin 100: A SXSW 2014 Mix
Yet after twenty-plus years of on-and-off attendance, I've discovered that there is a key to discovering the Hidden Wisdom of South By Southwest. This kind of self-help goes beyond what any herbal remedy, extra phone battery or pair of sensible shoes offers. Those practical survival tools are givens. So is some modicum of misery, born of overabundance. That's the paradox of choice . But the too-muchness of SXSW can become a route to knowing yourself better, as a music lover, a listener, and a cultural explorer.
Here are some things you can do to make your South By Southwest experience not just a gauntlet to survive, but also a source of renewal. Making these choices can benefit anyone who comes to Austin, badge on lanyard   newcomers and veterans alike   and even those following along remotely, from the comfort of a Wi-Fi enabled home. It turns out that what makes South By Southwest more than bearable is exactly what makes loving music so important. To quote my favorite actual self-help book, it's all about embracing the full catastrophe .
Six Tips To Keep From Losing Your Mind At SXSW
1. Go global.

Travel can expand you, and in Austin, you can cross half a dozen time zones most nights without even leaving downtown. The international scope of SXSW is one of its most impressive elements. Where else can you see South Korea's biggest rock band one night and a Norwegian psych-rock supergroup the next? Exploring international music in Austin is a great way to attune your ears to wider frequencies in general. Newcomers will learn whole new languages, if not literally, in spirit. For veterans, there's no better way to get out of a listening rut. Folks playing at home can create their own staycation by going through globally-minded attendees ' playlists at their own pace.
2. Stay at one venue all night.

Like so many aspects of the wired world, SXSW offers far too much choice for mere humans to manage. One coping mechanism can actually become a kind of mind-body practice. Sit still. Choose a venue, and just stay there as one artist surrenders the stage to another. Such a calm approach combats the worst problem of the festival   missing every set you want to see because you can't get from venue to venue quickly enough. More than that, it allows for space to open up inside, in the meditative moments between sets. Newbies need this break from cultural ADHD more than anyone, and veterans can rest their older backs as well as their brains. Online opportunities like this abound, for those at home, too; start with NPR Music's own showcase, streaming from Stubb's on Wednesday night.
3. Go to a panel or two.
Seriously, guys, go to a panel. The rock 'n' roll will wait for you. Adam Kissick for NPR hide caption

Seriously, guys, go to a panel. The rock 'n' roll will wait for you.
Adam Kissick for NPR
South By Southwest started as a small gathering where people really talked to each other, not just about music and barbecue, but about the practice of music-making. That part of the conference still exists, though it can get lost among all the day parties. Go find it. The panels offered daily at the Austin Convention Center feature the most exciting thinkers in music and technology today, talking informally about every aspect of music culture. Newcomers can gather practical advice and learn history at panels, while avoiding too-many-margaritas burnout. Veterans can loosen up old ways of thinking. Remote followers who are up (and probably at work) while the ears of Austin's late-to-rise hordes are still ringing softly on their pillows can find out what ideas are catching fire by checking in with the bloggers who get up before 3 p.m. each day and grab serious material.
4. Listen to what the musicians have to say, not just what they play.

Everybody knows that the musical sets at SXSW can be hit or miss. Time constraints, shared sound systems and overcrowded rooms work against artists really shining. You know where that happens? Back at the conference, where artists in one-on-one public conversations share stories and insights in a relaxed atmosphere. This year's line-up includes, among others, Blondie, Gary Numan, Sean "Diddy" Combs , Cee Lo Green , Ana Tijoux and St. Vincent (I'm doing that one. Can't wait!) I'm perennially shocked that every one of these special events isn't packed; people are too busy eating migas to partake, I guess. But the benefits are obvious. Newbies can bask in the aura of heroes. Veterans can get on the mic and ask that question they've always wanted to ask. And for those at home, SXSW archives many of these conversations, along with other panels. So you can luxuriate in superstar insights while taking a bath.
5. Enjoy the accidents.
Imagine what would happen if you just followed this guy. Adam Kissick for NPR hide caption

Here's one case where a self-help bromide really applies to the particularities of SXSW. Let go. Things will go wrong. You won't be able to make it to La Zona Rosa at midnight; the line for your fifth-choice day party will stretch around the block; you'll have forgotten your earplugs at an "acoustic" set that turns out to be louder than Metallica . When these little disasters happen, just do something different. SXSW is sprawl at a level that Rust Cohle couldn't imagine. A million amazing things take place simultaneously, from satellite festivals to unofficial bar shows to busking sessions and hotel room sets. Newbies will get a rush by simply immersing in the flow. For veterans, loosened schedules create chances to tap into longstanding information networks and find something great beyond the madding crowds. Remote observers will enjoy the benefits of these roulette spins in time, because surprise is often what reveals the next buzz band.
6. Make a new friend and let them lead.
Don't try to go it alone at SXSW. There could be a friend and guide right over your shoulder. Katie Hayes Luke for NPR hide caption

A hundred thousand people, and you're just going to hang with your old pals? It's natural, and on some level safer, to stick to companions you know. Wild cards fill the streets during SXSW. But if your head is clear, don't be afraid to strike up conversations. Newcomers, you need mentors. If you hear a wise voice on a panel, connect afterwards; often, people are happy to share expertise and even maybe a coffee. Elders, the kids know where the scene you haven't yet discovered is forming. Share a pedicab across the freeway. And Web-enabled observers, you have the biggest collection of new friends at your disposal   get on Twitter or in a chat room and benefit from others' adventure stories. Whole new worlds of listening are just a recommendation away.
One last thing:
And this leads to my final word of wisdom about SXSW. It doesn't stop in March. I could mean this in some kind of spiritual way   keep that feeling of serendipity alive in your ever-rockin' soul! -- but really, all I mean is at least half of the artists you wanted to see will be playing your town before the end of October. And if you'd rather just stay inside forever, there are those Web archives to explore. So don't despair. Never despair. The Hidden Wisdom will carry you through.

Did you know that KPCC's Austin bureau can fit into one bike bag and one backpack?
It's true. I arrived in Austin this weekend with just that   plus my bicycle   to cover South by Southwest for Take Two . 
On Sunday, I headed over to the interactive show floor  to check out the best new digital creations. What I discovered was a whole lot of gimmicks. 
Take this life size "Operation" board, for example.
And then there were the folks who lined up to play the "Price is Right."
Fun and games at SXSW
I did, however, discover some pretty awesome wearable tech in a conference room at the Hilton. Interested in an Iron Man-like motorcycle helmet? Listen in to my Take Two segment  for more. 
Completely wrecked by jet lag and daylight saving, I made my way to Joe's Bakery  with Armando Rayo Monday morning for the pride of Austin breakfast cuisine. Not everything is bigger in Texas. Case in point: instead of eating giant breakfast burritos like we do here in California, Austinites prefer small breakfast tacos.
Full of bacon, cheese, eggs, Mexican chorizo, salsa verde, jalapenos, beans and tons of other homemade goodness   this is what Texans love. When I brought up the idea of breakfast burritos to an owner at Joe's, she scoffed and said that people from California always ask for them. She didn't understand why.
I'll refrain from debating the merits of the breakfast burrito vs the breakfast taco here   because I'll be doing exactly that on Take Two Tuesday.

Chance the Rapper, Charlie XCX, Dum Dum Girls, Ty Dolla Sign
Tomorrow (March 11), thousands of bands, journalists and music fans descend onto Austin, Texas for the annual SXSW Music Conference. Like always, there will be tons of parties, lines, food, and too many decisions to make about which acts to catch. Here are Billboard's 10 best bets for the week -- acts that have a strong buzz going and could have a breakout year after the madness ends.
SXSW 2014: Full Coverage
Real Estate
Real Estate are quickly becoming the preferred purveyors of sunny jangle-pop in the indie-rock world. Their new album, "Atlas" (Domino) was recorded at Wilco's Chicago studio The Loft and finds the band continuing down the path of well-crafted songs that evoke a romantic, yet nostalgic vibe that's always warm and inviting. As simple, refined pop song writers, it's hard to beat these guys right now.
Cloud Nothings
Cleveland's Cloud Nothings have gained a steady following over the last few years with a raucous live show and a never-ending supply of post-punk songs. Their fourth album, "Here and Nowhere Else" (Mom + Pop/Carpark) is due out on April 1 and frontman Dylan Baldi has promised that the music within the eight songs is "more positive" this time around.
Chance the Rapper
This time last year, Chicago hip-hop artist Chance the Rapper was relatively unknown on the national scene, as he was prepping his throwback, breakout mixtape  Acid Rap.  12 months later, he's recorded with Justin Bieber , James Blake and Lil Wayne to name just a few.
Hurray for the Riff Raff
Most music that comes out of New Orleans tends to lean towards the Crescent City's funk roots, but Hurray for the Riff Raff hone in on the south's gothic-folk traditions that would sound at home in any club on Music Row. Centered around Alynda Lee Segarra s charming, southern voice, the band's new album "Small Town Heroes" (ATO) is an excellent take on classic country traditions.
Dum Dum Girls
The promise of the Dum Dum Girls has existed for years, but the L.A. band's new album, "Too True" (Sub Pop) is a strong leap forward. It combines the group's love of fuzzed-out distorted guitars and vintage '80s goth the Cure and Siouxsie Sioux, as lead Dum Dum Girl Dee Dee Penny blurs the line between tortured artist and confident rock-star.
RAC
RAC used to stand for "Remix Artist Collective" where it was just that -- a few DJs that did fancy mash-ups. Nowadays, it's just the solo project of original RAC member Andr  Allen Anjos, a master-mixer from Portland, Oregon. He's releasing his debut album "Stranger" (Cherrytree/Interscope) in two parts this spring, with guest spots from Tegan and Sara, Penguin Prison and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros' Alex Ebert. It's EDM-tinged pop ready to break into the Top 40.
Charli XCX
Charli XCX broke out in 2013, but not with her album  True Romance.  Instead, she saw a song she wrote, "I Love It," top the charts for Icona Pop. She's currently at work on her third album, which she describes as "very punk inspired." For dance artists these days, that could mean anything. She recently lit up the internet with Iggy Azalea in a video they did for Azalea's new single "Fancy,  in which they brilliantly reenacted the 1995 Alicia Silverstone film "Clueless." For those in search of the next Ellie Goulding, Charli's poised to rise up.
Eagulls
On Eagulls' self-titled debut (Partisan), the Leeds, UK five-piece blend a sound that evokes the Pixies' melodic brand of punk rock and the Horrors gloomy vocals. The band is just two years old, but write music that's emotionally charged with powerful guitars and a rather brash attitude. Punk purists can take solace in the fact that their clip for "Nerve Endings," which won the NME award for "Best Music Video," featured a rotting pig brain.
Ty Dolla $ign
Wiz Khalifa prot g  Ty Dolla $ign has hustled well-received singles and mixtapes out for the last several years and is currently prepping his debut album "Free TC" (Taylor Gang Records/Atlantic), due out later this year. But fans got a taste of Ty in January, when he released "Beach House EP," a 7-song official introduction that features a slew of top-notch guests including B.o.B., French Montana, DJ Mustard, Trey Songz, and of course, Wiz. Right now, he's angling to be rap's next big thing .
Timber Timbre
Timber Timbre is the musical project of Canadian musician Taylor Kirk and on his sultry new album, "Hot Dreams" (Arts & Crafts), he expands on the dark humor and sparse rock arrangements that lined his previous four albums. It sounds like Nick Cave soundtracking a romantic date night, but not in a creepy way. In the past, the band has supported Feist and Laura Marling and their music has been featured in  Breaking Bad.  It's only a matter of time before the cool kids latch on.

comments
Much like "Saturday Night Live" alum Seth Meyers, your music critic is in Austin, Texas, this week for the SXSW music festival, a five-day adventure of bands, beers and more bands. Before heading out, I surveyed a baker's dozen of Portland bands to see why the trek's worth it and named a few local acts to watch out for among the thousands invading the city.
I've been in Austin a day and a half and already been to an ear-rattling house show, eaten a fried avocado taco and attempted to devour a full pound of brisket and ribs from Austin BBQ institution Franklin. (I failed; I'll try again when they're in town in August for Feast Portland.) Check in on Oregonlive.com/music and Twitter all week for photo galleries, behind-the-scenes moments and live updates on bands from Portland and beyond.
The fest kicks off properly on Tuesday, with the locals-only Portland Party on Wednesday afternoon -- look for my galleries and write-ups to follow. I'll also be moderating an SXSW panel on Thursday about modern music discovery with Bandcamp's Andrew Jervis and others. I'll be skipping the Lady Gaga Doritos concert, though.
Are you in Austin? Let me know. If not: what do you want to see covered this week? Band discoveries? Interviews? Portraits? Taco photos? I'll do my best to make it happen.

SXSW Music: Worth The Trip For Unknown Acts?
SXSW Music has changed quite a bit over the years. Though now sharing the stage with successful film and tech festivals, it's grown rapidly over the last decade from a place for unsigned and emerging acts to a crowded city in which unknown artists compete for attention with major label and major indie artists. Some are still making the trek including a growing international presence. But often more developed acts are reaping the benefits of SXSW Music because, as Tom Windish points out, SXSW has become more of a marketing platform than one for discovery.
UK Bands Finding It Worth The Trip
The Guardian took a look at the prospects for UK acts looking for exposure at SXSW. She includes some examples of acts that have made the trip and gotten signed, including Syd Arthur and Sohn.
These acts also benefitted from govenment support in the form of the International Showcase Fund but for a full band needing visas the trip exceeds what artists like Fat White Family receive in funding. So they held a fundraiser and also a successful PledgeMusic campaign .
Fat White Family will use SXSW to kick off a brief U.S. tour. For them it seems well worth the expense as part of building their act. For 82% of the acts receiving International Showcase funding, the trip resulted in "new deals or bookings as a direct result of playing SXSW."
But What About Unsigned Acts That Are Largely Unknown?
As Tom Windish, Founder and President of The Windish Agency , notes SXSW is "becoming more of a marketing platform than a discovery platform."
He says that:
"A lot of the bands there now that are getting attention from the industry and the media already have agents and management teams and labels...There s a level of band that s still going there to be discovered, but they re very small and not very well known."
But Windish does point to the international presence as a way for bands to expand what they're doing:
"People from Australia and Europe and Asia all go. It might take one of our bands years to make it to those markets in person, but at South By they ll be able to meet those people and form relationships with promoters, publicists and labels. Usually we have bands that end up doing business that way."
Obviously that doesn't make it impossible to get discovered at SXSW but if the folks looking for new acts are starting to shift attention to other aspects of SXSW, that speaks to its changing nature. And the emphasis now seems to be on more developed acts taking things to the next level.

An app that translates text within photos, an online mental health service and a teched-out motorcycle helmet all claimed a spot among the nation s hottest new technologies on Sunday, each earning top honors at the premier startup competition at the South by Southwest convention in Austin.
Narrowed down from 48 on Saturday, 18 entrepreneurs pitched their startups to a panel of judges during the final round of the SXSW Accelerator on Sunday, vying for the grand prize in six different areas of technology. The winners each received $4,000, an invitation to next year s convention, and most importantly, a prestigious and historically lucrative title in the world of technology startups .
 It s fantastic for us, and what s most important is the exposure that comes with it,  Connor Dickie, whose Canadian company won in the competition s innovative world category, said in an interview following the event.  It shows people what we re doing and where biotech is heading. 
Dickie s company, Synbiota, offers an online, crowdsourced platform where scientists can share information and streamline the research and development stages in the production of new foods, fuels and medicines. Some of the funding the company received Sunday will go toward a  hackathon  the company plans to host in Ontario bringing together Internet wizards and biotech scientists.
In the wearable technology category, Skully Helmets of San Francisco won for its motorcycle helmet that displays information like driving directions inside the visor and features a rear-view camera that allows riders to see directly behind them without turning their head.
Another San Francisco company, ThriveOn, came out on top in the health category for an app that provides an online, personalized program meant to improve mental health. And Israeli company Samba.me landed the grand prize in social technology for a video messaging app that captures video of recipients watching the original video and adds their  reaction  footage to the original.
Irish startup Trustev won in the big data category for online identity verification software intended to help merchants combat e-commerce fraud. And lastly, in the the entertainment and content contest, Rhode Island-based Waygo came out on top for its mobile app that lets users scroll over text in, say, Chinese or Japanese characters and see in real-time the translation in English.
 The $4,000 is just icing on the cake,  Ryan Rogowski, one of the founders of Waygo, said in an interview, noting that the company will likely use some of that capital to explore new marketing tactics and distribution channels.  Meeting these other teams and introducing ourselves to new potential investors, that s the real benefit  he added.
SXSW Accelerator boasts an impressive lists of pasts participants, many of whom were first introduced to the world at South by Southwest. Siri, which was later acquired by Apple for its now-famous voice-to-text technology, Bump, which was later acquired by Google for its touch-to-share technology, and social media company Klout all passed through the SXSW Accelerator in Austin.
In fact, since the competition debuted six years ago, the 208 finalists have collectively raised more than $580 million in funding .
 Here, it s all about developing relationships and making new ones,  Rogowski said.

Geeky Women Break Up the Bromance at South by Southwest
Alex Barinka and Adam Satariano
Entrepreneur Tina Cannon never had to wait in line for the women s restroom six years ago at her first South by Southwest Interactive conference. This year it s different.
 It s definitely changed,  said Cannon, an Austin, Texas-based vice president of client relations at law firm Tuggey Calvoz LLP.  I m hoping at one point down the line you can stop talking about the first woman this, first woman that. It s just,  Sally, the engineer.  
As startups, venture capitalists and enthusiasts have descended upon Austin for the technology-heavy forum , female-focused events have grown in number and panel audiences are dotted by more women at what has traditionally been a male-dominated event. About 25 speaker sessions are about women in technology, five times more than last year.
The shift at South by Southwest underscores a movement to address the dearth of female engineers, startup founders and business leaders, which technology figures like Facebook Inc. s Sheryl Sandberg have said needs to change. Last year, 74 percent of U.S. workers in computer and mathematical occupations were men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In software development, 20 percent of the jobs were held by women. For companies backed by venture capital, the proportion of female to male executives is two to nine, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource report .
Bro-gramming Culture
Exclusive insights on technology around the world.
Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

Started in 1994 as an offshoot of an annual music-industry conference, South by Southwest has become one of the year s main technology gatherings for up-and-coming companies, especially those making smartphone and social-media applications. Twitter Inc. was a hit in 2007 with attendees who posted short status updates. Location-sharing service Foursquare Inc. took off after the 2009 conference, while Airbnb Inc., a short-term room rental service for travelers, was named  breakout app  in 2011.
This year, Sabrina Parsons, chief executive officer of Eugene, Oregon-based Palo Alto Software Inc., was one of those hosting a mentoring session at the conference. She said the technology industry s culture can deter some women from pursuing jobs, especially with the rise of jock-like coders known as  brogrammers. 
 Part of that is the  bro-gramming  and too-cool-for-school attitude that goes on,  she said in an interview before her meeting.  What women have to push really hard about is you don t have to be successful in a man s world -- it s just the world. 
Look Harder
Parsons said the surge in women-related events reflects what the technology-savvy attendees wanted this year. The conference s panels are chosen through a crowd-sourced selection process, with people entering proposals that participants then vote on and for which they provide feedback.
Hugh Forrest , the symposium s director, said he welcomes the trend after years of having a policy requiring panel organizers to give at least one woman a speaking slot.
 If I had a dime for everybody who said that s a great rule but there just aren t enough qualified women I d be rich, rich, rich,  he said.  My reaction is: Look a little bit harder. It s impossible for me to believe that you can t find a female speaker in the world who isn t extremely qualified to speak on any given topic. 
Man s World
Among the panels and other sessions that exclusively addressed women s issues this year was a March 7 talk  Starting Up in a Man s World  that featured Catherine Cook, co-founder of social media company MeetMe Inc. Lauren Flanagan, managing director of venture fund Belle Capital USA LP, spoke on a panel about women-led companies.
The lineup contrasts with other technology conferences, some of which have been permeated by a boys club atmosphere . Last year after programming event Pycon in Santa Clara, California, developer evangelist Adria Richards received threats of violence when she posted online an image of male programmers she accused of making inappropriate innuendos at the event.
Parsons said there are deeper concerns that females in technology face that need to be addressed outside of conferences and within companies.
Ellen Pao, a former partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, sued the venture-capital firm last year alleging it treated female employees unfairly by promoting and compensating them less than men. She said she faced retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment.
The Menlo Park, Californa-based firm, which provided startup financing to Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., later lost a bid to avoid a public trial.
C-Suite Women
Still, more women are taking executive roles at technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. CEO Ginni Rometty and Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, who started her job more than six months pregnant. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sandberg wrote the book  Lean In  to inspire other females.
Carley Roney, co-founder and chief content officer of XO Group Inc., said the key to getting more women in the technology industry is having more female developers -- like some of the attendees at the South by Southwest conference.
 The number one thing that can make more female entrepreneurs is female engineers,  she said in a panel on entrepreneurship at the forum.  They have the ideas, but they don t have that best friend they can sit with and jam code. 
Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

'Neighbors' Movie Shows Seth Rogen All Grown Up
Michael Buckner via Getty Images
By Karen Brooks
AUSTIN, Texas, March 9 (Reuters) - It's OK to grow up. Even  Seth Rogen says so.
As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban  parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the  raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, "Neighbors," that screened  this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.
Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes - including a  cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump - the war spirals into  depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta  Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president,  Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron.
But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find  themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have  loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film's  biggest battle turns out to be internal.
It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who  cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to  "get-off-my-lawn" adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they  are sorry to see disappear.
"When you have a kid, that's great, and obviously amazing,  but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous  life," Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters on  Sunday in an interview after the movie's first public screening.  "That's probably good in some ways, but it's also a bummer in  some ways."
Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics  appreciating the movie's nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior  features writer Andrew Barker describes as "lewder, weirder,  louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid" than previous  Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American  theaters on May 9.
The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of  the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom  into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.
Mac and Kelly's frantic debate over how to say "keep it  down" in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a  question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when  did we stop being cool?
'I KNOW THESE GUYS'
The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely  autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and  Brendan O'Brien are of similar age and going through the same  life changes as Mac and Kelly are - not to mention their own  fans.
"All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more  likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than  to be the kids partying," Rogen said with a laugh. "That to us  was really fertile and original and something we all really  related to, and once we started having those conversations,  that's when the movie, I think, took a great shape."
Byrne's likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic  partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the  "Bridesmaids" actress.
Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife  trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat  boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl  skills to get Teddy's girlfriend to betray him.
Efron, characterized by Variety's Barker as giving "one of  his most credible and intriguing performances" as the  charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly  complex character.
Where Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to  be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat  that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing  up is flat-out terrifying - and that gives him depth, Efron  said.
He credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping  him adequately deliver Teddy's multi-faceted character.
"We were able to kind of find the heart in it," Efron, 26,  said. "I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort  of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these  guys. I've felt those feelings."
It is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up.     (Editing by Mary Milliken and G Crosse)

TAGS: SXSW
This year s edition of annual music industry showcase SXSW kicks off in Austin, Texas this week and, while it s primarily about the next generation of bands and artists, there s loads of big names that ll be making the news. Here s 10 things that everyone s bound to be talking about between guzzling margaritas and chowing down on BBQ.
UPDATE: Jay Z and Kanye West also will perform together at SXSW on Wednesday March 12
Coldplay preview new material 
Recently, Chris Martin s Coldplay dropped a surprise new track,   Midnight  . Produced by Jon Hopkins, it hints at a cooler, more electronic approach to their forthcoming new album,  Ghost Stories , due for release on May 19. SXSW should be the first chance to hear more from that record; the band are playing an iTunes Festival gig out in Austin, which will be live-streamed across the world so even if you re not in Texas, you don t have to worry about missing out.
  And so does Julian Casablancas
Last week, The Strokes frontman shared a video teaser for his new solo album. It prompted a few questions for us and, come next Saturday (March 15), he should be answering at least one or two. His new backing band The Voidz will likely join him, revealing their identities, while it seems inevitable he ll play some fresh tracks in between material taken from his 2009 debut  Phrazes For The Young .
Lady Gaga is this year s Keynote speaker
Dave Grohl, Bruce Springsteen and the late Lou Reed have all taken a break from playing music to speak at SXSW and, this year, Lady Gaga will join that list. We don t know what she ll talk about yet but, as one of music s more eccentric characters, it s bound to be interesting. The night before, the singer will perform an intimate gig at the Stubb s venue.
Meanwhile, Jarvis Cocker will be on hand to help out songwriters
The Pulp frontman is one of the finest lyricists of modern British music and he ll be offering songwriting tips at a SXSW lecture on Wednesday, using his own lyrics to show his development as a musician, explaining the  meaning of artistic vision  and giving advice to budding stars. Sounds like one lecture you ll want to take notes at.
Jungle will be a must-see band
Sure, we still don t know what Jungle actually look like (think the pictures you ve seen are actually them? Think again) but they re shaping up to be one of the most talked about bands of the festival if the rabid reaction to their recent shows in the UK is anything to go by. The whole enigmatic schtick might be a bit tiresome these days but when you ve got the tunes to back it up   just check out Jungle s latest single  Busy Earnin - you can almost get away with it. We d suggest getting in the queue for their Austin shows now.
Green Day s side project will play
The Californian punks formed their garage rock side project Foxboro Hot Tubs in 2007 and released their debut album  Stop Drop And Roll  the following year. They played under the name at a secret show in Oakland, California last year and now they ve promised to do a two hour set at SXSW. Expect songs from their one and only LP plus tracks from Green Day s 2012 record,   Dos! .
50 Cent s comeback
It s been five years since the rapper released any music but he s set to make his comeback this year with new record  Animal Ambition , due June 3. What better place to preview his new tracks? 50 Cent should have plenty of material to choose from too   he s also got another LP,  Street King Immortal , done and dusted although he s yet to confirm any concrete details about that record.
Kelis  food truck
As well as playing a show at the festival, Kelis will be previewing her new album  Food  by serving up dishes from her very own food truck during the event. On the menu, she s promising jerk ribs (obviously), duck confit sliders, shredded beef and wild cherry BBQ sauce and coleslaw. Sadly, it doesn t look like milkshake s on the menu.Trick well and truly missed.
Fat White Family take their riotous live show to the US for the first time
Another band bound to be causing a stir at SXSW is Radar Award winners Fat White Family. They had to sell their services to get themselves over the Atlantic (they raised money via PledgeMusic, offering massages, meals and private gigs in return for cash) so expect them to make that hard work worthwhile. Just how America will react to their sleazy, ramshackle punk remains to be seen but we d bet our houses on them starting some sort of controversy.
Music films screened for the first time
SXSW isn t just about music   there s film and technology portions to the festival too. Bands and cinema collide for some of it though, with some hotly anticipated music flicks showing in Austin. Festival-goers will be able to catch the premiere of  Pulp , a documentary about Pulp, and A$AP Rocky s SVDDXNLY film, while the long-delayed Andr  3000-starring Jimi Hendrix biopic All Is By My Side is also screening.

Traders at SXSW resurrect Polaroid film for smartphones
10 March 2014 Last updated at 11:30 GMT
Over the past few years South by Southwest interactive (SXSW) in Austin, Texas has been heavily focused on social media and mobile.
But this year there is no shortage of hardware on display, especially in the miniature trade show which forms part of the festival.
The BBC's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor caught an early look at a novel way of printing smartphone photos onto old Polaroid film.

SXSW 2014: Your Guide to the Best Music Acts
By
Jim Fusilli
Mar 10, 2014 7:14 am  ET
With some 2,200 acts performing at the annual South by Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas, the roster is too varied and too deep to serve as an indicator of where rock and pop is headed.  But it s rich with clues.
For example, SXSW says hip-hop is still a force.   Next-generation performers on tap include 20-year-old Chance the Rapper; Future, likely to showcase material from  Honest,  his next album; genre-smasher Jeremiah Jae; Gee Watts, whose debut album  199x  arrives in early April; 21-year-old Young Thug; and YG, whose debut full-length disk  My Krazy Life  is out next week.   As for hip-hop s present:  Kendrick Lamar is headlining an iTunes-sponsored show that also features ScHoolboy Q and Isaiah Rashad.

Scottish music talent is to be showcased in Texas
A GROUP of pop and rock bands and two movies from Scotland are to appear this week at one of the world's most influential cultural festivals in the US.
Meursault, Young Fathers, Prides, Withered Hand, Honeyblood, Casual Sex and Holy Esque will be at the South by South West (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, as well as the films God Help the Girl and For Those in Peril.
A special event, Showcasing Scotland, backed by the nation's art body, Creative Scotland, and the Association of Independent Music will take place on Friday.
Loading article content
God Help the Girl and For Those In Peril will screen as part of The SXSW Film Conference & Festival.
Paul Wright, the director of For Those in Peril, said: "It's really exciting for us all to be part of this year's SXSW festival. We could not have picked a better place for the film to have its North American premiere than at a festival known for showcasing exciting new talent from around the world."
Bands are often spotted at the festival and signed by labels and agents, or improve their reputation within the US.
David Weaver, development officer at Creative Scotland, said: "The seven acts we are supporting really showcase the diversity in Scottish music right now.
"All of the bands are fantastic in different ways, both on record and live, and I'm really looking forward to seeing them perform in Austin. Each act is set for a great year ahead."
Following its recent world premiere at Sundance Film Festival and then at Berlin Film Festival, Stuart Murdoch's first feature film God Help the Girl is screening at the Paramount Theatre on Saturday.
The film's co-producer Carole Sheridan, from Singer Films, said: "SXSW is a cool festival and we are hopeful the film will be loved by the music and film fans that attend."

OU class takes road trip to famed Austin music fest
Mar 9, 2014
File graphic.
 
The students, led by media arts and studies lecturer Josh Antonuccio, will get the chance to attend exclusive conferences, interviews and mentor sessions with many of the movers and shakers of the music industry. They'll also have complete access to thousands of live shows on more than 100 stages across the city, performed by popular and rising musical talents alike.
"OU students will be on the cutting edge of what's changing and happening in the music industry right now," Antonuccio said. "It's a six-month preview of what's coming down the pipes, culturally."
The experience is all part of Antonuccio's Media 4903 SXSW class. It's the first year for the class at OU - Antonuccio taught a similar class at Hocking College in 2009, where he performed with folk singer-songwriter Emily Rodger's band. He said this will be his sixth year of attending the SXSW music festival. SXSW, also known as "South-By," includes interactive and film festivals, as well.
Antonuccio said the conferences and interviews provide unmatched opportunities for students.
"The atmosphere is electrified with culture and creativity, and there are so many great entrepreneurial ideas," he said.
Among the more exciting features for the OU class are interviews with musician Jarvis Cocker from indie rock outfit Pulp and singer-songwriter CeeLo Green, as well as a panel discussion on the future of YouTube music revenue models led by Russell Simmons, co-founder of legendary rap music label Def Jam.
"Music supervision, live music - all of the people that are running those companies, they (students) can literally just go up and talk to them," Antonuccio said.
Junior audio production student Colin Cottrell said that students had the ability to pick and choose which discussion sessions, presentations and bands they wanted to go see outside of a few required events per day.
"I think I'm most excited to see Neil Young and Sean Combs speak," he said. "As for bands, After the Burial and Animals as Leaders are both playing Friday night, and I really look forward to that."
He said the students' full-badge access at SXSW provides a "great learning and networking opportunity for people involved with music" with countless members of the music industry - a definite boon as students prepare to enter the marketplace.
Antonuccio said some of the conference sessions often last until late into the night, but that performances happen constantly throughout Austin from Tuesday through Sunday, March 11-16, while the students will be in Austin. More informal performance showcases - some free, some not - span the daylight hours, and then regular performance lineups take place in the evenings at the various venues. Antonuccio recalled walking home once at 2 a.m. after a full day of performances and interviews, hearing a familiar riff nearby, walking into a venue, and discovering that big-time alternative rock act Smashing Pumpkins was playing a free show for a crowd of around 1,000 people.
Austin has a diverse mix of venues - from Athens-esque backyard shows to concert halls to bars where the likes of R&B singer Janelle Monae and party animal Andrew W.K. show their chops in an intimate environment. Crowds could be as small as 100 or as big as 30,000.
The only downside, really, is the risk of not getting into a particular crowded venue. The festival has grown substantially in recent years, so it's not unusual to get closed out of a show by a performer or band that's been getting a lot of festival buzz.
On the other hand, according to Antonuccio, "It's one of the coolest cities on the planet, and the BBQ's amazing, and there's a live music venue every five feet."
Antonuccio said SXSW is also a great place to discover new talent. Mainstream bands perform alongside lesser-known acts. He said he's excited to support visiting Ohio bands, including Athens' own folk-rock act The Ridges.
Through the class's $800 course fee, the students' lodging, plane ticket and music festival pass are all paid for; the pass (which regularly costs about $600 or more) functioning as a kind of "golden ticket" that allows them to jump to the front of any lines for musical acts, and gives them exclusive access rights to festival sessions and interviews.
Once the students get back, Antonuccio said, they will present their experiences in two roundtable discussions with OU student and faculty members. The class is already cleared for next year's SXSW - although students should be aware that it involves a selective application process.
SXSW runs from March 7-16 (with the Interactive festival running March 7-11, Film running March 7-15, and Music running March 11-16).

The five buzzwords needed to fit in at SXSW Interactive
The five buzzwords needed to fit in at SXSW Interactive
AddThis
By Hannah Smothers
Posted on March 9, 2014 at 9:26 pm
Down the street from the University of Texas dorm room where Dell got its start, founder Michael Dell moderates SXSWInteractive's "Beginnings: A Panel About Entrepreneurism" on Friday, March 7, 2014., in Austin, Texas. (Jack Plunkett/AP Images for Dell, Inc.)
If you think you can just fit in at SXSW Interactive, you are wrong. Unless you normally only wear plain clothing with things like  Wordpress  or  Google  written across them, clear framed glasses and leather boots, you will stand out like a hipster in a Microsoft store. 
Really the only thing you can do to prepare yourself for the SXSW Interactive experience is practice your buzzwords. This way you can at least communicate with everyone else around you in the Austin Convention Center. 
This is a list of the five words you need to know before leaving your apartment to go mingle with the #TechNerds downtown.
1. Disrupt, verb: interrupt by causing a disturbance or problem
SXSWi definition: new technology that unexpectedly displaces an already established technology
Sentence:  Man, online video is one disruptive technology that really changed the whole television game, bro, man. 
If you don t know this one, go home. Really, go home. It is apparently the most important word in the TechBro language. If we re lucky, one of the dudes with spiky hair trying to find a cute little TechBabe to settle down with will invent the next form of disruptive technology soon. Personally, I hope it has something to do with pants that can produce identification cards when you lose yours downtown during SXSW.
SXSWi panel: Disruption of TV and the Future of  Online  Video
2. Wearable, adjective: able to be worn
SXSWi definition: some piece of technology that can be worn as clothing
Sentence:  This wearable is great for making calls but totally makes my wrist look fat. 
The Google Glassholes are only the beginning. From what I ve heard walking around the Convention Center, there are big things coming the world of technological things you can wear on your actual body. Even Mindy Kaling is in on it   she talked about owning a calorie counter that can be worn on your bra. 
SXSWi panel: Wearable Devices: The Future of Healthcare?
3. Platform, noun: a raised surface on which things or people can stand
SXSWi definition: some public service through which you can spread your personal brand
Sentence:  I used to love Facebook, but now Twitter is definitely my favorite platform. 
If you haven t heard of platforms by now, you re doing it wrong. How are you even ON the Internet at all? You probably don t even have a ***Brand*** (see below).
SXSWi panel: Platforms vs. Publishers: A Big New Theory
4. Brand, noun: a product made by a certain company under a certain name
SXSWi definition: a person or company s personality, essentially, presented in a marketable way
Sentence:  I don t know, I just don t think eating seven Cronuts in a row fits my Brand. 
If I ve learned anything in three days of SXSW panels, it s that you are nothing without your Brand. I m in the process of figuring mine out, so you could say my Brand is  just trying to figure out my Brand. 
SXSWi panel: Life s a Breach, Don t Burn Your Brand
5. Startup, verb: the process of setting something in motion
SXSWi definition: a small, decently innovative company made up of mostly 20-somethings who don t need real jobs
Sentence:  I was in a pretty good startup at last year s SXSW, but we kind of ended a few weeks after the festival. 
In a few years, SXSW might start requiring all attendees to be a part of some kind of startup. That might actually be a requirement now and I m just missing out. There hasn t been a single day I haven t heard someone mention their startup. The strange thing is, none of them seem to exist anymore. Hmm.

Wearable devices are giving SXSW Interactive veterans something new to talk about this year thankfully. The tech-based conference has been dominated by conversations about social media and mobile in recent years, so showgoers seem relieved that there's a new narrative developing.
And it's not just about Google Glass and Samsung watches. Numerous startups are here in Austin, Texas, pitching their wares while trying to get on the radar of potential investors and marketing partners.
Adweek chatted with execs from GoPro and 2012 South-by startup darling Highlight to get their perspective on how wearables fit into the future of their company. And interactive marketing shop Metia gives a SXSW-based lay of the land on the subject as part of our ongoing coverage this weekend.

(Photo : Instagram/zacEfron) Zac Efron teases possible "High School Musical" reunion
Although he is no longer the high school stud, Zac Efron revealed that he and his cast mates are up for a reunion.
The 2006 hit Disney movie "High School Musical" created a huge following, keeping fans wanting more of the teenage gang that strolled the halls of East High.
Efron told  E!  News the idea is not farfetched in a short interview over the weekend.
"We're all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from "High School." Every time we do...there's just this look between us."
According to Entertainment Weekly , Disney was supposedly developing a fourth "High School Musical" for TV. The movie was said to be titled "High School Musical: East Meets West," and reportedly starred a brand new cast.
The synopsis: A "West Side Story"-esque tale about East and West High.
If the movie were to happen, Efron, having had a very public relationship with former girlfriend and co-star Vanessa Hudgens, would be working side by side with his old flame.
The news of his wanting to do a reunion comes as a surprise to many, considering the actor has since worked on a few mature films.
As previously reported, Efron has been promoting his upcoming film "Neighbors," starring Seth Rogen, Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse.
  He admitted to E! Online , that being shirtless throughout the film was a common theme, adding that he worked out before filming and during breaks to keep his muscular bod in shape.
"I don't know how many times. It just seemed like whenever we felt like it-no hesitation," he said. "It was like wake up, work out and then go to set and party all day."
Take a look at Efron's character Troy singing in a clip from "High School Musical:"

While in SXSW in Austin, Texas to promote his new comedy film "Neighbors" with Seth Rogen, Zac Efron sat down with E! to discuss a possible reunion with his "High School Musical" cast mates. He said he was "100 percent" on doing the project and that he and the other actors involved in the three HSM films were "all thinking about".
And since, Rogen was there, he suggested that an R-rated version of the Disney film would be interesting to watch.
But, like seeing old high school classmates, Efron said he and his former cast mates share a special bond because of the years they worked together. He said, "I continue to see all the guys from 'High School'. Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience...It just brings you right back to those days."

"High School Musical" first premiered in 2006 on the Disney Channel as a film-made-for-TV, CBS News reported. It was the network's most successful TV-movie project of all time; and in the same year, the film's soundtrack became the highest-selling album.
On the following year, a sequel was released following the same TV-movie format. In 2008, a theatrical film, the "High School Musical 3: Senior Year" was released and grossed $50 million in North America and $40 million overseas during its third opening day.
After the "High School Musical" trilogy, Efron had a flourishing career and starred in films like "17 Again", "Charlie St. Cloud", "The Lucky One", "Parkland" and "That Awkward Moment".
In his latest film, "Neighbors", he plays a fraternity president who is the source of his next-door neighbor's problems. In an article on E! Online , he shared his experiences in filming the raunchy scenes for the comedy film. "It was neat," he said, "For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously."
He added, "For us, we really had a fraternity. We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of a method. It really was. It was just so much fun."

AUSTIN   Move over Animal House, Seth Rogen and Zac Efron are staking claim to the top of the frat-boy party movie class.
They star in Neighbors, a raunchily entertaining comedy that pits Rogen as Mac, a  young thirtysomething husband and father, against Teddy (Efron), the president of a hard-partying fraternity that moves in next door.
Even though the film with a May 9 release date is not completely finished, director Nicholas Stoller wanted to bring the film to the South By Southwest festival Saturday night. When he brought Forgetting Sarah Marshall to Austin in 2008 "it was the best screening I've ever been at," Stoller told the audience before the film played.
Writer-executive producer Brendan O'Brien got the idea for the script when his wife called the police because some college kids who were being a nuisance next door. "That is kind of the idea of where this actually came from," Rogen said on the red carpet before the film was screened. "If you actually had to live next to that and you were someone who was trying to have some responsibility in their life it would just be a disaster. That idea was just really funny to us."
At first, Mac and wife Kelly, played by Rose Byrne (The Internship) try to welcome the fraternity into the neighbor, even joining in on the festivities. But eventually the constant clamor derails their baby's sleep schedule and have to fight back.

There are plenty of homages to Animal House. An almost unrecognizable Lisa Kudrow plays the school dean, who like Dean Wormer (John Vernon) in the 1978 film, calls in the fraternity's leaders to put them on probation. And there's hazing of pledges, too, but here it gets a Google Glass-style twist. "Everybody in comedy loves that movie on some level," said co-producer James Weaver.
But these Deltas go to new lengths to save their frat house. After Mac breaks a water pipe and floods the building's basement, the Deltas get creative in fund-raising and offer up a suggestive new use for 3-D printers.
Rogen (Pineapple Express) and Efron (That Awkward Moment) graduate to new roles in the film. As Mac, Rogen "is the adult person in this relationship," Weaver said.
The former High School Musical star shows off his buff body and breaks new ground in other ways, too. "Let's just say he uses a lot of four-letter words," said Evan Goldberg, who last year formed Point Grey Pictures with Rogen and Weaver.
Efron can still create a clamor of his own; shrieks of glee were heard upon his arrival at the Paramount theater before the screening. He gushed about Austin as a festival destination.
"There is an energy, man, a vibe about the town. People here really love movies and you just feel such support," Efron said. "And the fellow artists you meet around town, casually, it's integrated with the people. Usually it's so separate,. Here I really feel like we're part of the world. It's really neat."
When asked by an audience member if he was happy where his career has taken him, Efron said, "this was awesome. It couldn't be better. When you get a call from Seth Rogen, you are in a pretty good place."
No release date was announced. Neighbors needs "a few trims and it's not mixed," Stoller told the crowd afterwards.
The almost-psychedelic party scenes will sound even better properly mixed, said Stoller who recommended viewers see the final cut. "It will be dramatically different when you pay for it," Rogen riffed.
"And it's in 3-D," Stoller joked.

Neighbours to hit cinemas soon

Reuters Texas-It's OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so. As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, "Neighbors," that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes and the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron. But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film's biggest battle turns out to be internal. It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to "get-off-my-lawn" adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear. "When you have a kid, that's great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life," Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters on Sunday in an interview after the movie's first public screening. "That's probably good in some ways, but it's also a bummer in some ways."Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie's nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as "lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid" than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theaters on May 9. The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.Mac and Kelly's frantic debate over how to say "keep it down" in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool? The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said.

Playing When Seth Met Zac: Love or Hate at First Sight?
What was Seth Rogen thinking when he first met his Neighbors co-star Zac Efron almost 10 years ago? The two field a Twitter fan question via ET's Brooke Anderson -- with amusing results -- at the annual SXSW festival in Austin, TX!

"He was very humble, and he seemed to be very aware of the fact that odds are I would be someone who hated him, which was very endearing to me," says Rogen with his trademark laugh.
In the outrageous Neighbors, Rogen and Efron face off in the story of about a young couple suffering (Rogen and Rose Byrne) from arrested development who are forced to live next to a fraternity house after the birth of their newborn baby. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Dave Franco, Jerrod Carmichael and Ike Barinholtz also star.
Directed by Nick Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek), Neighbors moves into theaters May 9.

Zac Efron admitted recently that he would be  100 percent  on board for a High School Musical reunion movie.
While promoting his film Neighbors, with Seth Rogen, the 26-year-old indicated, in an interview with E! News at SXSW, would be interesting in returning to his character of Troy Bolton,
 We re all thinking about it,  Efron said.  I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do there s just this look between us. It s so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. 
Rogen was present at the interview and joked that the film should be a  really dirty, R-rated  High School Musical  movie,  reports ABC News .
Despite the apparent interest from the That Awkward Moment star, there are no known plans for a reunion movie and it s only been six years since the last High School Musical film.
Efron can next be seen in Neighbors, which stars Rogen and Rose Byrne, as his wife, on May 9. The film follows Rogen s family as they find themselves having to endure living right next door to a fraternity house, where Efron and Dave Franco reside.

Zac Efron open to High School Musical return
10/03/2014
Actor Zac Efron is keen to return to his High School Musical roots for another round of the all-singing, all-dancing films.
The Hollywood hunk shot to fame on the Disney franchise in the late 2000s, alongside his co-stars Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale and Corbin Bleu, but the castmates went their separate ways following the big screen release of 2008's High School Musical 3: Senior Year.
Efron has since managed to carve out a career for himself in films like New Year's Eve, The Lucky One, The Paperboy and That Awkward Moment, but he admits he'd love to reunite onscreen with his old pals for another High School Musical outing - and he's not the only one.
The 26-year-old tells Eonline.com, "We're all thinking about it. I continue to see all the guys from High School... It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. It brings you right back to those days."
High School Musical's first two instalments were made as TV movies, but the third film was given a theatrical release due to high demand, grossing US$252.9 million worldwide on an US$11 million budget.

Zac Efron Confirms He Is Eager For 'High School...
Zac Efron Confirms He Is Eager For 'High School Musical' Reunion Movie
Zac Efron South by Southwest
The 26 year-old actor admits to enjoy seeing his former 'High School Musical' co-stars because "we never forget a single moment of that experience."
It has been a long time since Zac Efron entertained Disney audiences in the 'High School Musical' trilogy, 6 years ago in fact.
But that doesn't mean the 26 year-old has forgotten what made him into a star.
Efron, who has since taken on much more serious roles such as 'Parkland' and 'The Lucky One', has confirmed that he is definitely keen on a reunion with his former 'High School Musical' cast mates.
While promoting his new comedy 'Neighbors', along with Seth Rogen, Efron stated that he is "100 percent" interest in shooting a reunion movie, if the offer was there.
The revelation came this Sunday (March 9th), at the South By Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, and he told E!News that "we're all thinking about it," referring to his fellow 'HSM' stars.
"I continue to see all the guys from High School," Efron said. "Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience."
Zac also explained that when he gets together with the former cast members, "It brings you right back to those days," which is when many of them were first exposed to a large amount of success.
The successful musical movie franchise began in 2006 with a straight-to-television movie for the Disney Channel, this was then followed by a sequel in 2007 and the final instalment was made into a feature film in 2008.
Rogen, who directed and starred in 'Neighbors, also commented on a possible 'HSM' reunion.
"You guys can make a really dirty, R-rated version of High School Musical," he joked. "It would be so funny, wouldn't it?"
The upcoming R-rated comedy , which follows Rogen, his wife and baby clash an unruly gang of frat students who move in next door and take over the neighbourhood with their ridiculous antics, is set to hit theatres May 9th.

The frat-house comedy is a movie sub-genre that has spawned some of the most entertaining, immature and hilarious films of all-time. National Lampoon s Animal House is a bona fide classic, while the likes of Revenge of the Nerds, Van Wilder and Old School all have their fair share of laughs.
And Neighbors (or Bad Neighbours as it s called in the UK) may be the best of the bunch. It helps that the film has a pretty great comedy pedigree, being directed by Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek helmer Nick Stoller and starring the likes of Seth Rogen, Zac Efron and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. And true to form, the jokes come thick and fast, with very few failing to hit the mark.
Rogen plays Mac Radner, who moves to suburbia with his wife and new-born baby in an effort to embrace the quiet life. The most exciting Mac s day now gets is having sex in a room other than the bedroom, but he s happy with his lot in life.  And wouldn t you be if your wife looked like Rose Byrne?
All that changes when a fraternity moves in next door however. Initially shocked, Mac and his missus Kelly decide that their best tactic is to welcome the youngsters with open arms. And so they launch a charm offensive, stopping by to say hi, and even offering them a joint in an effort to be cool and neighborly.
And initially things go well, with frat head Teddy (Zac Efron) bonding with Mac and flirting with Kelly. But the honeymoon period is brief, with Delta Psi s parties becoming increasingly loud and raucous, so much so that the couple are forced to call the police. And that s when the real fun begins.
As war is declared, the frat boys endeavoring to ruin life for the couple and Mac and Kelly giving as good as they get.
It starts with simple pranks, the lads making a mess on the couple s lawn, the retaliation involving Kelly stirring things up between the brothers at one of their parties. But the battle quickly escalates, with proceedings turning both nasty and hilarious, most notably during Delta s insane end of year blow-out.
Efron excels as the douchebag daddy of the frat, all cocksure arrogance in the film s early scenes before becoming increasingly insecure as proceedings progress. Indeed you re never quit sure exactly where he's coming from throughout the film, which is a testament to Efron s talents and makes Teddy the film s most interesting character.
Seth Rogen is as good as ever as Mac, his inherent likeability ensuring you root for the character in spite of his stupidity. And Rose Byrne is something of a revelation as Kelly, with many of the film s best moments revolving around the nasty plans that she concocts.
Dave Franco, Chritopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael also bring the laughs as frat-boy fools, while Submarine star Craig Roberts delivers a wicked turn as a pledge who is simply referred to as Ass-Juice.
All of which makes for a very silly film that that has little in the way of depth or substance, but enough jokes to ensure that such superficiality doesn't really matter.

Zac Efron keen on "High School Musical" reunion

Zac Efron wouldn't mind reliving his East High School glory days.
The "That Awkward Moment" actor recently said he that would be "100 percent" interested in joining the cast of a potential "High School Musical" reunion film.
While promoting his new raunchy comedy "Neighbors" on Sunday at this year's South by Southwest Festival in Austin, Texas, the 26-year-old actor told E! News that he and his "HSM" co-stars have mulled over the idea.
"We're all thinking about it," Efron said.
"I continue to see all the guys from 'High School,'" he added. "Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience."
A reunion film could mean big bucks for the franchise's studio, Disney.
The first "HSM" film premiered on the Disney Channel in 2006, almost instantly becoming the network's most successful made-for-TV movie of all time. The film's soundtrack became the highest-selling album of 2006.
A made-for-TV sequel was released in 2007, followed by a 2008 theatrical film release, "High School Musical 3: Senior Year," which took in a worldwide gross of $252.9 million against an $11-million budget.
Efron , who was propelled to fame by the franchise, portrayed basketball star Troy Bolton, who finds himself in a Romeo-and-Juliet type romance with transfer student Gabriella Montez, played by Vanessa Hudgens .

Zac Efron Reveals He Would '100 Percent' Do 'High School Musical' Reunion
March 10, 2014

"High School Musical 3? was released back in 2008, but Zac Efron , now 26, isn't totally ready to get rid of his Troy Bolton alter-ego just yet.
Efron has been in a number of films since the Disney musical premiered in theaters but, in a new interview with an E! News reporter at this year's SXSW event, he says he would "100 percent" do a reunion "High School Musical" movie.
"We're all thinking about it," Efron spills to the reporter.
He continued: "I continue to see all the guys from "High School." Every time we do, there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. It brings you right back to those days."
The actor is at SXSW in Austin, Texas, promoting "Neighbors," his new movie with Seth Rogen, 31. Rogen was with Efron during the E! News interview and even stepped in to suggest making a "really dirty, R-rated 'High School Musical' movie."

There are no reports of a reunion movie being in the works at the moment, but Efron's "Neighbors" is set to enter theaters May 9 and there is already a lot of buzz surrounding it.
The R-rated comedy follows the story of two competing households, neighbors, of course. One holds Rogen, his wife (played by Rose Byrne, 34) and their baby. The other houses a large fraternity with a bunch of partiers, including Efron and Dave Franco, 28. The neighbors go back-and-forth with their antics trying to out-prank the other with hilarious outcomes for both parties.

Zac Efron wants to make another High School Musical movie. 
The 26-year-old heartthrob shot to fame with the first film in the Disney franchise in 2006 before following it up with two more and Zac would '100 per cent' jump at the chance to work on a fourth. 
He told E! News : 'We're all thinking about it.
Back to his roots? Zac Efron has admitted he would love to work on a fourth High School Musical movie and he and the cast are thinking about it
'I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do there's just this look between us. 
'It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience.
'[As soon as I see them] it brings you right back to those days.'
While Zac has remained close to many of his co-stars including Corbin Bleu and Ashley Tisdale, it is unclear if he and Vanessa Hudgens, who played his on-screen love interest are still on good terms. 
The former couple   who portrayed Troy Bolton and his girlfriend Gabriella Montez in the franchise   dated from 2007 to 2010.
He's back! Zac revealed he would jump at the chance to reprise the role of Troy Bolton in a new HSM movie
However, Zac has other things on his mind right now as he prepares for the release of his new movie Neighbors. 
The flick stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as a young couple with a baby whose lives are made difficult thanks to the hard partying fraternity next door. 
Zac plays a member of the frat and loved working on the comedy.
Thinking about it: Zac says he and the cast inclduing Lucas Grabeel, Monique Coleman, Corbin Bleu, Ashley Tisdale,  and Vanessa Hudgens are still close and considering a new HSM movie
He said: 'It was neat. For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.
'For us, we really had a fraternity.
'We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.'

Often, Disney Channel stars go out of their way to show they are no longer child entertainers (Miley Cyrus anyone?). The stars of High School Musical, however, are an exception and are apparently not too big, old or famous to do a reunion.
While in Austin for SXSW, Zac Efron revealed that he would do another High School Musical movie "100 percent."
"We're all thinking about it," Efron said in an interview with E! News .

The High School Musical franchise took tweens and teens by storm when the first movie premiered in 2006. The Disney Channel movie also featured Vanessa Hudgens , now 25 years old, Ashley Tisdale, now 28 years old, and Corbin Bleu, now 25 years old.
"I continue to see all the guys from High School," Efron, now 26 years old, said. "Every time we do ... there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience."
The television movie's two sequels, High School Musical 2 and High School Musical 3: Senior Year premiered in 2007 and 2008, respectively.
"It brings you right back to those days," Efron said about running into his former cast mates.
Efron is now promoting a raunchier film called Neighbors, which co-stars Seth Rogen. The film was received positively after its SXSW premiere.The film features infinitely more dirty scenes than all of the High School Musical movies combined.
"It was neat [to film the raunchy scenes]," Efron admitted.  "For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously."
The movie features Efron as a frat boy who tortures Rogen and actress Rose Byrne's characters who just had a baby.
"For us, we really had a fraternity," Efron said."We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun."
Neighbors hits theaters May 9, 2014.

Several months ago now, our Weekly Trailer Roundup was topped by a pair of R-comedies headlined by Zac Efron: That Awkward Moment and Neighbors. To me, they both had potential. The trailers did their job. I was excited for the movies. Then I actually saw That Awkward Moment, and  excited  is about the last thing I felt. Fairly or not, my excitement for Neighbors was seriously tempered (Efron is the only connective tissue betwee the two pics, but I didn t think he was great in Moment).
That ll teach me to whimsically equate unrelated productions.
To a sold out crowd, Neighbors made its premier Saturday night at SXSW, and it wouldn t be much of an exaggeration to say it had us literally rolling in the aisles. It s no exaggeration to say this is one of the funniest and freshest R-comedies since The Hangover. Now if they can just avoid the impulse to serialize it to death.
The story follows two threads: Seth Rogen and Rose Byre as a couple with a new baby trying to come to terms with the realities of responsible adulthood, and a frat cohort led by Zac Efron and Dave Franco trying to make fraternity history by doing something epic, something on the level of say, inventing beer pong and just maybe trying to cope with the impending conclusion of college as well. After burning a prior house down, the frat moves in next door to Teddy and Kelly (Rogen and Byrne), and through a series of events that I won t go into here (but are pretty damn funny to watch), the two households begin an epic feud.
If that all sounds a little crazy, it s because it is. But the movie absolutely nails the tone it s trying for, consistently asking the audience not to suspend their disbelief entirely, but only to push the bounds of believable out a little ways. It s what allows the movie to isolate Teddy and Kelly from the rest of the neighborhood by saying the frat bought out the rest of the block, but Teddy and Kelly can t move because, being next to a frat, their home value has now plummeted. This is where the real fun of the movie is found. It gives itself license to do just about anything, but restrains itself just enough that the audience isn t pulled in too many directions. It s a lot like The Hangover, actually, by way of Home Alone. You want to believe all the craziness these characters do, and so it flies.
A big part of that is the way the characters themselves are drawn. As the old adage goes, keep it simple, stupid, and although I never thought I d celebrate character arcs so skinny they re practically anorexic, it s exactly that this movie calls for. What sets it apart is that is that it doesn t forsake its characters. Rogen is the formerly partying everyman he plays so well, taken to a new high here when he s forced to couple that with actual responsibility for a wife and child. Byrne s Kelly is a woman struggling to stay sane while staying home all day. Efron is the king who knows his reign must end. And Franco is the sidekick who points him the way. There s not very much, but the way little bits of personality are sprinkled throughout the film contributes the grounding that the picture has. But those are also easy character arcs to complete. The most heavy-handed it gets is Efron confronting his own college mortality, and even that gets broken up by an amazing series of bros before hoes jokes.
Because really, that s what we want from this movie   jokes   and thank goodness the script and the actors are good enough to give us an abundance of hilarity. Rogen, of course, is a known comic quantity, but Efron proves very capable and Franco fits his sidekick role well, although it does seem like some of the awkwardness of his character is less acting and more pure awkwardness. Byrne gets a chance to leave behind the stuck up nature of her character in Bridesmaids, and absolutely owns it as the desperate-for-a-party Kelly. And finally, a discussion of the cast cannot conclude without mentioning the sublime comic supporting turn of Ike Bairnholtz as Teddy s friend from work, as well as an all-too-brief performance from Lisa Kudrow.
The Verdict: 4 out of 5
This review has ended up somewhat shorter than normal, but that s because there s a very limited amount to say. This movie knows what it is: an R-comedy the vein of Knocked Up, Superbad, The Hangover, etc., but it s smart enough to remain engaging and well executed to a high degree. My patience for this kind of film can be limited, but Neighbors knows what it s doing. It doesn t outstay its welcome, it s hilarious throughout, and it has all the character development it needs without an ounce more. Your enjoyment of this film is going to be entirely contingent on your enjoyment of others of its kind, as it is directly out of the Apatow circle of influence, but rest assured   this is among the better films this subgenre has to offer.

Zac Efron 'thinking about' High School Musical reunion film
Zac Efron is ''thinking about'' a 'High School Musical' reunion movie.
The 26-year-old actor was catapulted to the spotlight in 2006's hit film where he played popular student and captain of the varsity basketball team, Troy Bolton, alongside Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale.
The hunk claims he still meets up with his former co-stars, who've never forgotten the experience they shared, and insists their reunions take them back to the days when they worked together.
He told E! News: ''We're all thinking about it [reunion movie].
''I continue to see all the guys from 'High School'.

In an interview with E! News , High School Musical star Zac Efron revealed that he would be "100 percent' up for doing a reunion of the hit Disney Channel film. Watch the interview here !
"We're all thinking about it," the actor told E! while promoting his new comedy, Neighbors, at SXSW in Austin. "I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience."
He added that as soon as he does see any of his HSM co-stars, "It brings you right back to those days."
The High School Musical franchise began as a television movie on the Disney Channel in 2006. A sequel premiered the next year followed by a feature film in 2008.
The film's soundtrack was the best-selling album in the U.S. in 2006. In 2012, it was reported that more than 225 million viewers have reportedly watched the three HSMs.
Since HSM ended, Efron has gone on to star in a variety of big screen films, including 17 Again, The Paperboy with Nicole Kidman, Parkland and most recently That Awkward Moment opposite Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller.
It was revealed in the fall that Efron had done a stint in rehab in early 2013. Not only is he looking better than ever, but if buzz is correct, Neighbors is destined to be a box office hit when it's released on May 9. "It was neat," Efron said about shooting the movie's many NSFW bits. "For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously."
In the flick, Efron plays the hard-partying president of a fraternity wreaking havoc on their next door neighbors, a young couple (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) with a baby. "For us, we really had a fraternity," Efron said. "We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun."

Rose Byrne In 'Neighbors' Is Your SXSW Breakout
By Christopher Rosen
Universal
So far, this year's most buzzed about South by Southwest performance hasn't come from an unknown actor on the cusp of a breakout , but a famous actress with a string of box-office hits on her resume: Rose Byrne. The 34-year-old star straight-up steals Nicholas Stoller's "Neighbors" right out from under Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse with a go-for-broke energy that should have her name mentioned on a surfeit of summer best-of lists come Labor Day. (Best Performance, Best Slow-Motion Strut, Best Recitation Of "Take It Sleazy." )
"I worked with her on 'Get Him to the Greek.' I think she's literally Meryl Streep," director Nicholas Stoller told HuffPost Entertainment at SXSW on Sunday, one day after Universal debuted a work-in-progress cut of the comedy. "She can do every kind of character and none of them are like who she is exactly. From the very beginning, when we were talking about this couple, she was at the top of our list."
Byrne and Rogen star as that aforementioned couple, Kelly and Mac, new parents who have their lives thrown into further disarray when a fraternity house run by Efron and Franco moves next door. "Neighbors" tracks the escalating war between the two residences, as well as Byrne and Rogen's slow realization that they are no longer young and cool. (A hilarious conversation between Rogen and Efron's characters about whether Batman is most associated with Michael Keaton or Christian Bale puts the generational divide in pop-culture context.) Within that setup, Byrne's character is allowed to express just as much immaturity and confusion as her onscreen husband, yanking "Neighbors" out of the familiar pool of male-driven, arrested development comedies which have risen to prominence in the last decade.
"When I had my first baby, I had a nervous breakdown. As did my wife," said Stoller, who also directed "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and "The Five-Year Engagement." "It wasn't like she was fine with it. When I asked all my friends, they said the same thing: everybody has a nervous breakdown. Usually in movies, just the guy does. It's unrealistic."
Eschewing those expected norms, however, may have an unintended consequence: exposing how audiences are now conditioned to expect the worst when it comes to the portrayal modern-day wives and girlfriends in studio comedies.
"There was a funny thing where we had a test screening, and there was a focus group afterward. Rose's character always tests really high. We were talking to the focus group and asked, 'Why do you like Rose?' And this guy was like, 'Because she was, like, not just yelling at her husband,'" Stoller said before breaking into laughter. "That's the lowest fucking bar. Rose does a great job, but we could do anything. Just be nice to Seth and we would get accolades."
As Stoller recalled, crafting Byrne's character was a collaborative effort, one that started with Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien's script and extended to the actress herself.
"Rose helped us, too," Stoller said of making sure that Kelly was never, in his words, a "shrew." "There was still even a little bit of that in the draft as we got closer to shooting. It was actually when they go over to the frat on the first night. We only had Seth sneaking out and lying about it to Rose. She was like, 'I think I would go.' We were like, 'Okay, you're right. Of course!' It takes you a while to figure very obvious things out."
"Neighbors," which Stoller said was mostly locked in beyond some sound mixing and finalized end-credits, is out in theaters on May 9.

Rogen's comedy draws laughs at SXSW

Seth Rogen's new film Neighbours had the audience in stitches as it premiered at SXSW.

Seth Rogen's Neighbours was screened at SXSW
Seth Rogen's new film Neighbours had the audience in stitches as it premiered at SXSW.
A nearly complete cut of the comedy - about a couple (Seth and Rose Byrne) whose peaceful life is ruined when a fraternity moves in next door - was screened at South By Southwest to a sold-out crowd.
Variety reported that Seth spoke to the audience and explained that his inspiration for a series of car airbag pranks came from YouTube videos.
"There is a zero per cent survival rate and we thought it was so funny we put it in the movie 17 times, but don't do it to your friends," he said.
The film's stars Zac Efron, who plays the fraternity's president, Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse also attended the event in Texas.
Discussing the shoot, Dave told the audience he had fun filming one of the saucier scenes, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
He said: "My favourite interaction with the director Nick Stoller was during my awkward sex scene. I did the first couple takes and Nick ran upstairs and he leans in and he's like, 'Hey Dave, just, uh, like, more jack rabbit'."
After the movie, Zac told the audience: "We will take it back to college tonight," and people then headed to the after party at a bar that had been decked out to look like a frat house.
However, Zac - who completed a stint in rehab in 2013 for unspecified reasons - wasn't seen at the bash.

Zac Efron 'thinking about' High School Musical reunion film
Zac Efron admits he's ''thinking about'' a 'High School Musical' reunion movie with his former co-stars.
Zac Efron is ''thinking about'' a 'High School Musical' reunion movie.
The 26-year-old actor was catapulted to the spotlight in 2006's hit film where he played popular student and captain of the varsity basketball team, Troy Bolton, alongside Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale .
The hunk claims he still meets up with his former co-stars, who've never forgotten the experience they shared, and insists their reunions take them back to the days when they worked together.
He told E! News: ''We're all thinking about it [reunion movie].
''I continue to see all the guys from 'High School'.
''Every time we do [meet up]... there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience. It brings you right back to those days.''
Efron will next hit the big screen in comedy 'Neighbors', where he plays the president of a fraternity, alongside Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne who have been cast as a married couple.
He added: ''It was neat. For me it was essentially the same as filming a drama. They took it really seriously.
''For us, we really had a fraternity. We really made it into a fraternity. It was kind of method. It really was. It was just so much fun.''

Is a High School Musical reunion actually going to happen? According to Zac Efron it might--well, he's all in for it, anyway. Don't tease us, Zac. We're fragile about all things HSM, so don't make empty promises, okay?
In a new interview with E! News , Zac dished that he would "100 percent" do a High School Musical reunion movie, adding, "We're all thinking about it." Thinking and doing are two different things, unfortunately, but we want to believe this will happen.
Has the HSM cast talked about the reunion? Well...not exactly, as Zac shared, "I continue to see all the guys from High School. Every time we do...there's just this look between us. It's so cool because we never forget a single moment of that experience."
In other important news, Zac tweeted this in a bid to earn your vote for the MTV Movie Award's Best Shirtless Performance category: "If I beat Thor--I'm accepting the award shirtless on stage. #movieawards"

Did the temperature just rise in Austin, Texas???
Sure feels like it after Zac Efron made his appearance at the premiere of Neighbors at SXSW !
The still healthy and hot actor showed up on the red carpet alongside Seth Rogen and Dave Franco , but he could've been next to a three-headed Big Foot and we would've only noticed our fave cutie!
But more importantly than how delish and dashing he looks, he's also feeling great. We couldn't be happier to hear he's in a happy place as he told the audience:
"I've been blessed to have the opportunities I've had. It couldn't have happened better. I'm stoked."
We're stoked too!
After a rough last year, Zac has clearly bounced back with his priorities in the right place.
Although, we're still pretty sure the right place for Zac is on our arm!!

Efron: Rogen was my God

Zac Efron had major nerves around Neighbors co-star Seth Rogen.

Zac Efron
Zac Efron had major nerves around Neighbors co-star Seth Rogen.
The pair co-star in forthcoming comedy Neighbors, about a couple with a newborn baby who move in next door to a fraternity house.
At a screening of the film in Austin, Texas Saturday night, Zac admitted he was a ball of anxiety when he first approached Seth at a party a few years ago.
"I was so nervous," Zac told People.com
"He was sort of my God. It was at the Sunset Towers, I was 17 or 18, I idolised him at this point. I stopped him and told him, 'Seth, I have to tell you I'm a huge fan.'"
"I thought you were too young to see my movies," Seth mused. "Did your mom take you?"
Zac, now 26, plays frat boy Teddy Sanders in the film.
And director Nick Stoller had nothing but compliments for the former High School Musical star.
"Zac was super funny. For the fraternity, we wanted everyone to have a comic energy that was different from one another but still meshed,  he said, adding that Zac fit the bill.
The actor is meanwhile thrilled to still be on top in Hollywood, seeming to have navigated the slippery transition from child star to adult actor.
"I've been blessed to have the opportunities I've had,  he said.
"It couldn't have happened better. I'm stoked."
Neighbors opens in US cinemas May 9.

Comic film  Neighbours  pits party-over against party-on
Monday March 10, 2014
Print Article
Seth Rogen speaks during The Comedy Central Roast of James Franco at Culver Studios on August 25, 2013 in Culver City, California.   AFP picAUSTIN, March 10   It s OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so.
As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie,  Neighbours,  that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.
Packed with crowd-pleasing Rogen-style jokes   including a cringe-worthy bumble with a breast pump   the war spirals into depravity between new parents Mac and Kelly Radner and the Delta Psi Beta frat next door, led by its slightly damaged president, Teddy, portrayed by Zac Efron.
But as Mac and Kelly, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, find themselves trying to shut down raging parties they would have loved to attend when they were 10 years younger, the film s biggest battle turns out to be internal.
It is the one fought by anyone afraid to grow up, or who cannot figure out how to make a comfortable transition to  get-off-my-lawn  adulthood out of an irresponsible youth they are sorry to see disappear.
 When you have a kid, that s great, and obviously amazing, but as special as it is, it does destroy a part of your previous life,  Rogen, 31, a co-producer of the movie, told Reuters yesterday in an interview after the movie s first public screening.  That s probably good in some ways, but it s also a bummer in some ways. 
Early reviews have been largely positive, with critics appreciating the movie s nonstop jokes in a film Variety senior features writer Andrew Barker describes as  lewder, weirder, louder, leaner, meaner and more winningly stupid  than previous Stoller or Rogen efforts. The film opens in North American theatres on May 9.
The audience in Austin laughed and cheered through most of the antics, including the moment the baby sticks the used condom into her mouth after the frat boys fling it onto the lawn.
Mac and Kelly s frantic debate over how to say  keep it down  in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?
 I KNOW THESE GUYS 
The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are   not to mention their own fans.
 All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying,  Rogen said with a laugh.  That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that s when the movie, I think, took a great shape. 
Byrne s likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the  Bridesmaids  actress.
Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy s girlfriend to betray him.
Efron, characterised by Variety s Barker as giving  one of his most credible and intriguing performances  as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character.
Where Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying   and that gives him depth, Efron said.
He credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy s multi-faceted character.
 We were able to kind of find the heart in it,  Efron, 26, said.  I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I ve felt those feelings. 
It is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up.   Reuters

Bad Neighbours review - Seth Rogen and Zac Efron gross but great
4 / 5 stars
Bad Neighbours pits family man Seth Rogen against a fraternity lead by Zac Efron s handsome dummy. It s Project X crashing a Joe Swanberg movie
Naughty but nice Neighbors   Zac Efron, Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. Photograph: Courtesy of Universal Pictures

First published on Sunday 9 March 2014 17.44 EDT
Seth Rogen s being a grown-up again. Fear not, those who remember Ro-Bro s crying scene in Take This Waltz   this time the relationship stuff is played way down in the dirt. Bad Neighbours   writer-director Nicholas Stoller s smart, disgusting gutter-dweller   has little time for the intricacies of long-term love and commitment. Instead it crashes Project X into a Joe Swanberg movie, invites it to chug the drinks and throw up all over the rug.
Rogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac and Kelly, new parents who go to war against the college fraternity that have moved in next door. Head of the frat pack is Zac Efron as Teddy, a sweet-natured lunk who doesn t want to keep the couple s baby awake, but can t pass up an opportunity to party.
Pinterest
Stoller   the long-term Apatow collaborator who also had a hand in 2011 s Muppets revamp   has always been good at mixing profanity and pathos. His directorial debut, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, hid a sincere romantic drama behind all the dick jokes. Neighbors is far less subtle, barely bothering to check if its dignity s in place before leaping into the next filthy setup.
Rogen and Byrne have great chemistry as the thirtysomethings anxious to do right by their daughter, look cool in front of the kids and still get invited to party like they used to. Byrne s role is meatier than most comedies   even Apatow comedies   allow their female stars. Kelly is as conniving as Mac, equally keen to get one over the college kids by doing something moronic. They re a very likable couple, both as tempted by the hard partying lifestyle of Teddy and co as they are dismissive of it.
Pinterest
Efron is strangely blank for the alpha-male leader of a group of marauding teens, but his support   including Dave Franco as his big-brained lieutenant, Pete, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse as  blessed  numbskull Scoonie   pick up the slack. Submarine s Craig Roberts pops up in a charming little role as a wannabe frat member. He s full of conflicted emotions about his place in the all-male society, unsure how the house s intensely homo-social heirarchy chimes with his need for independence. His character is called Assjuice.
Bad Neighbours needs a tuck. The pacing is wobbly, the targets are too big. There are some lazy gags about post-natal sex ( she s got these huge tits, but she insists on wearing a wife-beater. It s like fucking Tony Soprano! ) and too much focus on Scoonie s schlong. But it s also an extremely funny comedy that pushes Rogen s instinctive good nature to the limit. His stoner schtick helps to take the edge off much of the film s crassness and gives it back some charm.
  This review was first published to coincide with the SXSW premiere of Bad Neighbours

For those who care about films in the slightest, South by Southwest is the place to be this week. The conference, which runs March 7th through March 16th in Austin, Texas, is the place for enthusiasts to see the latest films, get album previews and generally have tons of fun. So, four days into SXSW, what are the highlights?
The VM cast was out in full force at SXSW.
First of all, there was Seth Rogen and Zac Efron  s Neighbors, which pits Rogen against Efron in a battle for dominance over a suburban street. In this comedy, directed by Nicholas Stoller from a script by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O Brien, Rogen plays one half of a newly married couple, who are just settling into their cozy suburban nest. Efron and his band of frat boys, however, are there to ruin everything. According to THR , Neighbors got big laughs at its Paramount Theater premiere, so it might be one to look out for later in the year.

Comic film 'Neighbors' pits party-over against party-on
FULL COVERAGE:
By Karen Brooks | AUSTIN, Texas
AUSTIN, Texas It's OK to grow up. Even Seth Rogen says so.
As a married former party guy transitioning into suburban parenthood, Rogen wages war with the frat house next door in the raucous new Nicholas Stoller movie, "Neighbors," that screened this weekend as a work in progress at the SXSW Film Festival.

Mac and Kelly's frantic debate over how to say "keep it down" in a cool way was a crowd favorite, highlighting a question asked by many in the fight against growing older: when did we stop being cool?
'I KNOW THESE GUYS'
The inspiration for the focus on growing pains was largely autobiographical, Rogen said. He and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien are of similar age and going through the same life changes as Mac and Kelly are - not to mention their own fans.
"All of a sudden it just started to seem like we were more likely to be the ones calling the cops on the kids partying than to be the kids partying," Rogen said with a laugh. "That to us was really fertile and original and something we all really related to, and once we started having those conversations, that's when the movie, I think, took a great shape."
Byrne's likable portrayal of Kelly as an enthusiastic partner in revenge earned critical accolades for the "Bridesmaids" actress.
Kelly Radner is not your typical stick-in-the-mud movie wife trying to get her immature husband to quit messing with the frat boys. She helps defeat them, even calling on her old hot-girl skills to get Teddy's girlfriend to betray him.
Efron, characterized by Variety's Barker as giving "one of his most credible and intriguing performances" as the charismatic Teddy, said he found him to be a surprisingly complex character.
Where Mac the new dad may find the prospect of adulthood to be gratifying if confusing, for Teddy, president of the frat that claims to have invented beer pong, the thought of growing up is flat-out terrifying - and that gives him depth, Efron said.
He credited collaboration with Rogen and others in helping him adequately deliver Teddy's multi-faceted character.
"We were able to kind of find the heart in it," Efron, 26, said. "I have a couple of friends like this, and Teddy is sort of a mixture of their best and worst qualities. I know these guys. I've felt those feelings."
It is OK, and it can even be cool, to grow up.

SXSW got off to a roaring start yesterday afternoon (well, start for me; the festival proper kicked off Friday) for a couple reasons. First was the rain, which wasn t quite  roaring  but was plenty cold and wet enough to be despised by all in line. Second was Neighbors, a comedy of young couple meets frat house starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron. There are definitely traces of Judd Apatow influence, which makes sense given that the writer, director, and at least a plurality of the producers have been involved projects from the Apatow circle of friends, but Neighbors is probably the freshest, funniest R-comedy to appear since the first Hangover. The packed Paramount theater where the film was screened, not a small venue, was roaring through basically the whole debut.
And this was technically just a public debut, not a premier, because the version we were shown was called a  work in progress,  but some color and sound balance aside, this looks pretty much done. Some of the cast and production team did a short Q&A after the screening, and they said there are still a couple minor cuts to be made, but my guess is this is as much about cleaning up transitions as it is cutting material.
A full review is incoming in the near future, but for now suffice it to say that Efron and Rogen seem perfectly cast. That douche Efron was playing in That Awkward Moment? This is his funnier, dumber (literally, but also in a good way), crazier college doppelganger, and he actually fits the narrative this time around. Rogen is also treading somewhat familiar territory here as the adult who still wants to party every now and then, but he does it really well. Rose Byrne is a great addition as Rogen s wife, as is Ike Bairnholtz as Rogen s friend and coworker who absolutely steals a few of the scenes he s in. Also a shout out to the baby as one of the cutest, most emotive film babies I can ever remember.
This movie strikes exactly the ridiculous tone you d expect from a film with the premise of a war between a frat house and their slightly more well, no not any more responsible neighbors, but that s a really good thing. The production leans into the just-beyond-believable ridiculousness of it all, and   I can t believe I m saying this   should be commended for keeping its requisite character development and associated somber moments to a minimum and mostly out of the way. Guys, this was a really fun film.
Fun fact: of all the principle cast, none of them went to college, and of the main production team, only one was actually in a frat.

SXSW 2014 Review: NEIGHBORS Goes Directly For The Raunch
Tweet 0 Submit 1
To put it bluntly, asking why things happen in Hollywood studio comedies is besides the point. It's all about getting to the funny as expeditiously and as often as possible.
Neighbors, a new Hollywood studio comedy by Nicholas Stoller, quickly untethers from reality. Thus freed from the burdens of narrative logic and/or character development, the comic talents of Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron, Ike Barinholtz, and others are allowed to float free and act on their impulses in an 'anything goes' atmosphere -- the raunchier the better.
Director Stoller and writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien are graduates of the Judd Apatow school of studio humor, and so are well-versed in cooking up a comedy that adheres to a certain recipe: bookending the picture with big set-pieces, and then linking those set-pieces with a series of fast-paced episodes that rely chiefly on sight gags and as many obscenities as possible. The pace rarely flags; it feels like a feature-length, stand-up comedy routine that just happens to involve a large company of players.
Rogen and Byrne play Mac and Kelly, a married couple with a newborn child. They have just purchased a lovely new home -- don't ask how they can afford it on the salary of one lower-level employee working in an office environment -- and are still adjusting to the responsibilities and challenges of parenthood. Then a fraternity, led by Teddy (Efron) and Pete (Dave Franco), buys the house next door -- don't ask why a college fraternity would buy a house in a quiet residential neighborhood -- and immediately starts throwing wild and very noisy parties. Mac and Kelly try to make nice with their new neighbors so they can get some sleep, and end up partying all night long with the boys. When they call the cops on the fraternity for another loud party the next night, though, Teddy vows revenge, and the feud is on.
It's all very, very silly; nothing, be it a one-liner or a bit of visual humor, is too broad or vulgar or cruel to be excluded, and, as noted, it's all delivered at a very rapid rate, so while the occasional groaner may provoke a moment of silence, the silence is then swallowed up by the next joke. And, obviously, it's all dependent on the viewer sharing a comic sensibility with the filmmakers. If not, Neighbors would be a painful experience.
To a large extent, Rogen and Efron are known quantities; Rogen does what he normally does, to good effect, and Efron takes off his shirt a lot. So the true pleasure here is watching Rose Byrne take full advantage of her opportunity to shine comedically. She's demonstrated an adroit ability to give her own spin to comedy in past roles, but seeing her often get the better of Rogen in their mano a mano scenes, or, especially, a scene at a party that she absolutely smokes, gives the movie an extra adult jolt beyond the oft-juvenile proceedings.
Neighbors is not the brightest or longest-lasting bulb in the Hollywood studio comedy firmament, but it works hard to ensure that its light-hearted, dirty-minded humor fills the picture from beginning to end.
Note: The film screened at SXSW as a work-in-progress, missing the credits, a final sound mix, and little trims here and there, according to the director in the post-screening Q&A. Neighbors will open wide in theaters across the U.S. on May 9, 2014. Visit the official site for more information .

Zach Efron, Seth Rogen, and Dave Franco Brought Some Testosterone to SXSW
Jason Marshall | March 9, 2014 - 3:30 pm
Share < br />this article:
Zac Efron , Seth Rogen , and Dave Franco  made that happen and brought along their new flick  Neighbors.
Noticeably absent was Rose Byrne, who stars in the movie as Seth s wife and appears to be the only actress in the film. She and Rogen face off against Franco and Efron after they move their Frat House in next door.
Minus the ladies though, Zac seemed to make time for the fans outside the theatre.
And along with the premiere, Mr. Efron tweeted an image of himself filming a segment for Funny or Die . Stay tuned for it, because I m sure we ll be on top of that when it makes its way to the internet.

Summary:
Come for the beer pong, stay for the blacklight dance party, and enjoy every minute of this ridiculous fraternity comedy featuring hilariously "broish" performances that embrace every enjoyable stereotype.
More Details
Based on the merits of being a  How To  guide for aspiring parents, Neighbors is a one star movie about two adults selfishly putting their own insecurities before the well-being of their newborn baby. We re talking some gratuitously debaucherous middle-aged partying including magic mushrooms, sword fighting, shot ripping, and every other fraternal stereotype possible. Wildly inappropriate, of course, but with Nicholas Stoller s outlandish direction, Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O Brien watch their screenplay turn into a riotous Greek life comedy that ll make you question every responsible decision you made throughout your college career. Stoller himself admitted that only one member of his production team actually lived a fraternity life in college, so you can imagine the generalizations and stereotypes blown wildly out of proportion, but it s all in the name of comedy   and the most epic rager that frat life could possibly imagine.
Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are new parents enjoying their more modest suburban lifestyle, embracing early nights and child care instead of raves and late night diner trips. Their life is your simple blue-collar affair, and their neighborhood equatable to Anywhere, USA   until a fraternity moves in next door. Led by President Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and his Vice President Pete (Dave Franco), this is your Animal House style fraternity with the dial cranked even higher, as it s Teddy s mission to earn his rightful place on the frat s Hall of Fame board, along with the supposed inventors of the Toga Party and every college kid s best friend, the Boot and Rally. This doesn t bode well for the Radner s humble lifestyle, so they decide to fight back. Can Mac and Kelly party hard enough to infiltrate the frat and get them evicted? If there s one brotherhood you should avoid starting a war with, it s an immature, vengeful frat   something that the Radners are about to find out.
Graduating from High School Musical heartthrob to full-blown college douche, Zac Efron was meant to play the testosterone-charged frat superhero Teddy Sanders. Efron has never been funnier, and getting away from his  good guy  persona creates a completely embellished caricature that s entirely too much fun to ignore, pairing nicely with his second-in-command played by Dave Franco   another young actor who pops his collar and leaves us in stitches. The chemistry between these two is highlighted by a scene I can only dream was improvised on set, recording Teddy and Pete s genius reinventions of the phrase  bros before hos    only to have Pete heartbroken later when Teddy doesn t acknowledge the  bropology  that took place, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT RHYMED! Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Jerrod Carmichael round out our alpha dogs, one a certifiable porn star and the other a hopeless pothead, but it s Teddy and Pete who ultimately win us over through wicked epicness   that s what the kids say these days, right?
As for Rogen and Byrne   where do I start? Again, for any aspiring parents at home, you ll have to understand the fact that Neighbors is meant to be nothing but drunken fun, and it succeeds mightily. The Radners leave their child at home for an entire night full of fraternity partying, and get sufficiently intoxicated, but everything is alright because Rose has her baby monitor. DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME   but please witness the utter hilarity that our bored couple creates.
Neighbors is essentially pornography for adults who fantasize about reliving their glory years, now unable to slug Jager and take two story bong rips, as those viewers can live vicariously through Rogen and Byrne   a comedic dream couple. Whether it s Rogen dancing his ass off while wearing a goofy gansta  hat or Byrne turning from innocent housewife into manipulative female she-demon, these two talents riff off one another with perfect comedic ease, again aiding Stoller s admittedly overplayed mentality. Oh, and Byrne   please stick to only horror and comedy from here on out. Please?!
As for the party-hearty shenanigans throughout Neighbors, Stoller and company create every college boy s fantasy while also somehow addressing fears that come along with leaving college   albeit nothing but surface recognition. You re here to laugh, and watching Rogen attempt to keep up with Efron delivers  first pot brownie  hilarity. Blacklights, kegs, drugs, sorority girls, bro bonding, tank tops, Robert De Niro themed parties   Neighbors goes for broke and succeeds in creating one of the funniest fraternal comedies since Animal House   the Holy Grail of college humor. Stoller s complete disregard for reality is his greatest weapon, subduing audiences with masculine hugs and spot on sight gags that again live in some fantasy world where airbags can hide in chairs, launching unknowing victims into crumbly tile ceilings. Nothing will make you miss college more until you realize your college life was nothing like Teddy s   and then you ll just want to pull an Old School.
Neighbors is like walking into a frat party and witnessing a game of beer pong between Willie Nelson, Kenny Powers, and the Coors Light commercial twins   it s probably just a hallucinogenic tease brought on by some  party favors  you popped earlier, but for the time being, it s nothing but pure, entertaining bliss. Attacking  bro  culture with the energy of a  roided out grizzly bear, Stoller pushes comedy farther than he s ever attempted, an easy achievement with such a star-studded comedic cast. Efron is a pastel plastered revelation, and has honestly never been funnier   the same goes for Byrne, minus the abs and plus a maternal surprise. Sure, there s a paper-thin story that doesn t really strike the serious notes of maturing, growing older, and accepting a more  normal  life   but with non-stop laughs and gut-busting highlights, Neighbors is a death cup victory on Team Stoller s first pong shots.

"Who here is a little bit drunk?"
And to that question, damn near everyone in attendance at last night's Neighbors world premiere screening at the SXSW Film Festival broke out in thunderous applause. And we're talking upwards of 1,000 rowdy cinephiles, too, being that Neighbors was unveiled at Austin's Paramount Theatre, a 1,100-seat venue that resembles one of those old-school opera houses, complete with side balconies and an upper seating level.
The man asking the question: director Nicholas Stoller, getting the crowd hyped up for his new movie's first-ever screening. Stoller's back at SXSW after the successful 2008 premiere of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his directorial debut prefacing Get Him to the Greek. Where Sarah Marshall was a raucous but often tender look at failed love and loneliness, Neighbors is a totally different beast. Foul-mouthed, kinetic, and lean (clocking in at a just-right 95 minutes), it's consistently hilarious come May 9, when Neighbors officially opens theatrically, it will be the funniest movie a major Hollywood studio (in this case, Universal Pictures) will have released since 2012's Jump Street.
There was hardly a quiet moment throughout the screening, due in large part to the film's loaded cast, all of whom are on the entire time. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Mac and Kelly Rdner, a happily married couple trying to keep the flame going despite the fact that they're raising an infant girl, Stella (a natural born scene-stealer if there ever was one). To complicate their domestic life, Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity made up of mostly dim-witted meatheads, moves into the house next door, turning Teddy and Kelly's neighborhood into a 24/7 reenactment of National Lampoon's Animal House. Led by president Teddy (Zac Efron) and his VP, Pete (Dave Franco), the frat dudes go to the extremes of partying at one point, they turn their entire home into a "hotbox house," which, yes, is close what it sounds like, only much more set-design ambitious. It doesn't help Mac's situation that Teddy's beyond ripped, with arms that, as Mac puts it, look like "two big veiny dicks."
Neighbors is, for the most part, a tightly connected series of sight gags and profane one-liners, but unlike most Hollywood comedies, very few of the film's jokes miss. It'd be too obvious to single out Rogen's performance, even though he hasn't been this funny on-screen since Knocked Up. An ensemble piece, Neighbors features two unexpected MVP performances from Dave Franco and Rose Byrne. Franco, playing off of the similarly impressive against-type Efron, gets just as many strong punch-lines as Rogen, while Byrne never lets the dominant comedic force who's playing her fictional other-half overshadow her. In fact, she got the premiere's biggest round of applause, coming after a set-piece in which Mac and Kelly strategically turn Teddy and Pete against each other by challenging the old "bros before hoes" conceit.
Byrne's big moment happens in the midst of one of the film's many frat house raves, all of which radiate with flashing neon lights, energetic handheld camerawork, and unruly close-ups and camera angles. During the post-screening Q&A, for which the entire cast minus Rose Byrne participated, Stoller cited the 2009 French head-trip film Enter the Void  as a "visual touchstone" used by he and director of photography Brandon Trost for the Neighbors party scenes, and it shows.
Not that Stoller or any of his cast were able to bring any personal experiences to those sequences, though. While introducing the film, Stoller dedicated it to producer James Weaver, the only person involved with Neighbors who was ever in a fraternity. "The rest of us," said Stoller, "were Jews and child stars. Thank you, James, for explaining to me what an elephant walk is."
Once the movie ended, Stoller hopped back on stage along with the entire cast. Unsurprisingly, that's when Seth Rogen took over the proceedings. The first question came from one rather enthusiastic audience member, a guy who stepped into one of the aisles to make sure Rogen and company could clearly see him. "That was one of the best movies I've ever seen," he said, spending a solid 60 seconds repeating that sentiment with different phrasings. At his final "best movie ever" exclamation, Rogen didn't waste a second. "I'm gonna fuck the shit out of that guy! The second this is over!"
The only time one of Rogen's responses earned a larger outburst of clapping than that? When another audience member cited a bit in Neighbors where Rogen and Efron's characters, both excessively drunk and high, discuss their personal favorite Batmans the older Mac prefers Michael Keaton and the much younger Teddy likes Christian Bale. The question for Rogen was, simply, "Who's Batman to you?" Showing love to Keaton, he asked the crowd, "Who here like the George Clooney Batman? Absolutely no one."
The Q&A as a whole, not unlike Neighbors itself, maintained that kind of random humor. Barely any of the audience's questions pertained directly to the movie. One obnoxious guy, for shame, asked the cast and crew if they'd take an "epic selfie" like Ellen Degeneres' at the Academy Awards fortunately, Rogen quickly shot that request down.
The last question of the night: "Will there be a sequel?"
"No," said Rogen. "First this one needs to make money, and none of you paid to be here, as far as I know."
"So, basically," continued Stoller, "it hasn't made any money yet."

SXSW 2014: Neighbors   Zac Efron, Christopher  by CraveOnline
If you have neighbors, you may very well love  Neighbors , the new comedy from director Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) that stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as first-time parents who get into a turf war with a wild fraternity led by Zac Efron (That Awkward Moment), Dave Franco (Now You See Me), Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Kick-Ass 2).
Neighbors premiered to raucous laughter at SXSW 2014 last night, and we've already got the young cast together for an exclusive interview about their new comedy, their real life next-door-living people, their complete lack of experience with actual fraternities, Matthew McConaughey for some reason, and why this is Zac Efron's favorite experience making a movie.

He's certainly got more than a few adoring fans in Texas.
And they turned out to greet Zac Efron when he arrived at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Saturday.
The star was travelling to Austin for the world premiere of his comedy Bad Neighbors at the South By Southwest Film Conference And Festival, better known as SXSW.

Fan favourite: Zac was greeted by a throng of adoring fans at the Texas airport
Also making the trek separately from Los Angeles were co-stars Seth Rogen and Dave Franco, who didn't get quite the same warm welcome.
Zac, 26, chose comfort over style for the flight, wearing a dark grey wool bomber jacket over a light grey T-shirt and well-worn jeans paired with brown shoes.
The That Awkward Moment star pulled a black beanie over his head and smiled broadly at fans who had gathered outside the airport to see him.
Write stuff: Seth Rogen didn't appear to get the same warm welcome as Zac but he must have got some love from fans as he was carrying a pen ready to sign autographs
It's not so bad: The 31-year-old actor looked surprised as he was handed a pen as he walked across the concourse
Film premiere: Zac, Seth and Dave teamed up at the premiere of Neighbors at the film festival
Fun role: Zac has a starring role in the comedy about a couple with a newborn who move next to a fraternity house
Fans galore: Zac posed for selfies with his fans at the premiere
The actor put his arm around one lucky girl as she reached up with her cell phone to take a picture as he walked along.
Seth Rogen also opted for casual clothing for the trip. The 31-year-old donned a black sweater over a grey T-shirt and light grey jeans. His flat cap added a splash of colour to his outfit and he slung a rucksack on his back.

The movie, titled Neighbors for SXSW, is set to play at the festival today before a general release in the US on May 9.
SXSW, which runs until next Friday, has become an increasingly important showcase for studios to roll out films. Last year, nearly 75,000 people converged on Austin for the film festival, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Keeping it low-key: Things were a lot quieter when the heartthrob left Los Angeles International Airport

Do you know who is REALLY funny in Nicholas Stoller s Neighbors ? Like, "steal the show" funny?
Zac Efron .
I can hear you bitching and moaning already. Save it. Efron uses every tool in his box to keep up with (and often ahead of) a fast-and-filthy talking Seth Rogen as Neighbors works up a disgustingly funny lather. The raunchy rival comedy held a work-in-progress screening at the Paramount Theater during South By Southwest , and while the MPAA might ask for a few cuts (there are a LOT of dick jokes), the version we saw will light theaters on fire when Neighbors opens this summer.
Stoller brought Forgetting Sarah Marshall to this fest back in 2008, and called that screening "the best" of his career. This one might top it. The Paramount crowd roared as Rogen and Rose Byrne stepped into the roles of new parents Mac and Kelly Radnor, suburbanites worried that their newborn baby girl (played by a ridiculously adorable and expressive infant) will drag them kicking and screaming into adulthood. As if parenting isn t hard enough, the Radnors must contend with their new neighbors   the men of a local college fraternity led by cocky, manipulative Teddy (Efron).
Neighbors goes beyond the easy Geeks vs. Greeks, recognizing that it has some deeply funny people at its disposal  and those actors already are finding themselves at personal crossroads that come with age. Rogen and Byrne alternate from terrified to jealous as they leer at Efron, Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and the well-endowed frat dudes. (Why Rogen and his crew are obsessed with male genitalia remains beyond me.) But neither group is detestable because Stoller makes all of these characters relatable. Old fogies like myself will want Mac and Kelly to maintain the upper hand over these punk assholes. Byrne might have earned the film s loudest cheer when a vengeance plan she enacts over Franco and Efron falls into place. But the Greeks get their laughs, as well  as when they sneak air bags into Rogen s seats (a visual gag that made it into the film s trailers).
Stoller could trim the run time of Neighbors, as the back-and-forth between the warring parties goes from inspired to childish and more than a bit exhausting. But the film has multiple, huge laughs. It plays extremely well with a crowd who is plugged in to the anarchistic rivalry. But it s also one of those relentlessly dirty comedies that you ll watch on cable months after you belly laughed through it with your friends and wonder what, exactly, was so hysterical.

House Of Cards Comes To Comcast Xfinity Service
It is a bit ironic that Netflix while locked in a battle with cable companies for viewers eyeballs, and depending on them for most of their content, are now making money by selling it back to them.
For Comcast subscribers who have resisted the temptation to get a Netflix account, hit shows such as House of Cards can now be watched, although you will need to pay for it through the Xfinity Store.
Comcast have signed a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, who manage international and home video distribution for the hit political series. But the show which convinced many viewers to sign up to a Netflix subscription plan, can now be accessed without joining up.
Comcast are making available the first season one of the political drama series starring Kevin Spacey, and they are not stopping there. They have also revealed that in a seperate deal with Lionsgate, they will be offering another Netflix original,  Orange is the New Black in May.
The Xfinity Store is Comcast s pay-as-you-watch service for streaming content, letting customers buy movies and TV shows and stream them on a number of connected devices.
The deal is important, because it means that Comcast viewers need not miss out on award winning shows that are now not exclusive to Netflix. Although looking deeper into the deal, it is not great value for money. Although exact prices are not yet known, Comcast will probably charge $1.99-$2.99 per episode, whereas Netflix costs $8 per month with unlimited streaming, and access to the second season .
But if it means Comcast can convince viewers to not   cut-the-cord   then it will be a job well done. House of Cards is also available on Blu-ray and DVD as well as from other online retailers such as Amazon Instant Video.

Comcast boosts digital store with Sony deal
March 11, 2014
21 Jump Street
Comcast is to sell Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (SPHE) titles through its Xfinity On Demand digital store. In the coming weeks, Xfinity TV customers will be able to purchase Sony Pictures movies and TV shows to own and access anytime, anywhere, on any device, often before the DVD release.
Michael Schreiber, Senior Vice President of Content Acquisition at Comcast Cable, described the Sony Pictures library as  a terrific addition  to its rapidly-expanding offering of hit films and TV shows available for purchase,  The response to the digital store has been encouraging and tells us our customers love the flexibility and ease of purchasing content directly from Xfinity On Demand to watch when and where they want it,  he added.
 Sony Pictures is pleased that this agreement brings significant titles to Comcast customers,  said Man Jit Singh, SPHE President.  We deeply value our relationship with Comcast and look forward to working closely with them to meet the needs of all audiences. 
Among the first titles available for purchase will be the multi-Academy Award nominated American Hustle which will be available to own digitally on March 11th.
Additional Sony Pictures movie and TV titles that will be available for purchase in the coming weeks include the critically-acclaimed TV series Breaking Bad, as well as popular movies such as Captain Phillips, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, The Amazing Spiderman and 21 Jump Street.
The Comcast catalogue now includes content from FOX, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros.

Comcast customers can now watch House of Cards without a Netflix subscription. Thanks to a new agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, the cable provider is selling season one of the political drama series through its Xfinity Store. Netflix holds exclusive streaming rights for House of Cards, which has become a staple of its original programming lineup. But Sony manages international and home video distribution for the series; the first season was  quietly released on Blu-ray and DVD back in June   without any extras or a single piece of bonus content. The first season is also available to purchase digitally from Amazon Instant Video and Vudu, among other retailers. Episodes can be purchased from Comcast individually or as a bundle.
But Comcast's attempt to ride Netflix's coattails doesn't end with House of Cards. The company has also announced that it will be offering Orange is the New Black starting in May. That's possible through a separate distribution deal with Lionsgate.  Comcast's Xfinity Store lets customers buy movies and TV shows and watch them across various devices. But videos aren't compatible with UltraViolet, and you risk losing access in certain scenarios if you terminate Comcast service. We'd recommend simply buying a Netflix subscription if you want to watch Netflix shows (especially since streaming speeds on Comcast  should be getting better ). Comcast's deal with Sony also includes early-release movies for the Xfinity Store, which will give its customers a chance to purchase select films before they reach Blu-ray and DVD.
Update: The article has been updated to mention that House of Cards is already available from other digital retailers.

Comcast broadband subscribers are already enjoying better Netflix streaming performance just two weeks after the companies struck an agreement to directly connect their networks -- and Netflix says even better performance is on the way.
In its latest ISP speed index released Monday, Netflix said that prime-time video streams on Comcast averaged 1.68Mbps in February, up from 1.51Mbps in January, reversing months of steady declines and boosting Comcast's ranking by two spots on the list. Prior to February, the average performance of Netflix streaming video content delivered to Comcast subscribers declined by more than 25% over the last few months. As recently as October of last year, Netflix was streaming at 2.07Mbps.
As part of the deal -- known as a paid-peering or transit agreement -- Netflix gained a direct connection to the Comcast's network, bypassing bandwidth providers that operate as third-party intermediaries between residential broadband companies and Internet firms. Financial terms of the arrangement were not disclosed. The pact was announced on February 23 and the improved connections began several days before that, but the performance increases will take some time before they're fully felt by all Netflix users with Comcast service.

Despite the boost in performance, Comcast remains below the U.S. streaming average of 1.95Mbps, but further improvements are on the way, per Netflix. "We do expect to see Comcast s performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data as a result of the recent agreement between Netflix and Comcast," Joris Evers, director of communications at Netflix, wrote in a company blog post.
Google Fiber, the tech giant's gigabit broadband service, remains by far the fastest U.S. provider of Netflix streaming video, with average performance of 3.74Mbps, according to the company. In the blog post, Netflix called Google Fiber "the guiding North Star for broadband performance in the country." Google has already launched fiber initiatives in Kansas City , Austin and Provo , and last month announced plans to work with nine more metro areas to expand the service.
Among major U.S. broadband providers, Verizon DSL is the slowest, with average performance of 0.93Mbps. Verizon's high-speed FiOS service is slightly faster than Comcast at 1.76Mbps, but that service continues to decline in the rankings, as does AT&T U-verse, which clocked in at 1.66 Mbps.
In the wake of Netflix's deal with Comcast, Verizon and AT&T both acknowledged that they are seeking to reach an agreement with the streaming video service. As high-bandwidth services like Netflix have exploded in popularity, the broadband companies are increasingly seeking compensation in exchange for direct connections to improve performance.
Netflix says its ISP speed index is "based on data from the more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide who view over 1 billion hours of TV shows and movies streaming from Netflix each month. The listed speeds reflect the average performance of all Netflix streams on each ISP's network and are an indicator of the performance typically experienced across all users on an ISP network. A faster network generally means a better picture quality, quicker start times and fewer interruptions."

Comcast March 10 said it has signed a license agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to sell the studio s titles through the Xfinity On Demand digital store.
Launched last fall, the Comcast digital store   the first for a cable operator   now includes content from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, Lionsgate, NBC Universal, Sony and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.
Among the first Sony titles available for purchase will be the multi-Academy Award-nominated American Hustle, which will be available to own digitally March 11   seven days ahead of its packaged-media launch.
Additional movies and TV titles available for purchase in the coming weeks include the critically-acclaimed TV series  Breaking Bad,  as well as movies Captain Phillips, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2, The Amazing Spider-Man and 21 Jump Street, among others.
Electronic sellthrough saw a 47% increase in consumer spending in 2013 to surpass $1 billion for the first time ever, according to DEG: The Digital Entertainment Group. Consumers spent $1.2 billion buying movies and TV shows digitally, up from $808 million in 2012.
 The Sony Pictures library is a terrific addition to our rapidly expanding offering of hit films and TV shows available for purchase,  Michael Schreiber, SVP of content acquisition at Comcast Cable, said in a statement.  The response to the digital store has been encouraging and tells us our customers love the flexibility and ease of purchasing content directly from Xfinity On Demand to watch when and where they want it. 
Comcast subscribers have the ability to purchase movies and television shows   often weeks before they are available to rent or purchase on Blu-ray and DVD   and store them in the cloud. Their content can be viewed on their TV, PC or mobile devices. Purchased titles are added to customers  On Demand menus, which are easily accessible on the TV, online or via the Xfinity On Demand Purchases app.
 Sony Pictures is pleased that this agreement brings significant titles to Comcast customers,  Man Jit Singh, president of SPHE, said in a statement.  We deeply value our relationship with Comcast and look forward to working closely with them to meet the needs of all audiences.

Comcast will soon stream House of Cards too, seemingly to spite Netflix
That's right, puny Netflix subscribers: Xfinity now has your show, too.
Mar 10, 2014 11:15 pm UTC
Frank's face, as usual, speaks volumes.
Netflix packets being dropped every day because Verizon wants more money
Comcast has scored another knife-twist on its semi-adversary, Netflix. The cable provider now allows customers to stream the first season of House of Cards from its Xfinity Store, according to a report from Variety. The new partnership comes just weeks after Comcast successfully persuaded Netflix to pay to improve the quality of its service for Comcast subscribers.
House of Cards was one of the first original series produced for and streamed on Netflix in a bulk serving of 13 episodes. The series was paid for in part by Netflix, reportedly to the tune of $100 million, but the price it paid did not cover rights that would prevent it from falling into Comcast's hands.
Media Rights Capital is the studio that made up the rest of the cost of the show, and it's handling distribution through Sony. Currently, House of Cards is also available on DVD, but not on any other streaming services.

Yoinks implies it's not on Netflix anymore, but from reading the article, I'm not seeing that anywhere.
And as AdamM said, it probably makes sense for season 1 to be made available outside of Netflix after a period of exclusivity.  If people like it, they can always pick up a Netflix subscription to get their hands on season 2.

House of Cards, the popular Netflix original that snubbed HBO for the Internet video streaming service, will soon be available to Comcast Xfinity subscribers who don t have a Netflix account. Such is the result of a recent deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, which handles certain elements of the show s distribution.
The deal applies for the first season of House of Cards, which allows Comcast subscribers to download the show via the relatively new Xfinity Store service on to their set-top box   no Netflix subscription is needed, a perk for those who don t want to double-down on their video subscriptions.
This joins the show s availability through VUDU and Amazon, as well, which sells the show out part-and-parcel at about $2 per episode. Those who want to check out the second season will still need Netflix for the time being, though that season will likely also find its way onto the VOD services in due time as well.
Those who enjoy Netflix s other popular original show  Orange is the New Black  will also be able to enjoy it through Comcast Xfinity starting May 13, which Variety reports is the result of a distribution deal with Lionsgate. Soon other Sony shows will be available through the service, as well, including The Amazing Spider-Man.

Looking to take on Amazon, Netflix and Apple, Comcast Corp. has signed a digital programming agreement with Sony Pictures Entertainment for the sale of movies and TV shows through Comcast s set-top boxes.
Comcast customers can now purchase movies like  American Hustle  and  Captain Phillips  via so-called  electronic sell-through  from Comcast digital s Xfinity Store, available on cable set-top boxes. Consumers can access titles ahead of the traditional video-on-demand rental window.
Television programming includes the high-profile "House of Cards," which runs on Netflix, which has the exclusive streaming rights to the show, as well as AMC's "Breaking Bad," which ended its TV run last summer.
Analysts believe Comcast s Xfinity Store is a growing alternative to Amazon, Netflix and Apple s iTunes. Recently, Warner Bros. also signed on as a partner to Comcast s Xfinity Store.
Comcast Cable Chief Executive Neil Smit made the announcement on Monday at the Deutsche Bank media conference in Palm Beach, Florida.
The deal prices Sony TV shows at $1.99 to $2.99 per episode, depending on high-definition or standard-definition formats.  Digital sales movies will range from $16.99 to $18.99 a movie.
Comcast consumers can view the content on TV through Comcast s Xfinity On Demand -- or on digital devices, a desktop/laptop computer from the Xfinity Web site and Xfinity On Demand app for iPhone, iPad and Android-based mobile devices.

Comcast Burns Netflix Again by Snagging House of Cards

House of Cards may have made Netflix s name as a source of must-see original content, but millions of Comcast customers aren t going to need Netflix to watch the show anymore.
In a deal with Sony, Comcast will now sell its subscribers access to the first season of the political drama through its own Xfinity Store, Variety reports . In Hollywood terms, the arrangement might not be anything remarkable   just a new way of syndicating reruns. But cutting Netflix out of the picture for its signature show sends a clear signal that the entertainment and cable industries aren t about to let some Northern California tech company change television without exacting a price.
Thanks to the company s aggressive marketing, House of Cards is known as a Netflix show just as much as The Sopranos was an HBO show. But even the $100 million it reportedly spent didn t buy Netflix all the rights to Frank Underwood s Machiavellian rise. Apparently, that money gave Netflix only the exclusive right to stream two seasons online first, and it didn t even cover the total production costs of the first 26 episodes. The rest of the costs fell on Media Rights Capital, the independent studio that actually made House of Card, and it is free to sell other rights.
To make its money back, the studio has a deal with Sony to handle distribution of House of Cards internationally and for  home video,  a term that in the Netflix streaming-video era seems meaningless. In practice, it means Sony gets to sell House of Cards DVDs and other ways for couch surfers to pay a la carte for the show, such as on Amazon Instant Video . That appears to be the kind of agreement Comcast struck with Sony, which also lets the cable provider offer access to Sony movies such as American Hustle ahead of other video-on-demand services.
For Comcast, the movies seem like the meat of the deal, while the House of Cards arrangement is more about sending a message to Netflix and the general public. The rise of Netflix and other streaming services have encouraged the rise of  cord-cutting,  which threatens the cable business, and Comcast isn t taking this laying down. Recently, Comcast exercised its own leverage by getting Netflix to pay for more direct access to Comcast s network, and now, the cable giant to making another move with its House of Cards deal, showing that it can cannibalize Netflix s business right back.
Not that a swarm of Comcast customers are about to go out and spend money to watch House of Cards somewhere other than Netflix   or at least they shouldn t. It s not clear how much Comcast plans to charge. But on Amazon, for instance, high-definition episodes are $2.99 a piece, or nearly $39 for the whole season. That s almost as much as five months of Netflix, which also includes season two, as well as Orange Is the New Black, another Netflix hit coming to Comcast soon. But just by making House of Cards an option, Comcast is eating into the brand identity Netflix is trying to establish for itself as the only place to watch  its  shows.
Original programming has become crucial to Netflix s business model . By getting House of Cards, Comcast sends a subtle signal to Netflix non-subscribers that maybe they don t need to spend that extra eight dollars a month after all. They might not actually pay Comcast to watch House of Cards either, but just knowing they could get the show there might be enough. On the other hand, if anyone does watch the first season of House of Cards on cable, Netflix still has a powerful advantage: the siren song of season two.

'House of Cards' Comes to Comcast Store
Posted Mon Mar 10, 2014 at 01:00 PM PDT                                  by Steven Cohen

Netflix Expands ISP Speed Index
Video Streamer Now Tracks 60 U.S. ISPs; Average Speed Of Comcast-Delivered Netflix Streams Rises Slightly 3/10/2014  3:30 PM Eastern
Follow @thebauminator
Netflix has expanded the number of U.S.-based broadband providers it tracks in its monthly ISP Speed Index   from 16 to 60   as it looks to cast a wider net and to  give credit where it is due  for some of the nation s smaller providers.
Netflix Open Connect member Cablevision Systems, with an average Netflix streaming speed of 2.94 Mbps) was tops among  major  U.S. ISPs tracked by Netflix , while Google Fiber (3.74 Mbps) retained its crown in the expanded listing, followed by Midcontinent Communications (2.98 Mbps), Cablevision, EPB (2.94 Mbps), Choice Cable Puerto Rico (2.92 Mbps) and RCN (2.92 Mbps).
Notably, Comcast, which is in the midst of its new interconnection deal with Netflix , held steady as 11th on the list among major ISPs, but its average speed rose to 3.78 Mbps, versus 3.74 Mbps in the previous period. Among other top providers, Verizon FiOS, Frontier Communications, AT&T U-verse, and Mediacom Communications all dropped one spot in the rankings.
 We do expect to see Comcast s performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data as a result of the recent agreement between Netflix and Comcast,  Netflix director of corporate communications Joris Evers explained.
Rounding out the bottom five of the expanded listings were: Bluebird Network (1.42 Mbps), AT&T DSL (1.12 Mbps), satellite broadband provider Hughes (1.05 Mbps), Clearwire (980 kbps) and Verizon DSL (930 kbps).
Among notable results elsewhere, BT jumped ahead of Virgin Media in the U.K.; and  UPC rose three spots (to number five) in the Netherlands.

Netflix further boasts improvements on Comcast this April
Comcast didn't crack the top 10 on Netflix's monthly ISP Speed Index, but that will almost certainly change by April.
| Topic: Networking
Netflix and Comcast recently came to terms in a widely-reported deal, the fruits of which should become evident to consumers very soon.
Read this
Netflix just released the figures for its monthly Internet Service Provider speed and performance update. Comcast didn't crack the top five, placing at 11th.
A two-spot improvement sequentially, but there is still some work cut out for mass media conglomerate.
Readers only casually familiar with Netflix (subscribers or not) might be surprised considering the recent hubbub about the online rental giant and the cable company trying to merge with Time Warner, which ranked fifth on its own.
But don't worry as that's all about to change.
Under the agreement hammered out in February , Netflix will gain direct access to Comcast's broadband network -- an arrangement that could become the model for the first of many to follow for the digital streaming company .
Acknowledging that there wasn't much of a flux in North American ISP index rankings in February, Netflix communications director Joris Evers touted in a blog post on Monday that the company expects to see "Comcast s performance improve in the rankings next month" as a result of the deal.
However, Evers refrained from offering a more specific forecast than that.
For reference, the Netflix ISP Speed Index covers the user experience for more than 44 million Netflix members worldwide  and counting. The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company asserted that its user base now streams over one billion hours of digital content on a monthly basis.
Evers also noted that Netflix extended its list of domestic ISPs to account for the top 60.

Comcast One Step Closer to Ensuring You Never Go to a Movie Theater Again
Announces new alliance with Sony.
Press release from Comcast just came across the transom:
Comcast today announced that it has signed an agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (SPHE) to sell the studio s titles through the Xfinity On Demand digital store. In the coming weeks, Xfinity TV customers will be able to purchase Sony Pictures movies and TV shows to own and access anytime, anywhere, on any device, often before the DVD release.
Comcast customers have the ability to purchase movies and television shows   often weeks before they are available to rent or purchase on Blu-ray and DVD   and store them seamlessly in the cloud. Their content can be enjoyed anywhere, anytime, on their TV, PC or mobile devices. Purchased titles are added to customers  On Demand menus which are easily accessible on the TV, online or via the Xfinity On Demand Purchases app.
The Comcast catalog now includes content from FOX, Lionsgate, NBCUniversal, Sony Pictures and Warner Bros.
How does Comcast intend to defeat the cord-cutters? By getting ahold of the good stuff first. If your buddy with the cable subscription can watch American Hustle weeks before you can, is that going to tempt you to give up on living a Netflix-only existence? Probably for some people it will.

Every month video streaming service Netflix trots out its results list for speed tests of US internet service providers, ranking each in descending order. There was a recent stir of controversy, as Comcast took a sudden nose-dive in the standings. This came, rather coincidentally, just before Netflix paid up for better service . In fairness, the deal was already in the works during the drop-off, so it was at best a negotiation tactic.
With that mess now in the rear-view mirror, Netflix announces it is expanding the list of ISPs that it plans to track and include on its monthly shame and fame list.
"We expanded the list to provide insight into the performance of many of the smaller providers in the US and to give credit where it is due. For example, Midcontinent, a regional cable provider in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, takes second place in the expanded rankings", says Joris Evers of Netflix.
The service also took the opportunity to tweak its new cable partner just a bit, stating "we do expect to see Comcast's performance improve in the rankings next month when we release March data".
The data is culled from more than 44 million Netflix customers worldwide, as the company also tracks ISPs in Mexico and The Netherlands, among other places. It's a bit of a wake-up-call for providers, as Neflix is calling out anyone who isn't living up to standards.

House Of Cards Coming To Comcast Xfinity Store Sans Netflix
By Adnan Farooqui on 03/10/2014 10:46 PDT
Not too long ago Netflix stepped into production of original content, and it scored a massive win with House of Cards . This Emmy winning series stars Kevin Spacey as a ruthless Congressman who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals, and the best thing about it is that Netflix releases all episodes of the season on one day, so fans can binge for as long as they want. Naturally, Netflix subscribers have to pay for the service, but now Comcast subscribers have another way out. Comcast Cable president and CEO revealed today that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store soon.
From the Xfinity Store, Comcast subscribers will be able to buy access to House of Cards without requiring Netflix. Initially only the first season will be available, and it hasn t been said when the second season, which came out last month, will be added. Orange is the New Black , another acclaimed Netflix original series, will also make its way to the Xfinity Store, albeit on May 13th.
Xfinity Store is quite similar to Netflix and Amazon Instant, launched last November, it lets Comcast subscribers stream movies and TV shows. Its not known right now how much both original series will cost on Xfinity Store.

Comcast users to get Netflix shows sans subscription
Comcast confirms that subscribers will now be able to purchase House of Cards in the Xfinity Store
Technology trends and news by Faith Merino

Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/358c
While Netflix has spent the last several years dutifully trying to convince content providers to license TV shows and movies to the subscription video-on-demand service all while simultaneously developing its own original content to draw in viewers HBO-style now it looks as though the tables have turned.
Comcast subscribers will soon be able to watch House of Cards via their cable set-top box sans Netflix subscription. That s according to a report from Variety , which notes that Comcast made a deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, thereby giving Comcast the rights to sell the series through its newly launched Xfinity Store.
While Netflix owns exclusive streaming rights to House of Cards, Sony is in charge of international and home distribution. 
Comcast also made a deal with Lionsgate that will give it rights to sell Netflix s other highly acclaimed original series Orange is the New Black in May.
Comcast has confirmed the report, but Netflix could not be reached for comment.
This doesn t mean that Comcast subscribers can stream Netflix free of additional costs. It s the digital equivalent of buying the DVD set when it hits the shelves months after the season airs. Non-Netflix users have been able to watch House of Cards since season one was released on DVD last June. It s also available in other digital stores, such as Amazon Instant Video, Walmart.com, and Verizon Fios.
A Comcast spokesperson says that House of Cards will be available in the Xfinity Store within the next 30 days, and that it will only be the first season of the show. The second season will presumably become available in the Xfinity Store some time around or after it s made available on DVD.
Previously, Netflix was in discussions with Comcast about the possibility of bringing a Netflix app to Comcast set-top boxes. Those discussions were reportedly put on hold (as were Netflix s talks with Time Warner about the same thing) when Comcast acquired Time Warner for $45 billion . Meanwhile, Comcast has reportedly been working on a video-on-demand service that could  out-Netflix Netflix. 
Last month, Netflix and Comcast announced a deal in which Netflix will pay for direct access to Comcast s subscribers . Net neutrality rules are meant to ensure that all digital content companies receive equal access to bandwidth. The problem is that Netflix is a notorious bandwidth hog, so Netflix s deal with Comcast is not actually paying for prioritization. Rather, Netflix is paying to deliver its content directly to consumers rather than going through middlemen, like Cogent Communications. Essentially, it s getting a direct route to Comcast Internet subscribers rather than driving on the same crowded freeway with all the other schmucks.

As expected, Netflix s deal with Comcast has produced a bump in speeds for the streaming video service.
In February, Netflix streaming speeds averaged 1.68 Mbps on Comcast, compared to 1.51 Mbps in February. It s not a huge leap, but it s the first sign of improvement after Netflix began paying Comcast for a direct connection late last month. Netflix said in a blog post that it expects Comcast to move up in the rankings starting next month.
Netflix has become noticeably slower on major Internet service providers, amid escalating disputes over how Netflix s huge amounts of traffic should be handled. In many cases, Netflix pays third-party transit providers to deliver traffic from their networks to ISPs such as Comcast. Typically, no money changes hands in these  peering  arrangements between transit providers and ISPs, but because Netflix is responsible for so much incoming traffic, ISPs feel they should be paid by Netflix s transit providers to add more capacity.
Under Netflix s deal with Comcast, Netflix servers sit in the same data centers that connect to Comcast s network, effectively cutting out the third-party transit provider. Although Netflix traffic doesn t get special treatment on the network, the direct connection should still result in better service. (Dan Rayburn at StreamingMedia.com has an detailed explanation of how this works . He also points out that Netflix isn t paying a new cost, but is simply paying a different provider, so the overall cost to Netflix may be negligible.)
Meanwhile, Netflix s average speeds continue to decline on Verizon FiOS, Verizon DSL and AT&T DSL, while AT&T U-Verse speeds improved slightly. Both AT&T and Verizon are also seeking payments from Netflix, as Ars Technica points out .
Comcast subscribers can now get the first season of House of Cards through their cable box.
Although Netflix and Comcast now appear to be living in harmony, that s not stopping Comcast from trying to give Netflix customers a way out. Under a deal with Sony Pictures, Comcast subscribers can soon buy the first season of the hit Netflix series House of Cards through their cable boxes. Another popular Netflix original, Orange is the New Black, will become available to Comcast subscribers in May, Variety reports .
Until now, Netflix has been the only place to watch House of Cards without purchasing the entire first season on DVD. But because Comcast s deal only covers season one, subscribers will still need a Netflix subscription to see how Frank Underwood s latest schemes play out. Update: Individual episodes of House of Cards are already available from other sources such as Amazon and iTunes.

Comcast Signs Sony EST Pact
MSO Customers Can Buy Movies,  House of Cards   Season One Via Set-top 3/10/2014  11:37 AM Eastern
By: Mike Farrell
Comcast Cable CEO Neil Smit said at a industry conference Monday that the cable giant has signed an electronic sell-through (EST) deal with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, a pact that will allow Comcast customers to purchase the first season of popular series  House of Cards  and early release movies via their set-top boxes.
Smit made the announcement at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom conference in Palm Beach, Fla. Monday. The Sony deal, which includes current movies like  American Hustle  (available March 11) and  Captain Philips,  complements existing EST agreements the cable giant has with LionsGate Entertainment (for movies and series like season one of  Orange is the New Black ), Twenty-First Century Fox, Warner Bros., and sister company NBC Universal. Comcast has said in the past it has had considerable success in electronic sell-through with movies like "Despicable Me 2," "Fast and Furious 6" and "The Hunger Games."
At the DB conference, Smit said the value of EST is in its currency   the movies are available after their release in theaters but "several weeks" before the traditional DVD window   and the convenience of ordering through their remote controls.
House of Cards has been available for sale through other outlets like Amazon.com, Walmart.com and Verizon FiOs. Now Comcast can add its name to the list.
  The Sony Pictures library is a terrific addition to our rapidly expanding offering of hit films and TV shows available for purchase,  said Comcast senior vice president of content acquisition Michael Schreiber in a statement.  The response to the digital store has been encouraging and tells us our customers love the flexibility and ease of purchasing content directly from Xfinity On Demand to watch when and where they want it. 
Smit said that Comcast continues to  assemble content rights, focusing on three areas: live linear programming, current seasons of shows and library content. He added that on the VOD side, Comcast disables the fast-forward function so content owners can get the full effect of C3 ratings for new shows and earlier episodes.
 But in return we want the full current season,  he said.  
Later, Smit said that Comcast continues to work with several MSOs regarding licensing of its X1 operating platform.

In the end, the naysayers who accused  HBO s  True Detective   of being sexist seem mostly irrelevant. Yes, it would be nice to see more top-notch hour-long dramas created by women and concerning women, particularly more women of color. But that s not what  True Detective  was intended to do.
At its heart, this was a story of male friendship, transcending macho rivalry and frat boy cavorting to ultimately be about guys saving each other.
A mystery wrapped in a religious cult conspiracy, slowly unfolded by two antiheroes   one a lying adulterer, the other an addict with pretentious theories about the meaning of life   ultimately was a male drama. The mission involved saving little girls, balancing the loss of one of the detective s little girl. But women didn t figure in, except as a plot twist to establish the two detectives  antipathy.
Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey deserve applause, the creepy littered overgrown and horrific compound where the endgame played out deserves a nod for set design; T Bone Burnett deserves praise for the moody, even otherworldly music. But storywise, the eight episodes of this anthology series involved too many leaps and loopholes. The misdirection concerning the suspected pedophile priest, the Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle, was just confusing. How did he die? What did it matter?

Much of the gumshoes  discovery happened by luck and chance rather than logic. Green ears? Green paint? A painter! The sudden rush of clues, leading neatly to the serial killer via work permits and job orders via computer, felt a bit pat after all the soul-searching, existential doubt and flashback interviewing.
The final scenes, with McConaughey dressed, positioned and coiffed to look like Jesus Christ, suggested more profundity than the show actually offered. Looking to the night sky for cosmic truths, Hart (Harrelson) and Cohle (McConaughey) again slip away from the authority figures (this time, it s the hospital) to go it alone. Together.
It s all about good versus evil, light versus dark, Cohle concluded, and  the light s winning. 
Moody, unnerving, confusing   but surprisingly optimistic.
HBO Go crash
Meanwhile, the light may have been ascendant, but the electrons weren t cooperating: The HBO Go streaming service collapsed, unable to feed demand for the finale Sunday. The network promptly scheduled a rerun, and the service on HBO cable was unaffected. The twitterverse had a field day (sample tweet:  Congratulations to #TrueDetective for being the first show to literally break @HBOGO ).

How 'True Detective' explains Iowa basketball
BY ZACH TILLY | MARCH 11, 2014 5:00 AM
The first season of HBO s pitch-dark serial-killer anthology  True Detective  tied up a few of its loose ends in its Sunday night finale, though its creator Nic Pizzolatto insisted from the start that the audience need not wait to see the mystery solved   all the necessary clues were coded into the show from the very first episode.
It s a strange way to begin a basketball commentary, yes, but here s my point: Had we employed the same Talmudic scholarship as fans devoted to  True Detective,  we might have been able to foretell the collapse of the Iowa basketball team before such a turn seemed possible.
Indeed, I d suggest that the details crucial to understanding Iowa s 1-5 finish were foreshadowed in its loss to Villanova in November.
Remember that at the time of the Battle 4 Atlantis title game, Villanova was seen as something of a disappointing consolation prize for an Iowa team that wanted a shot at Kansas. Yes, Villanova turned out to be great, but Iowa was done in, ultimately, by its own still-untreated pathologies.
Against  Nova, Iowa started hot   it led by 12 with 11-and-a-half minutes to go   but fell into what has become the hallmark of an Iowa second half, the colossal scoring drought. A 55-43 Iowa lead at the 11:10 mark was a 64-57 Villanova lead seven minutes later, after a 21-2 run in crunch time.
To extrapolate: Iowa led by 2 at Michigan State at halftime before being thoroughly dismantled by two separate 9-0 runs in the second half. The Hawkeyes led by 7 at Indiana with 15:54 left and promptly gave up a 9-0 run. They didn t score a single field goal between a Melsahn Basabe put-back at the 9:50 mark and a Mike Gesell jumper with 1:10 remaining, when the game was already out of hand.
At Minnesota, Iowa went from 13:42 to 8:04 without a field goal, a stretch during which Minnesota increased its lead from 2 points to 13.
Same story against Illinois. Fran McCaffery s crew led by 6 at 11:26, and by their next basket over five minutes later, they d given up an 11-0 run.
This particular symptom points to any number of causes: a lack of go-to scoring, the sloppiness that inevitably follows when Devyn Marble starts pressing in tight games. It s perhaps a lack of mental toughness or poor adjustments and poor lineup management, particularly from the under-12 media time-out to the under-8 stoppage, when Fran tends to turn to his second line. The persistence of these droughts indicates a complex set of deficiencies unlikely to be cracked in the next week.
That Villanova game also highlighted Iowa s inability to guard 3-point shooters in close games. The Wildcats  Ryan Arcidiacono hit two go-ahead 3s in the last minute to send the game to overtime and then assisted on two more 3s to give Villanova the early lead in overtime.
Bad luck, one might argue, but Iowa has been burned too many times for its inability to get late stops to be a coincidence.
Of course, there was Jon Ekey s game winner for Illinois on Sunday, but also Josh Gasser s crunch-time 3s in Wisconsin s win at Carver. On Jan. 28, Russell Byrd s improbable but undefended overtime dagger for Michigan State sent the Iowa fans home with their first of several devastating home losses.
In fairness, though, those defensive shortcomings aren t unique to crunch-time 3-point shooting. They were also run out of the gym by Minnesota s athletic guards and an Indiana team that had been, prior to Iowa s arrival, anemic.
We learned from the Villanova game a lot about Iowa s personnel use as well. Limited contributions in the Bahamas from Jarrod Uthoff, Peter Jok, and Anthony Clemmons   even before Josh Oglesby returned from his foot injury   forewarned that Iowa s highly touted 11-man depth was exaggerated. In reality, the Hawkeyes  depth proved to be mostly a Dackichian talking point   they ve looked absolutely gassed of late and the late-conference rotation has actually featured nine guys with an occasional sprinkling of Clemmons.
There were other clues, too   inconsistent frontcourt play, for example   but maybe, in the end, the mystery of the Hawkeyes will conclude with a revelation similar to that of  True Detective : the truth   that Iowa was but a slightly improved team with a tougher schedule, doomed to another 20-11 (9-9) finish   was right under our noses all along.

And just like that, Rust Cohle and Martin Hart have disappeared from the psychosphere of our television sets, with HBO airing the final episode of   True Detective   season one last night. And everyone was watching. In fact, so many people hit the network s HBO GO service that it crashed, leaving many fans looking at an endless load sign, as they took to the Internet to voice their fury . But by now, fans have caught up with the fate of Rust and Martin and their search for The Yellow King, and are left with that feeling of what to do next.
Well, we ve got a solution that will hopefully hold you over until details of the second season emerge all the music from  True Detective  season one. Unlike  Girls,  where music forms a part of the package that s being sold around the show, the tunes in  True Detective  have always been about texture. In fact, it s so deeply woven, we truly didn t realize at the time that we were hearing songs by Wu-Tang Clan or School Of Seven Bells or Father John Misty. Indeed, the choices have been part of a fabric that includes lots of blues, gospel and old timey country.

Last night, True Detective saw its season 1 finale, which was so popular that it crashed HBO Go. So what is next for the HBO series?
Nic Pizzolatto, True Detective creator, says that the success of season 1 has taught him a lesson.
"It's informed exactly one thing," he said in an interview with HitFix . "It's that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don't play the next one straight."

Season 2 has big shoes to fill. It's a good thing that Pizzolatto already knows what the next season will be about.
"I am still fleshing it out," he told Entertainment Weekly . "The basic idea: Hard women, bad men, and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system. I was well on my way in the writing but there's been a lot noise and work around the end of the first season that got in the way."
Season 1's religious themes and undertones might also make an appearance in the show's next season.
"I lived in the rural south in a heavily religious family but the only thing I can  point to there is this real sensitivity between knowing and wishing," Pizzolatto explained. "We live in a culture that has a real hard time distinguishing fiction from reality. Even when they're told something is fiction ... and it reflects one of [the] things that fascinates me about our species and our culture ... what we do with stories. I mean, look at people did with this story! It was a nice lesson learned for me. The show is not anti-religion or anti-anything. The show is against not thinking."
Unfortunately, Detective Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McConaughey, and Detective Marty Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, will not be returning. Michelle Monaghan is also not likely to return.
Season 2 will reportedly feature a new cast and storyline.
"We won't be back for season two," McConaughey said last week. "Season one was finite."
The story of Cohle and Hart could live on, however, as Pizzolatto has acquired the literary rights to the characters.
"So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out," Pizzolatto said. "Always a possibility."

For over fifteen years a conspiracy and myth has haunted Rust Cohle ( Matthew McConaughey ) and Martin Hart ( Woody Harrelson ), one involving a yellow king, a man with scars and the mysterious destination of Carcosa. An evil had spread its branches across Louisiana, something pervasive, powerful and for the longest time untouchable. The name of God was used as a cover for unspeakable crimes and killings, and Rust, Martin and anyone else who touched that darkness, found it touching them right back.  All my life I wanted to be nearer to God. The only nearness? Silence,  Joel Theriot (Shea Whigham) said in episode six,  Haunted Houses.  But in  Form And Void,  that silence has answers.
For much of the season, Rust has largely been presented as the visionary of the detective duo, going about his job with philosophical underpinnings to almost every aspect of an investigation. His interrogation technique is unparalleled, and even as Martin chased skirts and avoided the problems in his marriage, Rust followed up on every lead and kept digging. The widening gap between the pair tore them apart, however, watching Rust and Martin come back together has been one of the greatest satisfactions of the final act of the show.  I find it touching when Cohle asks about Marty s life that s something  95 Cohle would never do,  Nic Pizzolatto told Buzzfeed about a scene in episode seven,   After You ve Gone .   And indeed, Rust and Martin have never been more simpatico than they are here.
 The story was entirely planned around them reuniting to try and resolve this serial murderer case,  Pizzolatto also said, and there is something poetic about watching Rust and Martin working so well together here. In 2012, it s Martin s investigation techniques and intuition that lead the detectives from Steve Geraci s (Michael Harvey) revelations about the  chain of command  above him who hushed up the Marie Fonteneau case, to the home of Errol Childress aka The Man With Scars. He lives in squalor, speaks of  acension  and there is a sense he s long been prepared to make one final stand for his life s work of murder. And Rust knows they finally found his man, thanks to his synaesthesia.  That taste, aluminum, ash .I tasted it before ,  he intones with gravity before they get there. And it s a taste that nearly brings them to their demise.
Errol leads Rust into Carcosa, an underground warren of tunnels, twigs and branches, with Martin following his partner a bit of a distance behind. He s been busy trying to find a phone to call  Detective Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) to send backup. And after being taunted in the darkness, Rust comes face-to-face with Errol in a clearing, but he s first distracted by a hole revealing the night sky above, one that in his eyes becomes a swirling void. It s almost as if Rust has made peace with ending his life (remember, he once said,  My life s been a circle of violence and degradation, as long as I can remember. I m ready to tie it off ), and with Childress attacking him by surprise, that nearly happens. Rust is deeply wounded in the gut, before Martin arrives to help only to get critically wounded as well. And as Errol towers over Martin to finish him off, it s Rust who springs into action with what he has left, to shoot Errol in the head. In the distance the police arrives, a flare is sent up as beacon of hope to Rust and Martin (a beautiful visual moment) and it looks like case closed.
But this is where   True Detective   becomes so much more than just a procedural concerned with finding the killer (who was revealed anyway, in last week s  After You ve Gone ). When Detective Maynard Gilbough (Michael Potts) and Papania come to visit Martin in the hospital to share details of what their investigation has discovered about Childress, the Lake Charles murder and the web of people involved, he waves them off. Martin would prefer not to know. And as the audience hears via news reports, it looks like the Tuttle family will remain unscathed too. So what was this all about then, if not the killers? Mortality and meaning, perhaps, among other things.  It s just one story, the oldest,  Rust says about everything that s happened.  Light versus dark.  And Martin replies,   it appears to me, dark has a lot more territory. 
And it s a bit of a role reversal, and a fitting view for Martin who this long on the job, has seen the worst the world has to offer. But In 1995, it would ve likely been Rust to side with such a dark view of humanity, but something changed him. In a coma following surgery after getting stabbed by Errol Childress, Rust reveals to Martin that during that time, he not only felt the presence of his daughter, but her love too.  And then I woke up,  he says in tears. 
 Death is not the answer, rejoice  an elderly woman declared in last week s episode, and now Rust knows it himself.  If you ask me, light s winning,  he tells Martin before the credits roll. And it s a beautiful moment in a show that ends on a note of hope, instead of a neatly tied resolution. And it s stronger for it.  True Detective  has never put the mystery first, and it s something telling that the weakest episode of the season was also the most straightforward,  After You ve Gone.  Instead the show is about two men, one presented in darkness, who after losing his family, plunged headfirst into the darkest corners of his job, and the other a seemingly happy family man.
And the darkness of the case consumed them in different ways. Martin continually edged away from his family into bad habits, while Rust had an outlet for the sense of injustice he felt at God or the world or whoever was in charge of damning him to his fate of pain and loss. But the pair s trajectory found them trading places. What Martin saw on a continual basis of the force, caused him to drop the job. Whatever traditional notions about police work he might ve had were eradicated by the details of this case. For Martin, that s why the  dark has a lot more territory.  But for Rust, the mere fact that love can sustain as strongly as it does in his heart for his daughter, and having his own ideas turned around about the finality of death, gives him enough hope to start seeing the edges of light on the horizon.
It s a moving and soulful closer to  True Detective,  which has solidified itself as one of the best shows of the year. Nic Pizzolatto created a rich, intelligent, dangerous but beautifully textured world. Far more than just an eight episode procedural,  True Detective  is about what happens when horror comes to our doorstep, and the people we become after that encounter. [A]

True Detective  S01E08: "Form and Void"
Going into "Form and Void," there were a lot of ways to describe the first season of True Detective: stunning, raw, philosophical, frightening, pretentious, ambitious, boobies, occasionally hilarious, gorgeous, and incomplete. And coming out of the finale, nothing really changed about those adjectives. "Form and Void" was a very good but not great ending to one of the better new shows to come around in a long time, but I can't help but think the show peaked around Episode 5 the mind-bending and perfect "The Secret Life of All Fate" that threatened to be the first major step in a new post-Golden Age of television renaissance and since then has been merely a great detective show. That's probably not fair to True Detective to approach it in that manner, but I mean it when I say "great television show." True Detective was astounding television, even when it shifted away from what I thought was its strengths.
For me, it's impossible to look at "Form and Void" individually as an hour. True Detective was this idea of "event television" that other  networks are chasing. It was eight episodes of a new property that made  its viewers theorize and dive in headfirst into an empty pool of obsession. "Form and Void" was the end of a really long movie to me because Season 1 was self-contained with a beginning, middle, end, and no chance of more, unlike 22-or-even-13-episode seasons that contain filler and cliffhangers and could live on in syndication for your grandkids.
And because it was the end of the story rather than a regular season finale, I found it incredibly satisfying as an endpoint even if it wasn't the best part of the season. It ended about as perfectly as it could end. Hart and Cohle got their man in Erroll Childress, a man whose hygiene and sex life was just as frightening as his remorseless acts of murder, but they didn't bust up the bigger sex-cult child-pornography old man's club that was certainly connected to the Tuttle family and responsible for all these missing girls. True Detective was never a happy show, it focused on the worst of us in the worst of times. It's consistent with the show's theme that Hart and Cohle only put a Band-Aid on Louisiana's gusher of a declining young woman population, and realized they they "didn't get 'em all," and weren't going to get them all. But they did get the monster at the end of their nightmare, and the series portrayed this as a realistic victory.
For the viewer who demands closure, this probably didn't work. The idea that Billy Lee Tuttle is still out there and pulling up a van with no windows next to a schoolgirl right now is unsettling, but that's the point. True Detective wants you to leave Season 1 feeling that this battle between light and dark, good and evil, the Rust Cohles of the universe and the fat, incestuous Erolls of the universe isn't done because True Detective isn't afraid to show the harsh truth of the world. The paradox of the world needing bad men ("The world needs bad men," came straight from Rust's mouth early in the season) in order to have good men was all over True Detective, and watching those lines get reluctantly drawn is what really made the arcs of Hart and Cohle so interesting.
But it was the final minutes of "Form and Void" that saw those lines firmly etched into the ground. Our two men were still recovering from their battle wounds in the hospital when True Detective delivered an oddball of a twist ending that I don't think anyone expected. Rust Cohle went sentimental on us! Cohle's near-death experience had a profound effect on his psyche, and as Cohle sat in his wheelchair looking like he just got out of a meat grinder, he told Marty that he was looking at his night-sky metaphor (light vs. dark) all wrong. "Once there was only dark," he said, peering up at the faint stars. "If you ask me, the light's winning." Rust Cohle, the man who could look at a puppy and only see a trip to the vet to put the dog down in 12 years, had hope. HOPE! Cohle's words were captured on the season's final shot, a long hold on the night sky as stars shone brighter and brighter. It was almost enough to draw a tear. Almost.
I'm not entirely sure that ending worked, but I give True Detective an A-plus for effort and I loved how it broke expectations. When I think about how I will remember Rust Cohle, one of television's best characters of all time, it will be the man who amassed a beer-can-man army as his minions against his interrogators. It will be the man who spoke of flat circles, bad men, and suicide suggestions. His final revelation of hope will be a footnote in my memory even though it shouldn't be, and I'm not sure if it's because I'm enamored with the Rust Cohle of old (1995 and 2002, specifically) or if it's because I want True Detective to be that dark, Nihilistic show that thrilled me through the first five or six episodes. And maybe it's because I'm not entirely sure I even believe him. It could be the pain meds talking for all I know. It's just an abrupt turn to take everything we knew about a man Rust was defined by that fatalistic attitude and spin it on its head in a series' final minute. But gosh darnit, it still warmed my heart even if it was sudden and cheesy. I like to think Cohle took that positive attitude straight to the nearest watering hole and put down a celebratory six pack of Lone Star.
The ending may give us a little insight as to what's coming in future seasons. I'm just guessing here, but what if future seasons of True Detective all existed in the same universe, and really, there's no reason they couldn't, and told similar stories of how the job affected people in different ways? Did you ever read Cloud Atlas (ignore the movie, it's awful)? It's one of my favorite books, and I think True Detective could do something similar with its structure as it moves forward. Cloud Atlas takes place over several different time periods with recurring themes and images popping up in several short stories. It would make sense that Season 1 of True Detective, which focused more on existential themes rather than homicide investigations, would carry over similar ideas into Season 2's brand-new setting and characters. Cohle's last-minute ray of sunshine could just be the beginning of this war between light and dark. I'm not saying that every season will end with a formerly disenchanted detective saying, "If you ask me, the light's winning," but I could easily imagine it ending with another small victory. "We ain't gonna get them all, that ain't what kind of world it is, but we got ours," Marty said. Maybe True Detective really is a show about good prevailing over evil, about believing that the world isn't one huge garbage dump rotting away at the core, about understanding that you can only do your part to help the light. Maybe, when True Detective Season 14 ends and Zac Efron shares a sunrise with Ashton Kutcher, we'll see True Detective for what it really was: a show about changing your outlook for the better. That's the only way I can understand Cohle's sudden reversal of perspective fitting in with the rest of the series. (That, or another main character has the exact opposite trajectory as Cohle's and the two meet in a later season as a superhero and supervillain and we realize Season 1 was just preamble to a Captain Cohle summer blockbuster movie franchise.)
But I still call "Form and Void" "good but not great" because it didn't quite match up with the meaty and mysterious middle of Season 1, which I thought (and prayed) True Detective would take all the way to the end. Episodes 3, 4, and 5 were revelatory television that played with narrative structure, time, and character. Earlier in Season 1 I tweeted out that True Detective had consumed me, but once the interrogations with Gilbough and Papania ended, True Detective burped me up. I loved the idea of not knowing what was the truth, on relying on potentially unreliable narrators, of fitting the puzzle pieces together to figure out what had happened and what made Hart and Cohle who they were in the present. Episodes 7 and 8 shed that mystery so that all we saw was truth. I hate to penalize a show for being so great at one point, but that run of True Detective episodes were SO good that it made the last three hours look somewhat tame by comparison.
And tame is indeed a relative term, for "Form and Void" contained the scariest sequence of the series by far. Cohle's frantic gangland exit at the end of "Who Goes There" remains the season's pi ce de r sistance, but Cohle and Hart navigating Childress' twig maze was more intense given the uncertainty of it all. And that's what these last two episodes did have over the first six. We didn't know if Hart or Cohle would die because we were in real time. Even as soon as Hart and Cohle pulled up to Childress' hoarder house, the air in the room changed. There's a shot of the car facing us with that little shed in the background, and you just knew something horrible was going on in there. Cohle knew it, too, and immediately told Hart to call Papania for backup because "this is the place." True Detective does so many things so well, but my favorite is it's mastery of suspense and the way it can seamlessly transition into action. "Marty clear the house!" was our starter-gun for a 10-minute sequence of heart-racing in this one, and it was impossible to do anything but inch forward on the couch and be mesmerized by the backwoods labyrinth, the effective use and non-use of sound, and gorgeous cinematography. 
I've probably changed my mind on "Form and Void" a dozen times since watching it, wavering between various degrees of positivity, but I'm noticing that the more I think about it, the more I like it. Right now, it's very, very good, but tomorrow it could be three "very"s and by the time Season 2 ends, it could be the best ever as it finds another puzzle piece to snap into.
CASE NOTES
  Sorry for the delay on this! No screener plus a newborn baby means my schedule is all over the place.
  This show, more than any I've ever seen, was in grave danger of being ruined by the Internet (and some could easily argue that it was). I never understood why it was picked apart as ravenously as it was with viewers looking for clues to the case and theorizing twists and even a supernatural component. To me, it had always been a more straightforward show that understood that creating bad people who could live within the realm of our known universe was much scarier than anything supernatural.
  However, I do understand disappointment from those who needed every question answered. Online speculation created most of those questions though. I never cared about Marty's daughter's figurines or the picture of the Five Horsemen or even Carcosa and the idea of The Yellow King, but the Internet sure did. I think I saved myself a lot of frustration by not getting sucked into the conspiracy hunt and instead watching True Detective for the characters more than the case.
  And because True Detective was the focus of so much  watercooler discussion, it felt like "Form and Void" almost hit a point  of self parody at some moments, where I got sucked into over-adrenalized  file sorting or digging into tax records, or watched just waiting for  Cohle to say something weird instead of letting these characters be  themselves. LIke Marty's "What's scented meat?" punchline, which made me  think more of a buddy cop comedy than anything else.
  The big break in the case being a house that was painted green decades ago and Marty figuring out that the Spaghetti Monster's green ears were linked to it was pretty lame! Sorry, but it was! But an interesting investigation was never one of True Detective's strong points.
  Cohle might have the new outlook on life, but I worry for Marty. He's a broken man who has nothing left to do but go back to microwave TV dinners. However, he seemed pretty happy to be sucking on that sippy cup in the hospital.
  Speaking of that scene, that back and forth between Hart and Cohle was fantastic. Hart: "What's your problem?" Cohle, barely alive: "Nothing, what's your problem." Hart: "Don't ever change, man." *flips the bird* And Cohle responded in kind.
  I love the sequences of stitching together the gorgeous landscape shots to show how the land was all connected and spotted with sites of evil. Erroll's home, the bayou, the Ledoux meth compound, the river, the site of Dora Lange's murder. It all resonated as a complete landscape and nifty reminder of where we've been. And, if you're pessimistic, what might still be out there. 
  I don't normally do this, but a hearty thank you to all those involved in the series for making it such a fantastic watch. This was top-notch entertainment and an extraordinary effort from very talented people. 
  "Making flowers"? Did you perverts ever think that maybe they were referring to putting together some great bouquets?

For me, True Detective ticked boxes that no other television show could. The Wire was the closest show that came close to bringing the same amount of depth, and that was a different kind of depth.

Lots of anger was expressed for the ending, but also large praise; from what I've seen, you either loved it or hated it. It's difficult for a show to steal the crown of your favorite show, but I have a hunch that HBO's latest converted many.
If True Detective did become your new favorite television show, why?

Editor s note: Alyssa Rosenberg is PostOpinions s new culture blogger. Her own blog will be launching in the coming days. This post discusses the season finale of  True Detective  in extensive detail.
As the final episode of the first season of HBO s hit anthology series  True Detective  approached this Sunday, the show s obsessive audience puzzled over what might happen when former detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle ( Matthew McConaughey ) caught up to the serial killer they d been chasing across Louisiana for almost two decades. Would Marty, the genial Louisiana native,  turn out to be the killer , hiding his brilliant scheme by playing the dummy to his more philosophically inclined partner? Would Marty and Rust finally learn that the secret they d repeatedly missed had been obvious all along to  the women they routinely abuse and ignore ? Or, in keeping with the show s many references to the Carcosa mythos, a concept shared among horror and fantasy writers for more than a century,  would monsters from another world appear on the shores of the Louisiana bayou ?
In an interview before the series finale, series creator Nic Pizzolatto suggested something even weightier than an interlocking literary game. Explaining the stakes that Rust and Marty were facing as they reached the end stage of their quest,  Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed s Kate Aurthur :  I think given the amorphous nature of the evil they re pursuing, its historical roots in culture and government, they would have to be willing to die to fully pursue their absolute justice. 
Sussing out the  historical roots in culture and government  of sex crimes and the biases that let them go unprosecuted is a fascinating goal for any show to set itself. And it would have been a particularly strong mission statement for  True Detective.  The show was shot in Louisiana, and in its early episodes it showed some real signs of interest in what happens to the working poor when they become disabled by accidents or exposed to the compounds produced in the region s chemical refineries. And Pizzolatto has described this season of  True Detective    any that follow would have different characters and a different case   as  a close, two-person point-of-view show.  That s an interesting opportunity to explore how two white, middle-class men might have been hobbled by their perspectives into blaming poor men for rich men s crimes and coverups. A confrontation between two such men, the forces they re aligned against and their own views of the world would be a fraught and original encounter.
But the finale of  True Detective  didn t do any of that. Instead, we got a predictable crime story that even the show s most ardent defenders are going to be hard-put to argue is a clever examination of the genre, or of political power in Louisiana. The real killer of Dora Lange (Amanda Rose Batz), the first victim Rust and Marty investigated, turns out to be Errol Childress (Glenn Fleshler), the son of former sheriff Ted Childress. That relationship might have been enough to protect Errol, but he had other connections. Ted Childress was the unacknowledged son of Sam Tuttle, a powerful Louisiana patriarch. As a result, the Childresses were related to Billy Lee Tuttle (Jay O. Sanders), Sam Tuttle s son and a powerful minister who tried to interfere with Rust and Marty s initial investigation into the serial killings in 1995. And Ted s cousin was  Eddie Tuttle, who served first as Louisiana governor and then as senator.
That s a rich web of power and family to explore, but  True Detective  leaves most of its revelations for the last hour of the show, leaving little time to meditate on specific relationships or Louisiana politics. Sheriff Childress covered up for Errol during the 1995 case, altering a missing persons case file to say that the report was made  in error.  His deputy sheriff, Steve Geraci, admits this all to Rust and Marty in the final episode, excusing his lack of curiosity about the change by telling the two men,  There s a chain of command. No reason to change it. I just follow what the big man says. It s how this all works. 
That s awfully anemic writing on a theme that s familiar to anyone with a bedtime late enough to let them stay up for  True Detective.  And Geraci s speech gives us no particular insight into what it might mean to be the  big man  Childress apparently was in the specific time and place that was Louisiana in 1995. We certainly don t get any insight into why Rust and Marty weren t curious at the time that Billy Lee Tuttle wanted to gain control of their case by assigning it to a task force. Rust may end up castigating himself for not having identified Errol as the killer earlier. But he and Marty were, in their own ways, just as willing to look away from the Tuttles and Childress as Geraci, a man they threaten for his cowardice and blindness.
Rust and Marty don t show any more curiosity about a woman (the spectacular and underused Ann Dowd) they find with Errol, who appears to have some sort of intellectual disability   and neither does  True Detective.  As the police swam in to the Childress family estate, she sits, terrified, among the wreckage of Errol s mad fantasies, utterly alone. Detective Thomas Papania (Tory Kittles) later tells Marty that she was  at least a half sister  to Errol, substituting a lazy stereotype about Southern incest for any insight into how she, and Errol s dead victims, could go so utterly missing, or have been so invisible in the first place.
Marty and Rust may have unhealthy relationships with women. But  True Detective  doesn t actually show any more interest in the vanished women than they did. The show took time to demonstrate that the stories Rust and Marty told other detectives were lies, and even to linger as Marty narrated his way through a public records database. But it couldn t make space in its eight episodes to give these women s lives more purpose than as catalysts for Rust and Marty s redemptions. Dora Lange emerges only in stories her ex tells about her. Prostitutes, domestic workers and chemical plant employees offer links in an investigative chain and are never heard from again.
Even Marty s much put-upon ex-wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) and estranged daughters ultimately showed up in the hospital to provide Marty with a tangible reward for his follow-through. Given that  True Detective  has strongly implied from its earliest episodes that Marty s older daughter Audrey (Madison Wolfe) might have been a victim of abuse, or at least a witness to it, this disinterest in her inner life or the truth of what happened to her is particularly off-putting. In the world of  True Detective,  a man can do pretty much anything short of turning a woman into a paraphilic love map or trapping her in a house of horrors, and still deserve tender ministrations. And even as  True Detective  reacts in disgust to men who treat women as disposable, it also acts the same way toward Audrey, and to anyone who might have lived to receive the justice Dora Lange was denied.
After Errol s been killed and the case has gone national, we see a credulous news anchor telling her audience that reporting  discredited rumors that the accused was, in any way, related to Louisiana Senator Edmund Tuttle.  The Tuttles don t even have to be tainted by association with a crooked branch in their family tree, much less take responsibility for any complicity they might have had in Errol s crimes. Rust is discouraged, because he and Marty both know from a horrifying videotape that Errol wasn t the only person involved in the ritual abuse of young women he was just the last surviving member of his horrifying little community. But Marty bucks him up by insisting that he and Rust did their share and shouldn t fret over the justice that s eluded them.  We ain t never gonna get  em all. That ain t what kind of world it is,  Marty says.  But we got ours. 
That, apparently, is supposed to be enough to satisfy us.  Once there was only dark,  Rust tells Marty as the two men look up at the stars.  If you ask me, the light s winning.  But telling us that the powerful will get off, and that there s nothing to learn about why it happens so why bother, is a view of politics even blacker and more tangled than the Lair of Crazy Errol built in an old French fort. The Rusts and Martys of that world end up recovering in the hospital with the luxury to reach those cynical conclusions. The Dora Langes of it end up dead.

 True Detective  Creator Nic Pizzolatto Teases Saga Of Rust & Martin Could Continue In Books
'True Detective' Creator Nic Pizzolatto Teases Saga Of Rust & Martin Could Continue In Books

So, is that all for Rust Cohle and Martin Hart? Star-gazing and pondering the eternal battle of light versus dark? Certainly, their story won t continue on the acclaimed HBO series, as it came to a close last night ( read our recap here ), with the second season focusing on a whole new set of characters and a case that hints at a grander storyline ( read those details here ). But there is some hope for those expecting more about Rust and Marty.
Chatting with EW , Pizzolatto confirmed he retains the literary rights to the characters, and teases that he may not be through with them just yet.   maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility,  he shared.
Yes, Pizzolatto is a novelist, and broke out with the noir-ish  Galveston  ( now being made into a film starring  Matthias Schoenaerts ), but it also seems like making  Rust & Marty: The Novel  isn t at the top of his to-do pile. That said, the possibilities of new stories with the pair is potentially interesting, considering there are plenty of lost years in   True Detective   timeline to dive into. That said, there is something pleasing about the finality of this story and these characters across eight episodes.

"Who was the Yellow King?" and all your other True Detective questions, answered.
Photo still from True Detective   2014 Home Box Office
As Rust Cohle warned us at the end of Episode 3 of True Detective,   This is a world where nothing is solved .  At the end of the first season, the show didn t so much explain all the answers as gesture toward them, leaving us to fill in the blanks (or, perhaps, plot holes). Below, we take our best crack at answering the finale s big questions.
What movie was Errol watching at the beginning of the finale? And what was with all the creepy accents?
Errol is watching North by Northwest . True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto explained his thinking behind this scene in an interview with Alan Sepinwall :
There was this idea that when he talks in his real voice, it s very slurred because of the scarring. My background for him was that he learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies.

How were the Tuttles involved?
It remains unclear whether the Tuttles were directly involved in Errol s crimes or whether they just helped cover them up. Toward the end of the finale, a newscaster says that rumors of a suggested family tie between the senator and Errol Childress had been denied. But we know better: They re closely related, and the reverend, at least, was in deep. It seems likely that his powerful cousin was a part of the conspiracy, too, if not a participant in the crimes.
The reverend s father and the senator s uncle, Sam Tuttle, was Errol s grandfather. He raped both Errol and Errol s sister, and he was open enough about his sexual appetites that his housekeeper, at least whom we met in Episode 7 was well aware of them. Reverend Tuttle knew more: He kept a videotape of Marie Fontenot s rape (and perhaps her murder), which occurred in the place Errol called Carcosa, in his safe. What s more, Reverend Tuttle helped cover up the sexual abuse that took place at one of his Wellspring schools, in part by dismissing a deacon and claiming that it was due to charges of embezzlement. Did he orchestrate the abuse as well? True Detective doesn t say.
How did Papania find Rust and Marty in order to save them?
Presumably Marty is eventually able to find a working phone in the house to call him, though the episode doesn t show this happen.
Why does Rust say,  L chaim, fat ass ? Isn't that kind of a random thing for a nihilist Texan to say?
The short answer is the Rule of Cool . (If something s awesome enough, you don t need to explain it.) The slightly longer answer is that the quote seems to be a reference to Daredevil comics. Here s the panel in which Marvel superhero uses the line as a kiss-off to his archrival .

Who was the Yellow King?

(Costume designer Jenny Eagan confirmed this in our interview .)
At Carcosa, how was Errol able to make his voice appear to be everywhere at once?
Since Pizzolatto has said that   there is nothing supernatural   about the crimes in True Detective, it seems safe to assume that this, like Cohle s final swirling cosmic vision, is a hallucination. (Either that, or Errol s  Carcosa  has really crazy acoustics.)
Is there really a fort like that in Louisiana?
Yes. The Carcosa scenes were filmed on location at Fort Macomb , which was built in 1822.

Why did Errol draw so much attention to Dora Lange even lighting the fire that drew the police to her body?
Advertisement
Pizzolatto offered his explanation in an interview with Entertainment Weekly :
You can tell there are certain times he wants people to notice him. Childress was signaling to the authorities both his presence and the presence of the men who made him.
What does Errol mean when he says,  My ascension removes me the disc in the loop? 
Errol s mythology perhaps can t be reasonably explained the simplest answer seems to be simply  he s crazy  but Pizzolatto offered his own explanation to Entertainment Weekly:
In the beginning, when he says,  My ascension removes me the disc in the loop,  he s describing the cosmology of eternal recurrence of various characters, including Cohle and Reggie Ledoux hit upon, and he s hitting upon his personal mythology. When he says,  It s been weeks since I left my mark, would they have eyes to see,  we can tell from that that he s angling for a reckoning, for a showdown. He s waiting for it. He believes the murders ritually enacted over a period of time, upon his death, permit him an ascension that removes him from the Karmic wheel of rebirth.

Why is the finale called  Form and Void ?
It s a reference to Genesis 1:2 :
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
This also ties back to Rust s closing speech. Rust reminds Marty,  Once there was only dark. You ask me, the light s winning.  It isn t until the following verse that God says,   Let there be light . 
What was up with the flower motif?
It may have been just a coincidence. In our interview with True Detective costume designer Jenny Eagan, we asked her if there was any hidden meaning to all the flowers featured in the costumes. She told us,   No, not really . 
Do painters really get paint on their ears?
Advertisement
We put this question to Alan of the All Los Angeles Painting Company :
Sometimes? Not normally. You might get a few drops on them. Unless you re a member of the Three Stooges, or something. When you re an experienced painter, no, it s very rare. Unlesssss never mind, no. No, any level of experience, and it wouldn t happen, unless you were spraying all over and you weren t wearing a mask. And then you would have paint everywhere, not just on your ears.
What do we know about Season 2?
Not much. From that same Alan Sepinwall interview with Pizzolatto :
This is really early, but I ll tell you (it s about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.

RATINGS ARE A FLAT CIRCLE NEWS
... HBO's True Detective looked into the stars last night during its season finale ( which I reviewed! ) and what looked back was a ton of eyeballs: 3.5 million people tuned in for the first airing, a very good number for a first-season show on HBO. By comparison, just over 3 million tuned in for the Season 1 finale of Game of Thrones, which is now HBO's biggest series. And the 11 million gross average viewers for True Detective's first season makes it the most-watched freshman series for HBO since the 2001 premiere of Six Feet Under. It's unclear how many of those viewers are paid subscribers, though. HBO GO, HBO's on-demand streaming service, broke under the weight of people trying to watch True Detective's finale, and many of those are believed to have been sharing passwords. Thanks for ruining it for the rest of us, you leeches! [ Variety ]

... The ratings were considerably more down-to-earth for Fox's out-of-this-world Cosmos. The remake of Carl Sagan's scientific saga was broadcast across 10 networks, including Fox, FX, FXX, and National Geographic, but still only managed to bring in 8.5 million viewers. One Fox projection had the company expecting northward of 40 million viewers. Doing a little quick math in my head, I can say that is a massive disappointment. That's what you get for for airing educational programming, Fox! More bikinis and explosions, please! [THR ]
... ABC's new sorta-zombie drama Resurrection fared much better, notching the best-rated midseason drama debut on network television in two years. An impressive 13.3 million viewers tuned in on a busy Sunday evening, which was good for a 3.6 rating in the 18-49 demo. But is the show any good? Glad you asked, because I reviewed it . [ The Wrap ]
... Cartoon Network just ordered a bazillion shows, so let's get through 'em as fast as we can! Over the Garden Wall is an animated miniseries about two brothers trapped in a mysterious land. Clarence follows an optimistic boy who wants to do everything and will debut on April 14. We Bare Bears centers on a trio of bears who are trying to assimilate into human society. There's also a slew of licensed shows, including a new Tom and Jerry, an updated Scooby-Doo! series called Be Cool Scooby-Doo!, Bugs Bunny in Wabbit, the Lego-branded series Ninjago, and Sonic the Hedgehog in the computer-animated Sonic Boom. Rounding out the roster are Total Drama: Pahkitew Island, Numb Chucks, and BeyRaiderz. [ Deadline Hollywood ]

CASTING NEWS
... Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas) will star in Battle Creek, CBS's upcoming detective pilot from Breaking Bad's Vince Gilligan. He'll play one half of a pair of buddy cops assigned to keep the town of Battle Creek, Michigan crime-free, despite a lack of help from government resources. Dean Winters (Oz) plays his buddy. [ TV Line ]
... Gabourey Sidibe (American Horror Story: Coven) will recur on Fox's hip-hop drama Empire.

Now we know.
The finale of  Breaking Bad  remains utterly unchallenged as the perfect finale for one of the great series in what is now routinely agreed to be a new 21st century  Golden Age  in television history.
Sunday s HBO finale of  True Detective  didn t even come close. It was certainly suspenseful and creepy enough as detectives Rust Cohle and Marty Hart traced serial killer Errol Childress through his overgrown (and underexplained) rural temple of slaughter  Carcosa.  And Matthew McConaughey had a final breakdown scene worthy of an Oscar winner as he told his partner, played by Woody Harrelson, about seeing his dead daughter on  the other side. 
But by the standards of the previous seven episodes, the finale of  True Detective  was nothing but a workmanlike wrap-up   just a few important steps up from hackwork.
However bizarre was the sudden adoption of a British accent by the actor who played the killer (Glenn Fleshler), he was nothing more than a standard slasher movie boogie man at the end   Michael Myers in a  Halloween  movie or Jason in a  Friday the 13th  movie, able to lift victims off the ground with one hand. Completely unexplored at the end was the cult of voodoo child murderers often referred to but, at the crucial moment, pitched into the wastebasket as being of no special plot interest.
Sorry, but to me, that s a grotesque dereliction of moral duty. If a TV show is going to sacrifice children as a plot point, it owes its audience some elucidation of such evil. You don t just fling it into the mix on the fly and get back to the business of creeping people out with a skulking chase through a vine-strewn rural labyrinth.
Predictably, of course, some disagreed, if you scoured the Web the first thing Monday morning. Andrew Romano in the Daily Beast called the finale  the perfect conclusion to a series that has come as close to perfect over the course of its eight all-too-brief episodes as any I can remember.   To tie things up in any other way would have betrayed what the first season was all about. 
I beg to differ. And I m far from alone. New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum tweeted that it was disappointing. Killer Errol Childress, said Kevin P. Sullivan on the MTV website, was  nothing more than a lunatic capable of unspeakable evils  but maintained that he  never had to be more than that.  On any other show than  True Detective  I might have agreed.
It would, to be sure, be true in a slasher movie, but in a television show of such dark existential eloquence, it s almost offensive.
I agree with all those who say that  True Detective  wasn t really about a serial killer at all but about the relationship of two Louisiana state cops whose polarized selves manage to come together as a pair of men mutually haunted by ineradicable evil.
In the end, it wasn t Cohle, that great poet of nocturnal triumph, who looked up into the night sky and said there s a lot more blackness up there than light, it was Marty, the hypocritical family man. The show s last line was Cohle saying in response that while once there was only dark,  you ask me, light s winning. 
Which, frankly, I find a vastly less eloquent   and poetic   variation on a bit of throwaway metaphysics once offered to an interviewer by Thelonious Monk:  it s always dark; otherwise, we wouldn t need the sun. 
In the post-finale discussion of the show on the Atlantic Monthly website, writer Amy Sullivan admitted she couldn t even understand Cohle s last line at first hearing.
I couldn t either. I needed help from other ears.
In that same discussion, Christopher Orr confided an unfulfilled  prefinale predication that I was making, too   that one of the two men, most likely Cohle, would die before the end.
That, it seems to me, was the perfectly logical ending to a cable TV show able to immerse its viewers in a singular darkness. To have Rust prove, at the end, to be virtually  unkillable  even by the Boogie Man, is simply knee-jerk professional scriptwriting that betrayed the human fallibility show explored so brilliantly.
On a vastly lesser scale was one of the more promising buddy TV series on a conventional network   ABC s  Mind Games,  whose pairing of Christian Slater and Steve Zahn was compelling on a much lower level than that of McConaughey and Harrelson but was still hugely interesting on its own.
I can t tell you how much I wanted to like  Mind Games.  I m happy to see Slater and Zahn in almost anything. But  Mind Games  turned into a thoughtless weekly combination of a couple of TV s newest antiheroic cliches   the mentally disturbed prodigy (first seen in  House  and  Monk ) and the post- Mad Men  firm specializing in manipulating people into doing what they don t want to do ( House of Lies,   The Crazy Ones ).
Put them together and Zahn s overacting as Slater s bipolar brother was one of the more insensitive portrayals of mental illness in recent memory. In addition, there is little, if anything, fundamentally appealing  about the manipulation-for-hire task the two brothers have put themselves in business for.
However sympathetic their clients might be on the show, the brothers  deceits in their cause just aren t.
A disappointment to be sure.
Which makes  Mind Games  a minor network TV series but a major waste of two rather wonderful actors.

The season finale of the Nic Pizzolatto-created anthology series averaged 3.5 million viewers, up 50 percent from the premiere.
More than 3 million people were curious to find out who the killer was on " True Detective ". The first season finale of the anthology crime drama series drew an average of 3.5 million viewers, up over 50% from the premiere which posted 2.3 million viewers. Across three telecasts on Sunday, March 9, the episode lured a total of 4.9 million viewers.
According to HBO, the show averaged 11 million total viewers over the season across all airings plus DVR and On Demand. It marks the most-watched freshman for the premium cable channel series since "Six Feet Under" premiere in 2001 (11.4 million).
Due to high demand for the season finale, HBO GO crashed for a few hours. On Monday morning, HBO released a statement to explain the problem, "Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of True Detective, HBO GO was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9:00 PM ET last night. The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal."
In the season finale, Matthew McConaughey 's Rust and Woody Harrelson 's Hart caught the killer and they both survived after a showdown with the bad guy, Errol. Asked why he gave a happy ending for the show, series creator Nic Pizzolatto explained to Entertainment Weekly, "A few reasons. We're never going to spend time with these guys again. And killing characters on television has become an easy short cut to cathartic emotion."
He went on elaborating, "So I thought killing the guys, or having something more mysterious happen to them ... would have been the same thing if the show had gone full-bore into the supernatural... To me, the challenge was to not only let these guys live, but show true character change through this journey. That passing through the eye of the needle in the heart of darkness has actually done something to them."
"The challenge was to create an emotionally resonant ending that made the journey worthwhile," he continued. "And it felt to me like my proper relationship to the characters should end with me allowing them to walk away into some kind of immortal life outside of this show... We don't know what kind of life they'll have. But I think we can be sure that each man is more willing to acknowledge the presence of grace... They are not healed, but now, for the first time, you can imagine a future where they are healed. And before that was never a possibility for Cohle and hardly a possibility for Hart. But now it's a real earned possibility."
To HitFix, Pizzolatto said, "This is a story that began with its ending in mind, that Cohle would be articulating, without sentimentality or illusion, an actual kind of optimism. That line, you ask me, the light's winning, that was one of the key pieces of dialogue that existed at the very beginning of the series' conception."
HBO has not officially announced a second season for the anthology series, but Pizzolatto has begun working on the story. "I am still fleshing it out," he shared. "The basic idea: Hard women, bad men, and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system. I was well on my way in the writing but there's been a lot noise and work around the end of the first season that got in the way."

It is hard to recall the last time a television series has gripped the cultural consciousness so quickly, spawning memes, a sprawling amount of Internet speculation and commentary, as well as divisive conversations about gender roles on television (check out Emily Nussbaum s harsh, but terrific piece in The New Yorker for more on that) as much as True Detective  has. At that rate, a season finale that was anything less than the finest 60 minutes of television would be doomed to succeed. Alas, the last of eight episodes from Nic Pizzolatto s first anthology is a solid, but not quite shattering hour of television. Nevertheless, it is filled with the key elements that any True Detective viewer would hope for: strong acting, haunting music and art direction, sublime camerawork, unbearable suspense and a smattering of dark humour.
Since its start, True Detective has done so much to thwart our expectations of what a crime series can be that the rather conventional ending is bound to disappoint just about everybody. But, even if the episode does not fulfill the lofty hopes of its fans, I cannot imagine any Killing-like rage directed at HBO for failing to tie up some loose ends. One must remember that these eight episodes have always been more about uncovering the truth behind Hart and Cohle, rather than the suspect of Dora Lange s murder. As a conclusion to suit the show s character-driven nature, it was deeply satisfying.
The foreboding figure at the end of episode seven is Errol William Childress. He has burns in his back, scars on his face and a beer belly. He lives in a shackled home in the middle of the lurid Louisiana wasteland with his bedraggled aunt/lover (played by Ann Dowd) and his dead father. Glenn Fleshler, who plays Errol, is tense and terrific, able to show menace and vulnerability in a single glance during a scene when he peeps on some children at play during recess.
The first anti-climax that True Detective reaches in this hour is the brisk amount of time it takes Hart and Cohle to realize his identity. In a colourful drawing shown of Childress last week, the  spaghetti monster  had green ears. Well, in one of the case files connected to the Dora Lange case, one of the homes that was investigated was freshly painted green. One quick interview and a couple of web searches later, our detectives have an address. It may have been more gratifying for the duo to figure out his identity through a more labyrinthine process, but at least give Pizzolatto credit for, somewhat unpredictably, making Hart the one who connects the dots together.
However, as flat and formulaic as some of this procedural becomes, it all leads up to another tour de force sequence directed by the great Cary Joji Fukunaga that is almost as remarkable as that tracking shot from episode four. (Fans of the show should check out Fukunaga s breathtaking debut feature, Sin Nombre, if they haven t already.) Few sequences in small-screen memory have such a visceral atmosphere. We can almost feel the chill of the graveyard-like entrance, as barren, dry trees loom over the road. We can smell the foul stench that Marty breathes in as he moves deeper into Childress s home.

While we still won t divulge too much,  True Detective  creator Nic Pizzolato is willing to divulge a couple of things about where the show is headed   as it enters its second season.
Though the next batch of episodes will fix on new characters and likely feature a new cast (with Matthew McConaughey confirming at last week s Academy Awards that he and Woody Harrelson aren t involved in the next season), some of the more popular themes of the first season will make a reprise.
Shortly after Sunday s broadcast premiere of the season one finale- whatcha think, y all? did you guess as much? did it leave you   excuse the pun   scarred?   Pizzolato told HitFix a few what s and where s relating to the next season of the HBO drama.
 This is really early, but I ll tell you [it s about] hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system. 
And assumingly, there ll be a case needing solving involving the hard lasses, evil blokes and occult history of the transportation system. That doesn t necessarily mean it ll be another murder mystery, though; Pizzolta has stated before that the title  True Detective  can lend itself to anything- I guess anything that s puzzle has a piece that needs relocating and fixing back into place.
One element of the first season that Pizzolta said will likely be brought back for the second season are some of those kookier, almost supernatural-hinting moments from the first season. It s those  Twin Peaks -like moments that audiences seemed to go for, he says.
 [The reaction to season one] has informed exactly one thing. It s that I realize I need to keep being strange. Don t play the next one straight. 
While HBO hasn t officially announced a season, the fact that the  True Detective  finale  broke  HBO GO this weekend   because of the amount of requests coming in from those wanting to stream it   suggests it s definitely on their roster for 2015. One suspects they re going to wait until they ve got their  big names  for the second season, before announcing the new season.
(on a side note : Pizzolato has retained the rights to Harrelson and McConaughey s Hart and Cohle characters, so there is a chance   even if it s in the form of a novel, or something   we might see them again one day).

Review: True Detective Season Finale
Posted   Monday, March 10th, 2014
by Tierney Monaghan
Going into the season finale, True Detective had a lot of expectations swirling around. Theories about the Yellow King abounded on the Internet. Parody videos proliferated. Writer Nic Pizzolatto was interviewed about whether he d learned anything from the first season of The Killing, a show he worked on previously. People were nervous that True Detective might end in the same way that show had, by not coming to any conclusions at all.
 
When the show arrived, an estimated 11 million people wanted to see how this would end. As many people tried to stream the show on HBO Go, the servers crashed and the wait for the finale continued for several hours.
 
 Form and Void  picks up right where  After You ve Gone  left off last week. The episode opens at the Childress compound, where Errol Childress, the scarred man, is telling a man who is chained to a bed frame that if he behaves, he can have some more water around noon. Errol picks up a slop bucket, and leaves the small cottage, walking back to the main house, which is basically rotting away. In the house is a mentally challenged woman who is both cowed and cuddled by Errol. He asks her to tell him a story again, which turns out to be a description of her molestation by her grandfather.
 
Meanwhile, Hart and Cohle are still on the fishing boat with Sheriff Gerasi, trying to get the real story of what happened in the Marie Fontenot case. Cohle forces Gerasi to watch the video of Fontenot s torture, and he spills the story from there. Gerasi took the original missing persons report on Fontenot. Later, he went back and the report was marked  made in error.  Sheriff Childress had done this, claiming he d spoken to the family and that the girl had been sent to live with her father. Gerasi says that he had nothing else to do with the case, that he was following chain of command. Within a year, he was working for the state CID based on Sheriff Childress  recommendation.
 
Having received all the information they can from Gerasi, Hart and Cohle dock the fishing boat they stole, threaten Gerasi with a sniper if he says anything and head out to continue their investigation. They are still searching for the identity of the scarred man. The definitive clue comes from a picture taken during the canvassing during the Lange case. An elderly woman s recollection of getting her house painted leads Hart and Cohle through the tax records and leads them to the address of Childress & Sons maintenance. 
 
Ever the pessimist, Cohle leaves his boss copies of their investigation notes and the video of Marie Fontenot s torture to be mailed to the authorities and the media. Should he and Hart disappear for more than a day, his boss is to mail the packages, which will hopefully lead the authorities to the Childress compound. Then Hart and Cohle take off to see what is afoot at the address they ve found. This brings us back around to the creepy, overgrown, dilapidated house from the beginning of the episode.
 
The car is barely parked in front of the house when Cohle takes off toward the cottage and fields beyond. Hart knocks on the door, posing as a surveyor who is lost and needs to use the phone. The woman answers the door, and says they don t have a phone. After Cohle yells for him, Hart pushes his way into the house, checking to make sure Errol isn t hiding in there.  He s going to come for you. He s worse than anyone,  the woman warns him. Around this same time, Cohle spots Errol out in the field and takes chase after him. 
 
The chase leads into some sort of catacomb/tunnel system. It s packed with the wicker sculptures that have peppered the crime scenes throughout the episodes. Cohle winds ever deeper through the vine choked passages in pursuit of Errol. As Errol taunts him from the distance, he speeds up, not checking corners as carefully. Entering a large chamber with an opening to the sky, Errol steps from the shadows and skewers Cohle with a large knife. He is lifted of his feet by the force of the thrust, and then dropped on the ground when Hart catches up with them. Hart catches an axe in the chest for his troubles. As Errol leans over him, Cohle manages to sit up and move around enough to shoot Errol in the head. It is an undetermined amount of time later when the authorities arrive and shoot a flare into the sky, which Hart and Cohle see through the hole in the ceiling of the chamber. 
 
Both of the former detectives end up at Lafayette General Hospital. Marty s daughters and Maggie come to visit him, and he falls apart as he tries to convince them he s going to be okay. Cohle ends up in a coma after his surgery, but eventually awakes and hears more about the progress of the case on the news. Hart continually visits him, even making arrangements for where he ll go once he leaves the hospital. One night, Hart wheels his partner outside for a cigarette and the conversation turns to the case and how Cohle sees the whole experience. After he struggles to describe his near death experience, Cohle says that in the end, there is  just one story, the oldest. Light versus dark. 
 
It s a succinct summation of this season of True Detective. It has been an intriguing, occasionally frustrating meditation on light versus dark. I m left with the sense that even though the light won this round, it was a very near thing. Perhaps what this show has done best is to explore the vast gray areas of personal and societal morality. When even the  good guys  struggle to keep the darkness at the edges of their lives, what hope is there for all of us as a whole? Thank you, Rust Cohle. Now I sound as conflicted and pessimistic as you.

HBO's 'True Detective' botches the ending

Matthew McConaughey, left, and Woody Harrelson in "True Detective." LACEY TERRELL
I hate when a good series ends, not just because I will miss the show, but because I so rarely like the endings.
 True Detective  became the latest series to complain about, as HBO's wonderfully tilted mystery series came with a finale that seemed to have little to do with the show we had been watching for the previous seven episodes.
(Spoiler alert: If you are not up to date on  True Detective,  skip to the next item.)
 True Detective  had been the best new series of the year so far, a bizarre and engrossing tale that took the framework of a highly conventional police drama and overlaid it with flowery speech and philosophical ideas, most of them coming from Matthew McConaughey's character, Rust Cohle, a person so badly damaged psychologically as to be almost non-functional.
The storytelling used parallel time tracks and unreliable narration to give the story extra layers of mystery. It was baffling and sometimes hard to follow, but it was always intriguing.
But it came in the guise of a police-buddy drama we had seen 1,000 times before. Cohle's partner, Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), was a hard-working, philandering, family-ignoring homicide detective. Cohle and Hart were the mavericks, bucking the chain of command for ultimately noble causes. They tracked down a serial killer and   of course   found the trail leading through  respectable  society.
We assumed, all along, that at some point the archetype would be shattered in a new and clever way. Instead, we found Sunday that it was our assumptions that would be shattered, and convention would triumph because the show didn't really know how it wanted to end.
Bad guy Errol Childress   there was no last twist   seemed almost laughably absurd and certainly not the sort of villain one expected at the end of the twisted road we had traveled. Worse, the post-climax sequence brought a happy ending and a rescued Rust, a transformation that seemed to come out of the blue.
The story of Cohle and Hart is over and McConaughey and Harrelson have moved on to other projects, but HBO may bring  True Detective  back next year, with a different cast and story altogether. Let's hope creator Nic Pizzolatto thinks that one all the way through to the end.
YOUR  MOTHER' SHOULD KNOW
The ending of another series,  How I Met Your Mother,  has been stirring up the fans before it even has happened.
The March 3 episode appeared to confirm a long-held but faintly embraced hypothesis about the Mother of the title: She's dead.
The conceit of this mild-mannered sitcom is that the show takes place in 2030, and Josh Radnor's character, Ted, is recalling the events of today for his children, explaining to them the torturously long process of how he met their mother. Some fans have speculated that the reason Ted is telling the story is because the mother recently died or is dying.
Like most such theories, it is internally consistent but doesn't make a lot of sense in context. Why would such a light-hearted comedy spend nine years getting to the point of introducing Ted to the mother   whose name we still don't know   just to reveal that she's dead? In the all-time ranking of bad sitcom ideas, that would go near the top, somewhere between  My Mother the Car  and letting Joanie and Chachi have their own show.
Cristin Milioti, who plays the mother, poured a big pitcher of ice water on the notion, bluntly telling the Hollywood Reporter,  That's crazy. 
Any show that has been telegraphing a surprise ending for nine seasons is bound to generate some theories about its finish. We've also heard that Ted is the one who is dead/dying, that there will be some switcheroo with the identity of the mother (it's really Robin!) or that there is some other major twist regarding the veracity of Ted's storytelling.
Most likely, though, is that Ted's longing has to do with being separated from the Mother somehow, and she will return to him in the next-to-last scene, right before they meet for the first time on that train platform, in the rain.

 True Detective  Creator Nic Pizzolatto Reveals Alternate Endings & Shares Season 2 Story Details
'True Detective' Creator Nic Pizzolatto Reveals Alternate Endings & Shares Season 2 Story Details

Talk
" True Detective " has finished, and now the debate begins on its legacy. Did it live up to the promise in the first half of the season? Was the story concluded in a satisfactory manner? Is this really one of the greatest shows in TV history? We ll let you hash it out in the comments section, but in this writer s opinion, there hasn t been a TV drama this dense, rich and satisfying in a long, long time. That said, last night s finale did leave a slightly sour taste in the mouths of some. Obviously, **SPOILERS AHEAD**.
So, in "Form And Void," we saw both Rust and Martin near death, only to survive and spend the last quarter of the show involved in a discussion of light versus dark, and the meaning of the universe. As we wrote in our recap , it was a fitting and rather poetic conclusion, with both men changed from what they ve experienced. But it wasn t the supernatural finale some were hoping for or tragic conclusion some expected. And writer/creator Nic Pizzolatto shares his approach and some of the other ideas he had going into the finale.
"For me as a storyteller, I want to follow the characters and the story through what they organically demand. And it would have been the easiest thing in the world to kill one or both of these guys," Pizzolatto told HitFix . "I even had an idea where something more mysterious happened to them, where they vanished into the unknown and Gilbough and Papania had to clean up the mess and nobody knows what happens to them. Or it could have gone full blown supernatural. But I think both of those things would have been easy, and they would have denied the sort of realist questions the show had been asking all along. To retreat to the supernatural, or to take the easy dramatic route of killing a character in order to achieve an emotional response from the audience, I thought would have been a disservice to the story. What was more interesting to me is that both these men are left in a place of deliverance, a place where even Cohle might be able to acknowledge the possibility of grace in the world."
And it was a smart choice, giving the finale of "True Detective" a true emotional heft (Rust s story about feeling his daughter s presence and love while on the brink of death is awards reel stuff). But perhaps vexing to many was that the conspiracy around the Tuttle churches stayed in the background and was not fully resolved. Martin even quiets Gilbough and Papania when they start explaining where the investigation has gone. But for Pizzolatto, it was all about making the show as real as possible. 
"The conspiracies that I ve researched and encountered, they seem to happen very ad hoc: they become conspiracies when it s necessary to have a conspiracy. I think it would have rang false to have Hart and Cohle suddenly clean up 50 years of the culture history that led to Errol Childress, or to get all the men in that video," he explained. "It s important to me, I think, that Cohle says,  We didn t get em all, Marty,  and Marty says,  We ain t going to. This isn t that kind of world.  This isn t the kind of world where you mop up everything. We discharged our duty, but of course there are levels and wheels and historical contexts to what happened that we ll never be able to touch."
It s a brave position to take, and a choice that leaves the world of "True Detective" as complex and unfair and haunted as it was when we entered. But now, the big question: what s happening with season two? Well, Pizzolatto is already putting pen to paper, for another conspiratorial tale, but one that seems to be more national in scope.
"Okay. This is really early, but I ll tell you (it s about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system," the writer shared. Damn.

HBO original series "True Dectective," starring Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey
Online viewers subjected to endless spinning wheel and error message
Many viewers tuning in online to the March 9 season finale of critically-acclaimed Southern noire series  True Detective,  starring Woody Harrelson and Oscar-winner Matthew McConaughey, were instead subjected to an endless spinning wheel and error message.
HBO is one of the few content distributors that allows authenticated viewers online access to live and recorded programming, which it does via the HBO Go app, presenting much of the content in HD. HBO Go has become a TV Everywhere benchmark   often lauded by Netflix   for its user-friendly operability and resolution, among other features.
 True Detective  has become a new hit for HBO, generating almost 11 million viewers weekly during its eight-episode run. The premium channel claims a global subscriber base of 125 million (via third-party multichannel video program distributors), including more than 28 million in the United States, according to SNL Kagan.
In addition, adding to the pre-finale suspense, McConaughey upon accepting his March 2 Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club revealed he would not be returning for the second season of  Detective. 
With almost 39% of HBO s domestic subscribers watching  Detective  on a weekly basis, it s safe to assume millions more (including many using borrowed HBO Go passwords) watched online, thereby overloading the system.
It s a problem Netflix and Amazon Prime have experienced at times   issues they often attribute to CDN shortfalls and crowded broadband traffic.
In a response on Twitter, HBO issued a boilerplate apology of sorts with few details as what actually happened:  Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDectective, we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon. 
Not surprisingly, the technical issues drew myriad colorful commentary on social media.

True Detective Finale Ratings Soar, Streaming Crashes HBO Go and Season 2 Prep Commences
By
0 comments
HBO cracked the superb ratings code with True Detective, the immensely popular anthology whose season finale on Sunday night blew out the ratings and the HBO Go website in under an hour.
As the True Detective finale got underway last night, scores of viewers on pins and needles flooded the HBO Go website from their computers, iPads, phones and a variety of non-TV devices to live stream the final episode and learn the identity of the Yellow King. So many people tried to watch the True Detective finale live streaming at HBO Go that the website crashed for a period of time.
Setting aside a large number of HBO subscribers that chose to online stream the finale, a total of 3.5 million viewers settled onto their couch to watch it on the HBO channel per Nielsen. That s the highest rated episode of the eight-episode run, easily besting the 2.3 million viewers who tuned in for the premiere.
A total of 11 million unique viewers watched True Detective over the course of its first season. That s the most viewers to tune into a debut season of an HBO series since the Six Feet Under freshman season way back in 2001.
With as big a hit as True Detective has become, it s no surprise that HBO is pushing creator Nic Pizzolatto to get busy on a second season. Pizzolatto and HBO have already confirmed that Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson will not return, and that the next anthology will be all new characters and a new story, ala American Horror Story.
Information is scarce about where the second season might head, but Pizzolatto did share the following with HitFix in an interview.  This is really early, but I ll tell you it s about hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system. 
In case you missed True Detective last night, HBO Go is fully functional today and the season finale is waiting for you.

Streaming glitch spoils HBO GO True Detective finale
SAPA-AP 11 March 2014

HBO says its streaming service is running again, although disappointingly late for many anxious fans of the  True Detective  series.
Most fans who tried to log onto the  HBO GO  stream for the Sunday-night season finale of  True Detective  weren t able to do so because the service crashed. HBO said Monday the service interruption was due to  an excessive amount of traffic  soon after the 9 p.m. Eastern start of the episode. Many viewers saw a spinning circle indicating the show was loading, but it didn t.
HBO had similar issues with its service last year surrounding episodes of  Game of Thrones. 
Company spokesman Jeff Cusson (KEW-sahn) said Monday the service is now working.

As True Detective fans were getting more and more hyped up on Sunday, HBO GO was rapidly approaching disaster. The streaming service had promised to post a stream of True Detective's season finale as the show aired at 9 p.m. ET. But instead the whole site went down. Needless to say, people were devastated. And angry. And hilariously angry.
The network equipment company Sandvine reported on its Internet Phenomena Blog about the outage . Sandvine's data shows HBO GO failing at 9 p.m. right as True Detective was posted, and coming back up between 12:30 and 12:45 a.m.. At that point there's a small, hour-long surge in traffic while night owls (and West Coast dwellers) presumably watched the episode. Then traffic drops off in the early morning before starting to climb again today. It's unclear exactly how much traffic HBO GO deals with on a regular basis or Sunday night in particular, since the company doesn't release figures, so it's difficult to say whether it should have been more prepared.

As the Washington Post points out , people have been speculating that password sharing is partly to blame in HBO GO's reliability woes. Perhaps it isn't preparing for the correct number of users during high traffic times because its estimates of how many people use the service are too low. And this alleged naivete is corroborated by something HBO's CEO told BuzzFeed in January. Richard Plepler said,  It s not that we re unmindful of it, it just has no impact on the business. ... We re in the business of creating addicts.  If the outage was caused by unexpected traffic, then it isn't exactly  no impact. 
Wow @HBOGO is down and I'm trying to watch True Detective. SOMEONE WHO OWNS THE ACCOUNT I USE PAID GOOD MONEY FOR THIS SERVICE.

High demand for 'True Detective' finale crashes HBO Go

High demand for Sunday night's season finale of HBO's "True Detective," starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson as investigators in a more than 15-year hunt for a serial killer, created technical issues for HBO Go, the pay-cable network's on-demand service.
"Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for 'True Detective,' we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users," the HBO Go Twitter account posted. "Please try again soon."

It was not until Mionday morning that the service tweeted, "The issues affecting HBO Go last night have been resolved. Thank you for being patient."
The finale of the critically well-received eight-episode miniseries attracted 3.5 million viewers, up from the Jan. 13 premiere's 2.3 million.
While HBO has not announced a season two, series creator Nic Pizzolatto Monday told Hitfix.com that, "This is really early, but I'll tell you [it's about] hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system." McConaughey has previously said he would not be returning.

 True Detectives  (Jim Bridges/HBO)
 True Detective  went out with a bang on HBO Sunday night, capturing 3.5 million viewers and earning the highest ratings of its eight-episode first season. That may not sound like a lot, but that s a pretty sizable audience for a freshman pay cable drama, and up from the 2.3 million that checked out the season premiere. Clearly, word spread that the show was worth watching.
For comparison s sake, the 3.5 million audience was more than fellow HBO drama  Game of Thrones  attracted in its first season finale (just over 3 million people). It s also higher than  Mad Men  on basic cable, which closed its sixth and most recent season with 2.7 million people last summer.
Compared to other Sunday night Prestige Dramas, however,  True Detective  still has a long way to go. Last season s  GoT  finale got 5.4 million viewers , while AMC s  The Walking Dead  regularly kills it at a level even a broadcast show would die for, with around 16 million tuning in for the midseason premiere last month.
 True Detective  also   not too surprisingly   did well in the social media world. Nielsen s SocialGuide ranked it as the third most-tweeted show of the week, behind  The Walking Dead  and ABC Family s  Pretty Little Liars.  (That measures three hours before, during and three hours after the broadcast.)
For the show s initial airing between 9 and 10 p.m., 23,649 people tweeted using the terms  true detective  or  #truedetective.  Over the last 24 hours, there have been 166,775 tweets using those phrases. As for specific moments, viewers were really excited about the climactic events that happened in Carcosa at 9:41 p.m., tweeting up a storm right then   tweets also spiked at 9:03 p.m. and 9:57 p.m., a more predictable pattern.

March 10, 2014
A few final stray thoughts on the 'True Detective' finale before we all go back to obsessing over more frivolous things:
One of the main complains about the last epsiode was that Rust Cohle's newfound optimism in the final reels felt unearned. Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) had for so long been such an extreme pessimist and cynic that his final movement toward a more optimistic worldview didn't compute or so the argument goes. I think this is miguided for several reasons.
Solving a case that has been bothering you for a good chunk of 17 years and coming close to death while doing so just might lead you to, I don't know, have a change of heart. But others don't see it that way. The terrific Emily Nussbaum, for example, snarkily writes that Marty was "'fine, just fine,' recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness." After what they have been through, is this really so odd? Would the experience really not elicit existential feelings in nearly everyone?
Similarly, while I probably have less religious feeling than 99% of the people in this country, for Willa Paskin to write , "I think maybe True Detective ended with Rust Cohle finding God? Talk me off the ledge," and add that it all seemed "cheesy and mystical" seemed a tad unfair. The show did go some way to explaining why people depart from materialist views of the world, however objectively incorrect those views might be.
But my central complaint against this argument is that it sidelines what was so touching and powerful about the ending; namely, that McConaughey was making a gesture towards his partner. In scene after scene over eight episodes, Marty mocked Rust's nihilism and showed impatience with his anti-religious rants. One, in particular, took place at a rural church, where McConaughey heaped scorn on the believers. I thus saw the final scene as McConaughey trying to establish a closer connection with Harrelson, and taking a step towards the latter's less cynical view of the world. None of this means that either man is going to become an optimist or a believer (or that, per Nussbaum, we are supposed to believe that Marty's "fine" line means all is in fact swell). 
Moreover, it's not as if McConaughey is in the process of becoming a full-blown fundamentalist. It is thus odd for Spencer Korbhaber, on The Atlantic's excellent roundtable , to write that "Rust scoffed at tent worshippers, and the Carcosa cult s belief in the supernatural had terrible consequences, but Rust ends up joining all of them by buying into comforting, irrational mumbo jumbo." So saying you are slightly optimistic about the course of humanity is the same as being a fundamentalist Christian at a (presumably very strict) church, or joining a cult that kills children?
To return to Nussbaum's complaint about the tidy wrap-up of Hart's personal journey, I also think many of the critics have been much too hard on the brief, awkward scene in which Hart's estranged family comes to see him in the hospital. It's true that this was another instance of peripheral, female characters given very little to do; but it was also sad and moving because it displayed the ways in which, even in his heroic moment, Harrelson's prior behavior left him wounded and alone.
For those who found the wrap-up too tidy and light (as opposed to dark, to use Rust's formulation), it is worth remembering that the show had one other "light" wrap-up three episodes earlier, in which the supposed killers were caught, the cops were heroes, and all seemed briefly well with the world. And how long did that last? It is certainly relevant that the creative team behind the show chose to end it on the note that they did, but I don't think we are meant to read too much into these final nice moments. This is still a dark show with two characters who are not going to be permanently cured of their difficulties. 
Still, the more I read about the actual plot makes me think that the critics do have a point about the laziness of the wrap-up. The clue that led to the men cracking the case open was pathetically unbelievable; the actual details of what the cult was up to, and to what degree it interacted or steered clear of the central murders, was hazy in the extreme; and the personal story of the killer's connection to the Tuttle clan was underexplained. Not only did this slightly dampen the effect of the last half hour, but it will also, I think, make the idea of rewatching the series less compelling.

"Who was the Yellow King?" and all your other True Detective questions, answered.
Photo still from True Detective   2014 Home Box Office
As Rust Cohle warned us at the end of Episode 3 of True Detective,   This is a world where nothing is solved .  At the end of the first season, the show didn t so much explain all the answers as gesture toward them, leaving us to fill in the blanks (or, perhaps, plot holes). Below, we take our best crack at answering the finale s big questions.
What movie was Errol watching at the beginning of the finale? And what was with all the creepy accents?
Errol is watching North by Northwest . True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto explained his thinking behind this scene in an interview with Alan Sepinwall :
There was this idea that when he talks in his real voice, it s very slurred because of the scarring. My background for him was that he learned how to enunciate properly through watching all these old VCR movies.

How were the Tuttles involved?
It remains unclear whether the Tuttles were directly involved in Errol s crimes or whether they just helped cover them up. Toward the end of the finale, a newscaster says that rumors of a suggested family tie between the senator and Errol Childress had been denied. But we know better: They re closely related, and the reverend, at least, was in deep. It seems likely that his powerful cousin was a part of the conspiracy, too, if not a participant in the crimes.
The reverend s father and the senator s uncle, Sam Tuttle, was Errol s grandfather. He raped both Errol and Errol s sister, and he was open enough about his sexual appetites that his housekeeper, at least whom we met in Episode 7 was well aware of them. Reverend Tuttle knew more: He kept a videotape of Marie Fontenot s rape (and perhaps her murder), which occurred in the place Errol called Carcosa, in his safe. What s more, Reverend Tuttle helped cover up the sexual abuse that took place at one of his Wellspring schools, in part by dismissing a deacon and claiming that it was due to charges of embezzlement. Did he orchestrate the abuse as well? True Detective doesn t say.
How did Papania find Rust and Marty in order to save them?
Presumably Marty is eventually able to find a working phone in the house to call him, though the episode doesn t show this happen.
Why does Rust say,  L chaim, fat ass ? Isn't that kind of a random thing for a nihilist Texan to say?
The short answer is the Rule of Cool . (If something s awesome enough, you don t need to explain it.) The slightly longer answer is that the quote seems to be a reference to Daredevil comics. Here s the panel in which Marvel superhero uses the line as a kiss-off to his archrival .

Who was the Yellow King?

(Costume designer Jenny Eagan confirmed this in our interview .)
At Carcosa, how was Errol able to make his voice appear to be everywhere at once?
Since Pizzolatto has said that   there is nothing supernatural   about the crimes in True Detective, it seems safe to assume that this, like Cohle s final swirling cosmic vision, is a hallucination. (Either that, or Errol s  Carcosa  has really crazy acoustics.)
Is there really a fort like that in Louisiana?
Yes. The Carcosa scenes were filmed on location at Fort Macomb , which was built in 1822.

Why did Errol draw so much attention to Dora Lange even lighting the fire that drew the police to her body?
Advertisement
Pizzolatto offered his explanation in an interview with Entertainment Weekly :
You can tell there are certain times he wants people to notice him. Childress was signaling to the authorities both his presence and the presence of the men who made him.
What does Errol mean when he says,  My ascension removes me the disc in the loop? 
Errol s mythology perhaps can t be reasonably explained the simplest answer seems to be simply  he s crazy  but Pizzolatto offered his own explanation to Entertainment Weekly:
In the beginning, when he says,  My ascension removes me the disc in the loop,  he s describing the cosmology of eternal recurrence of various characters, including Cohle and Reggie Ledoux hit upon, and he s hitting upon his personal mythology. When he says,  It s been weeks since I left my mark, would they have eyes to see,  we can tell from that that he s angling for a reckoning, for a showdown. He s waiting for it. He believes the murders ritually enacted over a period of time, upon his death, permit him an ascension that removes him from the Karmic wheel of rebirth.
Advertisement
Why is the finale called  Form and Void ?
It s a reference to Genesis 1:2 :
And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
This also ties back to Rust s closing speech. Rust reminds Marty,  Once there was only dark. You ask me, the light s winning.  It isn t until the following verse that God says,   Let there be light . 
What was up with the flower motif?
It may have been just a coincidence. In our interview with True Detective costume designer Jenny Eagan, we asked her if there was any hidden meaning to all the flowers featured in the costumes. She told us,   No, not really . 
Do painters really get paint on their ears?
Advertisement
We put this question to Alan of the All Los Angeles Painting Company :
Sometimes? Not normally. You might get a few drops on them. Unless you re a member of the Three Stooges, or something. When you re an experienced painter, no, it s very rare. Unlesssss never mind, no. No, any level of experience, and it wouldn t happen, unless you were spraying all over and you weren t wearing a mask. And then you would have paint everywhere, not just on your ears.
What do we know about Season 2?
Not much. From that same Alan Sepinwall interview with Pizzolatto :
This is really early, but I ll tell you (it s about) hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system.

True Detective Finale Crashes HBO GO
True Detective Finale Crashes HBO GO
10 Comments
Millions attempting to watch the series finale online were confronted instead by a gray screen featuring the flat circle of time as an endless buffering loop.
The final episode of HBO's breakout hit True Detective was watched by millions on their cable feeds last night, but many viewers tuning in online via HBO GO didn't have it that easy.
Complaints about poor service started popping up on Twitter and a Reddit sub dedicated to True Detective shortly after the 9 p.m. ET start of the eighth and final episode of the series. The show, created by Nic Pizzolatto, follows two detectives played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson during their decades-long search for a cultish killer in the Louisiana bayous. The narrative winds up being equal parts whodunit, nihilist bromance, and name check on obscure weird fiction tales from the 19th century.
As the Internet blew up Sunday night with kvetching about the no show by HBO GO, the network tweeted this:
Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective , we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.
  HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014
Several hours later, everything seemed to be resolved, though not without leaving millions of True Detective fans gnashing their teeth about their own descent into an online Carcosa featuring the flat circle of time as an endless buffering loop:
And, for those of you who aren't stuck in HBO Go-Cosa, here is your True Detective GIFcap. Middle fingers forever: //t.co/yVQx8eD1qa
  Vulture (@vulture) March 10, 2014
"Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of True Detective, HBO GO was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9 p.m. ET last night. The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal," an HBO GO spokesperson said in an email sent to PCMag on Monday.
So how many True Detective viewers were affected by the service disruption? The show has averaged nearly 11 million viewers a week over its eight-episode run, according to The Daily Beast . That's about 38 percent of HBO's estimated 28.7 million subscribers, the site noted, leaning on stats from media research firm SNL Kagan.
And how many of those subscribers tried to watch the series finale online? That's tough to say, though as Grantland's John Lopez quipped , perhaps the biggest revelation of True Detective turned out to be that "HBO GO has a limit to how many people can share their passwords at one time: 11 million."

Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) had a lot to say about life, philosophy and beer on HBO's True Detective, which wrapped its first season Sunday night.
Lacey Terrell/HBO
[This piece contains a detailed discussion of Sunday night's True Detective finale. If you haven't seen it and you plan to see it and you don't want to know what happens, stop reading.]
[Seriously, information ahoy.]
Spoiler alert: The dirty-faced, crazy-talking, disheveled impoverished guy did it.
Because we are talking about True Detective, this tells you very little, since Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) spent most of these eight episodes moving through a landscape of desperately poor, semi-coherent, literally unwashed people who might or might not be monsters. And in the end, one of them was. And after an almost comically lengthy sequence in which Rust, gun at the ready, tracked him through a labyrinthine maze of increasingly intricate wooden structures, he knifed Russ, put a hatchet in Marty, and then got shot in the head. The bad guy died, and the good guys lived.
Marty's wife and daughters returned to him, and he and Rust lived to share a lovely talk about near-death experiences in which Rust essentially ended (once you made out what the heck that last line even was) on a vaguely positive note.
There was a lot to admire about True Detective: As many before me have stated, it contained two of the best performances television's celebrated "golden age" has offered from Harrelson and McConaughey, and its tone and aesthetic were often gorgeously realized, as in a stunning shot of a road weaving through an array of forked white trees.
Creator Nic Pizzolatto knew exactly what he was going for when it comes to tone, and he went for it consistently, skillfully and inventively. The car chats between Rust and Marty, in which Rust was allowed to echo the great philosophers and Marty was allowed, at times, to put a pin in his grandiose blather, were fantastic from the start, and they kept being fantastic right through the reunion of the two in the 2012 scenes. (I particularly enjoyed Rust's self-consciously poetic reference to humanity as "sentient meat," followed by Marty's puzzled, "What's scented meat?" Indeed, Marty. Indeed.) He's an enormously stylish writer and, together with director Cary Fukunaga, he created a gorgeously immersive universe.
But True Detective is still a detective show, and it devoted a lot of real estate to its central mystery, which ultimately led to little more than "a monster in the woods did it." Little things that seemed like clues   the repetitions of five figures standing in a circle, the now notorious "yellow king" business, the mystical chattering from various witnesses   just sort of turned out to mean "a bunch of crazy people used to do crazy, monstrous stuff out in the woods." Certainly, the false resolution to the case in 1995 allowed for a couple of critical character moments, particularly Rust saving Marty from being prosecuted for blowing a guy's head off in anger. But an awful lot of time was spent mucking around with some pretty cliched visions of drug dealers who sort of had nothing to do with anything.
I don't think Pizzolatto cared at all about the drug stuff in the early-middle part of the show, which is why those episodes got so slack and dull. The personal stories at that time weren't at their best, either; they were focused on Marty's affair and his violent beating of a guy who made the mistake of being with a woman Marty believed he owned. Other than the heavily hyped long take at the end of the fourth episode that wound its way through the disastrous undercover operation, the show didn't really make a lot of headway between the end of the pilot and the fifth episode, at which point it became more about the complicated interplay between Marty and Rust, and thus became instantly more interesting. In the end, it was gripping in the pilot, slow in episodes 2 to 4, terrific in episodes 5 to 7, and very ordinary in the finale.
What True Detective felt, in the end, was unedited. It felt like it needed another pass, where someone could have told Pizzolatto when Rust was tipping over from an intriguing portrait into a caricature, and when there needed to be a little more story in the story.
Pizzolatto told Alan Sepinwall after the finale that to believe Rust is full of it is to believe Nietzsche is full of it:
For people who thought Cohle's philosophy was simply hogwash, be aware that you're calling Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche hogwash. Just be aware of that. That is not, in fact, a college freshman stoned eating a pizza talking about life; that's Arthur Schopenhauer's thoughts on life.
With all due respect to Pizzolatto's commitment to great philosophers, college freshmen have, in fact, been known to get stoned, eat pizza, quite correctly quote Nietzsche, and still be utterly full of patoot. The issue was never whether the substance of Rust's philosophy was invalid; it was whether Rust's way of talking about it felt more sophisticated or more affected   more like a philosopher or more like a dialogue writer. The very long "time is a flat circle" conversation, for instance, amounted to a very long interpretation of the idea of history repeating itself, which, without more, isn't something one necessarily needs to hear a character explain in great detail while the show surrounds it with indicators of portent.
Kept in perspective, as a very uneven but ultimately highly creative passion project that features some of the best acting you'll see on any screen of any size this year, True Detective is entirely successful. What it isn't is great. To make great television is to understand its episodic structure and to pace it properly. To make a great mystery is to make the conclusion seem like a culmination of the work that has gone into the solution rather than a sense that time expired, so the monster on the hook at the time the music stops is as good a solution to the mystery as any other.
We'd be lucky to have more showrunners as ambitious as Pizzolatto was about trying to say something about good and evil and philosophy, and certainly to have directors as skilled as Fukunaga at creating memorable visuals. But there turned out to be less here than sometimes met the eye, and in the end, a lot of evidentiary traps were set and never sprung.

Brilliant, weird noir series True Detective had its season finale last night, and the ending probably wasn't what most viewers expected. There were a lot of problems with the way this mystery was resolved, but the show did do one thing gloriously right. Spoilers ahead!
Advertisement
I'm going to start with what I consider to be the season finale's master stroke.
GOOD: The Ending Didn't Answer All Our Questions
Advertisement
What I loved about this episode was that all the most elaborate theories that fans spun out turned out to be wrong. The series didn't become meta-commentary about how we're all trapped in a narrative, nor did we ever discover the true meanings of Carcosa and the Yellow King. Instead, it turned out that the guy killing kids was indeed (as we suspected for at least two episodes) Errol Childress, a schizophrenic child molester who had himself been abused as a child. He was working with a few friends who were also child molesters.
Before you get all freaked out and start yelling at me that THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF OTHER MEANINGS   yes, I grant you that, and I will talk about them in a second. But for now, just sit back and consider that if you simply look at what the story gave us, we are left with absolutely no explanation for why Errol and his buddies were obsessed with Carcosa and the Yellow King. Why the antlers and the spirals and stick pyramids? There is no explanation other than Errol's insanity. We do see a gloriously spooky Yellow King in Errol's murder cave, and Rust hallucinates Carcosa (I loved that moment), but we never find out who came up with this imagery or what it means. It just gets explained away in one line about "child molesters into voodoo."
We also never truly find out how many members of the Tuttle/Childress clan are involved in the child sacrifice rituals. When Rust frets about this in the hospital after he and Marty have caught and killed Errol, Marty basically tells him to shut up. Of course the evil men in power weren't caught, he says to Rust. "That ain't what kind of world it is," he continues. "But we got ours."

Basically, this part of the ending was perfect. Nothing is resolved, and that's true to the realist spirit of the series.
It also served as an example of Rust's nihilist philosophy. There is no meaning in anything. It's all just a bunch of sentient meatsacks repeating the horrors they've experienced over and over. Looked at in that way, it was the perfect nose-thumbing at fans who searched like crazy for deeper meanings in this story. Humans are doomed to look for meaning where none exists.

And now, here's where the episode went terribly wrong.
BAD: The White Trash Villain
For a show that has been so nuanced and smart about how Louisiana's downfall is the result of powerful men abusing its citizens, this ending was about as stupid as you can get when it comes to politics. In an earlier episode, we learned that serial killer Errol was basically the product of the abusive Sam Tuttle, father to a political dynasty that spans government, the church and law enforcement. We also know he was victimized by his father, his face burned when he was a child.
Advertisement
To underscore how much Errol is still a part of this powerful family, we discovered in last night's episode that he's living in what seems to be a broken-down mansion, possibly even the old Tuttle estate, and his crimes have been covered up with the help of his powerful family   some of whom participate in this death rituals.
And yet when we finally do see Errol in his element, he's collapsed down into the worst kind of caricature of white trash. I felt like I was watching Redneck Zombies, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, that episode of X-Files with the two brothers who keep their mother under the bed. The episode begins with him telling his "daddy," who is tied up mostly naked in a shack, that he might bring him water if he's good. Then he traipses over to his mansion, speaking in a variety of accents for no discernible reason, to have sex with his sister in piles of filth. His body and his sister's body are displayed for the camera as the ultimate grotesques, and later when Marty explores their mansion it's clear that we are meant to feel nauseated by these hoarder scum.
It felt as if the entire series had been building up to a real revelation about the rottenness at the heart of Louisiana, but instead we just got this impoverished guy having sex with his sister and acting out the perfect stereotype of poor Southern whites. Instead of a political or even a spiritual explanation for the murders, we're basically told that this is just what trash does. They're just crazy and disgusting. Sure, their awfulness is connected to the tidied-up nastiness of the Tuttles, but we never actually see the Reverend Tuttle traipsing about semi-naked fucking his sister.

I don't mean that I think Rust and Marty should have busted the whole Tuttle clan. That's not realistic, and I'm glad the show insisted on reminding us that rich criminals don't come to justice. What I mean is that ultimately the horrors we've seen, and the Carcosa death art, are all ultimately traced back to Errol's handiwork. His mind has spawned this horror, and his voice haunts the Yellow King's shrine.
We are left with an image of Errol's maimed, obese body and filth-encrusted house as the source of all the series' darkness. This feels much too simple, and too pat. Previous episodes gave us such inventive, subtle and realistic examples of horror, from a perverted justice system to a charter school system that churns out ignorant children. Instead of giving us a meaty, complex villain whose name might well be "Louisiana," this season finale gave us an absurd, fantastical stereotype.
Evil, this episode suggests, is white trash crossed with voodoo religion. Somehow, the victims of Louisiana's power elite became the perpetrators in this episode. It feels like a betrayal of everything that came before.

BAD: The Happy Ending
As I said earlier, I can forgive the show for never explaining any of the elaborate symbols of the five beer can people and M-Brane theory and obscure 19th century weird fiction. I think it's a bold way to spank the audience for trying to make meaning out of the void. Plus, there are a zillion productive ways people can analyze what the Yellow King and Carcosa meant, and how it ties into the Tuttle Ministries.
You don't need a tidy "this is what it all meant" ending to enjoy all the visual references and literary analogies in this series. In fact, a pat ending would shut down symbols whose power comes from their very ambiguity.

That said, the writer/director pair of Nic Pizzolatto and Cary Joji Fukunaga made a seriously bizarre decision to end this season happily, with suicidal pessimist Rust finally seeing the light. Literally. We get a final speech from him about how when he was in a coma he felt the texture of a new kind of darkness beneath the other darkness   the "form" in the void perhaps   and felt the pure love of his dead daughter there. And now, when he looks at the darkness of the night sky with its sparse spray of illuminated stars, he believes "the light is winning."
Because . . . why? I get that he's resolved this major problem that's been plaguing him for a decade, and that he's repaired his (actually pretty adorable) relationship with Marty. And I'm glad he's gotten some relief from his sense that life is meaningless. He even got to cry in a manly way with Marty. But this ending feels tacked on, and not in an ironic way.
I am a big proponent of character arcs that show us how people change over time. But this transformation feels like what happens in the final moments of horror movies when the characters escape from the demon in the caves, or the monster in their dreams, or the serial killers in the woods, and suddenly the birds are singing and the police are there to rescue them and a stagey mood of relief pours over everyone as the credits roll.
Advertisement
I think a semi-legitimate argument could be made that this ending is kind of like the fakey-fake happy ending of Blue Velvet, where the mechanical bird sings outside the sitcom-colored kitchen after everybody has been raped and nearly murdered, etc. If that was Pizzolatto and Fukunaga's intent, it didn't really work.
This show was weird emo gothic, not irony-laced postmodernism. There's no reason it couldn't have been both, but it wasn't. I think a lot of us responded intensely to True Detective because it was so incredibly earnest. That's what made it heartbreaking and involving. Regardless of whether the happy ending was intended seriously or ironically, it sold out a show whose intentions were pure and whose characters sought justice in their own personal hells.
I'm going to have to class True Detective's first season with so many other shows that were great until the final episode(s) and then lost their way. I still love this show, but I would have preferred no ending at all to this one.

HBO GO hit over an hour of downtime due to demand for True Detective finale
Yesterday night, HBO GO suffered from downtime for over an hour. The HBO GO Twitter account responded to an outcry over the downtime and requested that users tried again soon. HBO GO suffered the downtime due to the demand of the finale of the show True Detective starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. McConaughey recently won an Oscar for best actor for the movie Dallas Buyers Club.
<<<<235

All Stories
"We only did three takes on that, and I think that was the last take that we wound up using," Fukunaga said. "I just let Matthew go. We rolled one take into the next, and that s where he got to on his own. The conversations we ve had about where he was at psychologically and physically were all part of getting to that but in terms of shaping his performance at that moment? I didn t have to do anything."
5 things we learned from True Detective
Elsewhere in the interview, Fukunaga addressed some of the finale's eeriest elements, like the labyrinth Cohle and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) track serial killer Errol Childress through. The scene was originally set in a cypress forest, but when they had to re-plan the ending, Fukunaga pitched Fort Macomb outside of New Orleans "as if the cult had taken over some factory or something on the bayou and repurposed it," said Fukunaga.
"Childress had turned it into some cat-and-mouse-like maze to entrap these children and adolescents," he said. "There was a bridal path described in the script that a larger section of chambers in the fort worked perfectly for. It s hard to tell but there's a spiral-like nature to the maze and once you get to the final section before the altar room, the funnel grows smaller and smaller and smaller."
The many spirals littered throughout True Detective reached an apex during the episode as well when Cohle hallucinated a massive vortex before being attacked by Errol in the altar room. While Fukunaga wouldn't say how Pizzolatto originally envisioned that moment for fear he might get in trouble, he said the formation Cohle sees creates a neat bookend for that crucial symbol. "I liked the idea that we could actually see Carcosa and black stars," he added. "If you look really closely, you can see black orbs floating in it. It was important to me that if we're gonna talk about these things, let's see them one more time before we finish."
Fukunaga also spoke about striking a balance between the show's two detectives throughout the first season's run: While Cohle and his philosophizing became the centerpiece of True Detective for many fans, the director said he felt Hart's troubled relationship with his family was its true heart.
"I always felt those interactions with the family were the most tangible examples of how behavior affects those around you," Fukunaga said. "Cohle is this lone wolf on the outside and he can philosophize but you don't really see how he or his behavior affects other people. He's purposely isolated. There were more scenes with Hart's family that didn t make it into the show, about his daughter and his relationship with Maggie. I always found that stuff the most interesting to shoot in terms of human drama."
While Pizzolatto will be behind True Detective's second season, Fukunaga will not return. Still, the director offered up some advice to whoever takes the helm next year: "'You can email me.' We didn't finish until a couple weeks ago. I guess, 'Start training now.' It's a doozy."

'True Detective' Was Ultimately About the Journey, Not the Finale
Lacey Terrell/HBO
McConaughey and Harrelson in the "True Detective" finale.
In this story
The finale had its flaws and may not have satisfied everyone, but the series had made its mark well before the end -- with writing and acting more important than plot.
This column contains spoilers to the season finale of True Detective. Watch before reading.
It's likely that wherever you fell on the spectrum about the need for, the execution of and the overall satisfaction surrounding the final mystery in HBO's terrific True Detective, depended on what show you were watching.
Because True Detective, the eight-episode anthology series starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, was very much a tale of two shows. Television is a writer's medium first, followed closely by the need for talented actors to pull off and bring to life that dialogue.
True Detective's brilliance indeed lies hard in the writing and the acting, so watching Rust and Marty talking in cars was a magnificent combination of both. You probably couldn't sell a story about existential cops in a pitch meeting, but series creator Nic Pizzolatto's exceptional prose sealed the deal and the series got made.
TV RATINGS: 'True Detective' Finale Scores Series High
Beyond existential cops who struggle with their relationship to each other and the relationships around them, True Detective was about a bizzare collection of serial murders, the occult, the strange off-the-grid nature of rural Louisiana and about how the emotionally corrosive nature of police work -- especially when it touches on humanity's darkest sides -- can rot even the strongest man from the inside.
That murder mystery -- who killed a girl and then elaborately staged a satanic death altar in the middle of a remote field? -- was essentially the motor that fueled the series (as too were the other unexplained deaths and missing children reports that detectives Hart and Cohle were piecing together). But if finding out the whodunit was the motivating factor for watching True Detective, then you were watching mostly for a different reason than those of us who could have watched Rust talk to Marty on a road trip across the country, with no murder to solve at all.
That's why leading up to the finale -- a new cast and a different story will be in place in season two -- there seemed a need to tamp down wild and speculative theories about who did it and what all the devil worshipping elements really meant. Pizzolatto himself downplayed the actual mystery as the essential part of the series, but viewers are conditioned to want answers (and, too often, ones that close out the mystery in black and white).
STORY: HBO Go Crashes During 'True Detective' Finale
Taking that into consideration and, ultimately, how the relationship between Rust and Marty changed in the finale, it wasn't the greatest of endings. But neither did it detract from the overall impact of the series, Pizzolatto's clear talent, the superb acting by everybody on the series but especially McConaughey and Harrelson, plus the beautiful directing of Cary Joji Fukunaga.
True Detective ends its first season as a thrilling, conceptually intriguing idea brought to life by vivid and memorable language and two magnificent acting performances.
But as the ending goes, there seemed to be enough shortened payoff to probably irritate those strictly in the mystery camp and, for the rest of us, the reversal of Rust's nihilistic tendencies in a too-pat metaphor of darkness and light brawling for supremacy in the world (and our souls).
We found out the killer -- Erroll Childress, who worked up and down the coast as a maintenance worker at rural schools. He was freaky squared, but we barely knew anything about him until this final episode, and while that didn't offset for me the power of the series, it just emphasizes after the fact that the actual crimes in True Detective were handled rather straightforwardly and thus were the backdrop to a stage where we got to see Rust and Marty essentially waiting for Godot, or if you prefer the mythology of the series, either The Yellow King or Carcosa. Thus, what Rust and Marty were doing professionally was less important than how they went about it, what they said during it and how it destroyed them in the process.
But since Pizzolatto intriguingly set out in this world of his the mythology of The Yellow King and Carcosa, some people will feel like they didn't get the answers or the meanings they desired.
And yet, despite loving so much about True Detective, it seemed that other aspects of the finale were more disappointing than not getting concrete answers. For example, the compelling flashback and flash-forward element that whiplashed these eight episodes to and fro was riveting, but in the finale, Rust in particular looked a lot more vibrant than any time we saw him being interviewed by detectives Gilbough (Michael Potts) and Papania (Tory Kittles).
STORY: HBO's 'True Detective' Is Averaging 10.9 Million Viewers
Could his time spent reunited with Marty, working the case as private detectives, have brought more focus and purpose to his life than when he was drinking beers all day and cutting them up with a knife? Sure. But to have Rust in that bright white designer shirt and showing cat-quick reflexes with his gun while tracking Childress, something seemed a bit off there.
And, also minorly troubling, True Detective had a beautiful, strange look to it as untraditional, unfamiliar Louisiana became a palette for Fukunaga. But the finale had a moment -- where Rust has a vision inside Carcosa just before Childress gets the jump on him -- that was a visual trick, an outlier that hadn't been employed. And in the waning minutes of the finale, we got Rust portrayed in several Christ-like images and poses that was a departure from much of the original cinematography. Meaning, had Fukunaga and Pizzolatto tried to infuse previous visuals (outside of the occult elements) into metaphors, we would have known that it was part of their intention, part of the show's ongoing visual narrative. But to add such stark elements at the end seemed a bit forced. Included in this aspect was shooting Rust's perspective of Marty, while sitting in the wheelchair, from so low that Marty's head became like an enormous illuminated planet, with the stars and the dark skies behind him.
Since that leaked into the duo's discussion about darkness and light and recalled Rust's star-gazing past in Alaska, there was at least a verbal precedent. But to attach so much visual meaning to those final moments seemed a stretch. It was enough for Rust to find some sliver of hope without having to layer on these visual tricks.
But none of that was ultimately a deal-breaker. In fact, the deal was already locked in place in those early, dialogue and existential heavy moments between Rust and Marty in the car. Those "time is a flat circle" days of two disparate men bantering was the hook that True Detective set in me. Getting all the puzzle pieces together (or not) was of less interest all along.

The Disappointing Finale of  True Detective 
By
  
March 10, 2014
Two weeks ago, I published a critical article about HBO s  True Detective  in which I argued that, as stylish and as well acted as the series was, it had a hollow center. Beneath its auteurist trappings, the show boiled down to bickering cops hunting a sinister  rape club  a plot that has been done to death, so to speak, on many better shows.  True Detective  also had a funky gender problem: it was about the evil of men who treat women as lurid props, but the show treated women as lurid props. And, though the dialogue was deeply, sometimes deadly serious, those layers of Lovecraft and nihilism just felt like red herrings.
Well, as of the finale, I ve changed my mind about one thing, at least: Rust Cohle s monologues weren t window dressing. They were the whole point but I don t mean that in a good way. In the finale, we discovered that the Spaghetti Man a.k.a. the lawnmower man, a.k.a. the hulking guy with scars was indeed our serial killer. A perverted mastermind with a cave full of skulls and thorns, he was diddling his disabled sister inside their Grey Gardens wreck of a mansion; he also had some serious elder abuse going on, a plot that gave me flashbacks to the hilarious movie  Cold Comfort Farm  ( I saw something nasty in the woodshed! ). I relished this surreal, sick, and frankly nasty opening sequence, which led deep into the territory of the notorious  X-Files  episode  Home,  but after that everything went downhill.
To summarize: Our boys intimidated a corrupt cop with a videotape (he howled upon seeing the un-seeable, then screamed  Chain of command! ). They Googled documents and visited witnesses and had Sherlockian insights about green paint. There was a meeting with one of the African-American cops, who turned out to be the good cop. There were endless conversations in the car, about issues like whether Rust held back in that fistfight, and about Rust s argument that Marty should be blamed for  pushing a good woman to the point where she had to use me.  (Of course, Maggie couldn t have actually wanted to screw Rust, out of revenge or because the man had been flexing his arms at her for years; that would mean she had desires beyond being a plot device.)
About two-thirds of the way into the hour, there was an extended game of Marco Polo in the ruins, a truly ridiculous head butt, two stabbings, and a gunshot. No involvement of Marty s father-in-law; no payoff on the goth daughter angle; no payoff on a lot of things, actually, like that mysterious convict who died in his cell.  Errol  was behind all the show s central crimes: he d participated in drugging a prostitute and decorating her in antlers; he d helped organize the  Eyes Wide Shut  club with the girls in blindfolds; he was behind the kiddie-porn preschool molestation in the school basement; and then, of course, there was that ancient incestuous family to tend. He also got solid ratings as a housepainter. The masked figures behind the larger conspiracy went free, including the powerful Tuttle family although I haven t entirely sorted out the details, maybe because so many of them didn t make any sense.
There was a hospital scene between Marty and his wife and kids that was so abstract, it might as well have featured a silent-movie card reading  Forgiven!  And, over the show s last twenty minutes, as in the finale of  Lost,  the series became a meditation on how our heroes healed from their psychic wounds and became buddies again. Marty was  fine, just fine,  recovered from years of Match Personals and TV dinners. Rust had a touching dream about his dead daughter, in which he glimpsed light beneath the darkness. They were able to move on, to forgive themselves for their own mistakes (Marty) or find optimism in their nihilism (Rust).
I am certain there are people who found all this experimental and profound. To me, it was a near-total wash. And what was most striking was that every one of show s gross-out victims the dead  prosts,  the raped little girls with the blindfolds, the genderqueer hooker who had been raped as a boy and filmed for porn movies, Marty s own screwed-up daughter were just there to ease our heroes into these epiphanies. After all that talk about how the two men hadn t  averted their eyes  to evil, the show did just that. And it ends with stories told in the stars? We re in Successories territory here, and even great actors can t pull that off.
As I said in the review, it s no fun to pan a show that people love (pleasure is an argument for itself, after all). But I ll certainly be relieved when this series stops blocking people s view of the other television that s out there, including the mysteries I touched on in my piece, like  Top of the Lake  and  The Fall,  as well as  Broadchurch,   Spiral,   The Returned,  and the terrific new season of  The Americans  varied and excellent thrillers that got far less press than  True Detective,  in part because they didn t have the imprimatur of HBO and manly movie stars. The second season of  Orange Is the New Black  is on its way, and so is  Game of Thrones.  Fingers crossed that there s some other drama in my pile of screeners to show me fresh possibilities! Just spare me anything atmospheric: I ve had enough hot air.

Flat Circles, Pagan Spirals, And How  True Detective s First Season Was A Critique Of Binary Thinking
CREDIT: HBO
This review discusses plot points from the full run of True Detective in detail.
 The light is winning,  True Detective s Rust concedes at the end of the HBO hit s first season. Or it s got the momentum, at least, even if the deficit displayed on the scoreboard remains monumental. After seven-plus hours of his paeans to darkness and the inexorable pointlessness and tragedy of human existence, Rust s closing line throws everything that came before it into a very different, well, light.
A number of critics (including on this site) find fault with that last-second reversal, labeling it a betrayal or holding it as emblematic of the show s ultimate punt on many of the big questions of power, corruption, violence, and institutions  control of individuals that it had seemed to raise. But it s worth setting the question of whether or not True Detective kept its thematic promises aside for at least a moment to appreciate the technical craftsmanship of the storytelling that brings Rust through the improbable arc.
True Detective is built around binary relationships   optimist and pessimist, cop and crook, faithful and bereft. The usefulness and failings of these binaries are a recurring background presence in the season, and in some ways the show has more to say about binaries than it does about any of its plot-level ideas. Rust s concession (or perhaps it s a revelation of some long-lit and tightly guarded spark of optimism in him, which could explain why a committed pessimist who s bad at parties would bother not just to bear witness to the  raw deal  nature s offered humankind, but to be police, to be one of the bad men who keep other bad men from the door) is a shift in one of these binaries, and it s worth examining it specifically to think about the broader structure that drove the HBO hit s first season.
Throughout True Detective s first season, creator Nic Pizzolato relies upon two combating shapes: the open spiral and the closed circle.  Time is a flat circle,  in Rust s idle (and meme-friendly) philosophizing, and Pizzolatto s camera finds visual examples of that closed loop notion in highway interchanges and the bottoms of Lone Star tallboys and the drum magazine on Reggie Ledoux s AK-47. Spirals adorn Childress  victims and one is scarred into his own flesh just below the nape of his neck   a location that means someone else had to have carved the shape into his body   to say nothing of the spiral-ish labyrinth that hosts his final showdown with our heroes. If the dominant geometry of human history and experience is Rust s  flat circle    where everything repeats, where free will is an illusion, where humanity marches witlessly around some sort of existential grindstone   then fighting crime and catching bad guys and mourning our long-dead toddlers is all pointless playacting.
The spiral, on the other hand, makes for a more hopeful metaphor for existence. Whether they collapse inward or wind outward from their centers, spirals suggest progress from one state to another, implying an uncertain future that can be influenced by present action. The intoxicating nihilism of Rust s  flat circle  speech and the abstract brutality of the largely-unseen cultists for whom the spiral is a unifying symbol suggest there s only one assessment of which notion of human existence is right and which is evil.
By converting Rust from a despairing advocate of circular history to a reluctant adherent to the heartening, spiraling idea that light has been bringing the universe closer and closer to a tie ballgame, True Detective reverses its original stance on this symbolic stand-in for philosophical inquiry.
We know the symbolic reversal of that moral binary matters a great deal, since symbolism is so essential to how True Detective works. The show is rampant with the stuff, and its leads are walking symbols of diametrically opposed values systems. The DNA of each man s worldview is on hardly-veiled display in their very names.  Rust Cohle,  the corrosive and elemental force of brute rationalism, rendering life s mysteries into plain inevitabilities of time and force, in the same way the earth s internal forces turn carbon into coal.  Marty Hart,  whose gut goes slack in retirement, the heart-driven man who turns into Fat Marty, Mardi Gras, the guiltless intuiter and womanizer who s good with people and great at the version of grade-school show-and-tell that adults call happy hour. Here, too, Pizzolatto organizes his clearest symbolic language within a binary structure, while also choosing one that is marked by classic cultural ideas of manhood and its rightful place in society.
More broadly, binaries are easy for an audience, and here they created a very engaging playground. But binaries are also simplistic and deceptive. The masculine binary that animates True Detective crowded out a lot of the shadowy complexity that attends real-world institutional conspiracies around power, murder, and sex. It also seems to flatter some classic cultural notions about strong, tough, brooding men being both rightful arbiters of good and evil and sufficient protection from the latter.
In choosing to locate his story within the Rust-Marty dynamic, Pizzolatto foreclosed a great many possibilities including that of female characters who are fully human or who demonstrate agency outside of how their lives collide with the menfolk they orbit. The space Pizzolatto clears with his choices gets allocated to spooky atmospherics and layers of conspiracy that implicate the most powerful political and religious figures in True Detective s Louisiana in a drug-fueled ritual-based murder and pedophilia cult cobbled together from scraps of mainline Christianity and transgressive literary traditions. Other shows that handle similar subject matter have made very different choices about how to approach incest and violence against women and provoked very different kinds of contemplation. Taken together, art like Top of the Lake and The Fall and August: Osage County and True Detective serve as patches in a quilt of ideas about those subjects.
Some of those patches approach this material with a sure and settled viewpoint and find the right characters to bring that viewpoint to fierce and even triumphant life. Others function more as mirrors than as declarations, and I d argue True Detective is one of these. Those old, flawed ideas about hard men keeping us as safe as we are docile and loyal that Rust represents? The show s resolution calls all of them into question, as they fail to net any of the powerful men and institutions that were participating in the Carcosa cult and settle for destroying only its most prolific member. Those binary notions of how we should be and how we should view our species and our place in space-time get dislodged by the show s conclusion. It isn t that the spirals vs. circles, Marty vs. Rust, good vs. evil dynamics get resolved in surprising ways, it s that they prove irresolvable and false by the time it s all over. Rather than endorsing one or another clear or doctrinaire worldview or conception of reality, True Detective suggests its best to lean on a pastiche of many different elements, in much the same way that Adam Gopnik recently argued that the rump plurality of non-atheist non-religious people have set out to do for themselves in defiance of the self-appointed authority of both Pope Francis and Richard Dawkins alike.
 This world is a veil,  the revival-tent preacher with the Elvis haircut says in one early-season episode. As it turns out, that idea is a better representation of what True Detective has to say about human nature than anything. The spirals and circles, crowns and Yellow Kings, philosophizers and affable broskis are all feints at an orderliness that the real world never actually exhibits on its own. We think we re making sense of the world around us, but we ve made it into a veil that is legible to high-functioning animal neurology built to identify important patterns or to create them where none exist. The questions we think are worth asking and the binaries that seem worth organizing your life around prove useless.

*** Spoiler Warning***
 I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution,  Mathew McConaughey s Rust Cohle said during the first episode of  True Detective  but by the end of the series his philosophy reworked itself and reached a moment of contented acceptance.
 Once there was only dark,  he said before the series came to a close.  If you ask me, the light is winning. 
 True Detective  is HBO s newest addition to the long list of shows you have to see because enough people around you have raved about it. And like most shows on that list, it s worth it. The series tells of two Louisianan detectives (McConaughey s Cohle and Woody Harrelson s Marty Hart) who spend 17 years working a case involving murder, Satanism and the deranged. The final episode aired last night. Like all good finales it completed the story and left each viewer the task of piecing it all together for themselves.
Cohle and Hart spent the series tracking and searching for a disturbed mass murderer of women and children. Grotesque, gothic symbols of flat circles and crowns appeared throughout their case that created a complex and dark labyrinth for both detectives.
Parallel to this story of psycho crime is the journey of each man as he battles his demons of regret and pain. For Cohle, his daughter s death and the acceptance of living alongside life s darkness acted as the basis of his troubles while Hart struggled with allowing himself to be vulnerable and loving with his family. Both men s baggage were prominent plot points in  True Detective  but these were never the reasons why you were told to watch along.
The show played a smooth bait and switch where incredible six-minute tracking shot sequences and mysterious horrors snatched our attention while the crux of the story was truly about two different men coming to terms with themselves.
What made  True Detective  stand out from other crime shows and whodunit scenarios is the way it kept it simple while persuading the audience to participate like a Sherlock on a sofa. There weren t any major plot twists or  Don t Stop Believing -induced confusions in the finale. Instead we watched Cohle and Hart reach a fulfilled ending. Hart cries with his ex-wife and children, finally allowing himself to be honest and powerless among them and Cohle embraces the true love he had for his deceased daughter establishing substance in his hollow life. It s a simple but gratifying ending.

The effectiveness and overall impact of HBO s  True Detective  -- the first-arc finale of which proved such a draw last night that it crashed HBO Go -- should be a signal to the television industry that there is success to be had in exploring new programming models. Audiences seem less interested in prolonged seasons of any series, especially when they are presented with perpetual preemptions, or in fall and spring seasons with a prolonged break in between. That break is an annoyance that stalls the momentum a show may have built up from September through December or January before the annual scheduling challenges begin.
That wasn t a problem for  True Detective,  episodes of which premiered at 9 p.m. ET in mid-January and ran on eight Sundays with only one interruption (to avoid the Super Bowl) but otherwise without concern about such competitive programming blockbusters as the Grammy Awards, the Academy Awards or AMC s  The Walking Dead.  HBO made one of the smartest scheduling moves in recent memory, running a drama series starring Matthew McConaughey right through an awards season punctuated by his many nominations for his role in the theatrical film  Dallas Buyers Club,  not to mention the added benefit of all the interviews and press opportunities that resulted from all the actual awards he received. (I suspect he ll pick up a couple more for  True Detective. )

This show ran for only eight episodes -- but they had a running time of approximately one hour each, which roughly equals ten episodes of a broadcast or basic cable series when factoring in time lost to commercial pods. That was just enough to build and maintain interest without the show becoming a chore to stay with, as sometimes happens with even the best series. It also made for easy catch-ups during the season and for comfortable aftermath binges. Eight hours might kill one day, but it won t destroy a weekend. To look at it another way, with its episodes strung together the first arc of  True Detective  could be thought of as an eight-hour movie.
Regardless, series formats and models are suddenly in play as never before. One can forgive anybody who is feeling a sense of confusion about the issue. Perhaps this guide will help, especially as the Upfront season approaches and dozens of networks suddenly dump hundreds of new programs of many kinds into a massive heap that advertisers and critics are supposed to process with unlimited interest. (That worked in the old days of a three- or four-network Upfront, but now May has a madness all its own.)
A mini-series has always been -- and should continue to be -- a one-time closed-ended series that plays over several consecutive nights or weeks. Sundance s  Top of the Lake  and BBC America s  Fleming  are perfect recent examples, even if they were considerably shorter than such legendary miniseries of the past as  Rich Man, Poor Man,   Roots  and  North and South. 
 True Detective  and FX s  American Horror Story  are looked upon as mini-series simply because that is the most convenient definition, and I suppose it fits. But each season of  AHS  continues to build an over-arching brand, as I m certain future seasons of  Detective  will also do. I think these are the true  event  series of our time, rather than mere  minis,  because the return of the brand each year does qualify as something new and special.
Ongoing broadcast series that are scheduled outside of the traditional broadcast season -- like CBS   Under the Dome  and  Extant  and Fox s upcoming  24: Live Another Day  -- are currently being referred to as  event  series. But as long as they continue season to season with the same characters and continuous story lines they should be regarded as  regular  series --  as they would be on basic and pay cable -- and nothing more. (I haven t seen it, but I m already thinking of  Live Another Day  as a ninth season of  24,  rather than some kind of stand-alone  event,  even if it is only twelve episodes, a dramatic departure from its past model -- which, we shouldn t forget, had gotten stale).
 Regular  series continue to be reshaped and rescheduled in all kinds of ways. I consider BBC America s superb back-from-the-dead drama  In the Flesh  to be a regular series, because it has seasons that continue the same story lines with the same characters. It matters not that the first season was only three episodes long (which, minus commercial time, comes out to one longish theatrical movie). The same is true of BBC America s  Broadchurch  and Sundance s  The Returned  (a French import) with their eight-episode cycles of ongoing stories or new stories with ongoing characters.
Streaming series like  House of Cards  and  Orange is the New Black  are  regular  series masquerading as  events  because that s exactly what they are for most people who adjust their lives around them to consume them in their entirety as quickly as possible. So, for now anyway, Netflix gets to have it both ways. I suppose it can be argued that any series anywhere can be gobbled up in so hurried a manner, making anything a potential event, but that s not the intent of the original scheduling, which still counts for something, or ought to. I don t think networks are ready to concede that their first-run prime-time real estate is nothing more than a shelf on which to display fresh product intended to be enjoyed at some non-specific future time, like DVDs on a shelf at Target or anything in a Netflix queue.

Talk
This morning, a dull, gray dawn broke on a dull, gray   True Detective  -less world. The show that has had us gripped for the last eight weeks (or the last weekend for compulsive binge watchers hi there!) came to an end in either a blaze of HBOGO-crashing glory, or a fizzle of HBOGO-crashing disappointment, depending on your point of view. We re much more in the former camp than the latter, so much so that we found our usual Good vs. Bad approach wanting this time around, purely because after a couple of niggles we were really reaching for anything particularly bad to say about it. 
Not to sound uncritical, folks, but with only a few holdouts, we loved this show to distraction, so we re simply going to jot down a few thoughts about the finale (which you can refresh your memory on with the last of our Kevin Jagernauth s excellent recaps here ) prior to looking ahead to season 2. This is a finale post, so do we really have to say there will be spoilers? There will be spoilers.
Thoughts on the finale
Scope of the mystery
We suppose the biggest issue that some might have regarding the finale is that the solution to the mystery is smaller, and some might say, safer than a lot of the speculation had suggested it might be. And it ends with the death of a single man a terrifyingly fucked up, grotesque and insane man, but one not possessed by supernatural forces, or even gifted particular powers, with other major players in the catalogue of sick crimes still at large. But that was to us a source of great relief too a cool debunking of the kind of referential mania that had set in where every single thing had Significance and Meaning and it all pointed to some impossibly complex and tortuous, potentially otherworldly conclusion in favor of something real-world, making it more enriching.
In fact, we could go so far as to say it s the show s most successful bait-and-switch; just think about how all those  clues  (Audrey s childhood sex drawings are maybe the best example) made us think about the relationships differently, even though they ultimately had no bearing on the mystery. Because this is a murder mystery show that is not about whodunnit, it s about who solved it it is about Cohle and Hart: their characters, their souls, and of course, their weird dynamic. By returning to that throughline for the finale, where some see the  safe  choice, we see the choice that was the bravest of all staying true to these characters and not tumbling down the rabbit hole of endless overplotting.
Resolution to Cohle and Hart s relationship
We might almost be tempted to chalk the  they become friends in the end  arc of Cohle and Hart s relationship into the negative column, for a show that did so much differently to what we ve come to expect. But damned if it didn t do it so well that every moment between them in the hospital and beyond felt right, and earned and satisfying. And it culminated in that twinkle of uncharacteristic hope from Cohle ( the light s winning ) that, whether it s an homage to or a rip off from Alan Moore or not, feels like it made the whole journey worthwhile.
The climactic chase through the twiggy tunnels
We have to shout out this sequence, because despite the points we ve made above about it really being the story of a relationship and not the gothic horror blah blah blah, the show could do gothic horror really well too. And never better than here, in what has to be its tensest and most genuinely frightening scene. The fact that this late in the game it was still convincingly toying with the idea that there might be something truly uncanny and unkillable at the root of all this evil, and that it sustains that mood of dread so brilliantly, is a triumph of directorial vision and control and set design, because, sheesh. That it all then culminates in a vision of a black hole which we retrospectively theorize could be the beginning of the hallucinatory trip that will bring a near-dead Cohle to his daughter (or an unholy confluence of Internet theories so fucking horrible they broke the space/time continuum to enter the show and distract him at nearly the cost of his life), is something that only a show this controlled in its craziness could ever have possibly gotten away with.
What now for season 2? 
A great deal has already been written about what won t be returning in season 2: no McConaughey/Cohle, no Harrelson/Hart, no Louisiana, no Cary Fukunaga (or single director, multiple helmers will likely take over ), no canary-colored royalty. All of these elements together seem to constitute so much of what made the show great that we are forced to ask, what s left? What can creator/writer Nic Pizzolatto possibly bring to season 2 that will make it not just as good as, but even recognizably the same show? With the writer himself teasing at this very early stage that season 2 will be about  hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system  here are the elements of season 1 that we really hope to see retained in what is clearly going to be a totally different story.
Lying, storytelling and  truth 
Director Cary Fukunaga was himself quick to tell us last year that the title  True Detective  was  not my choice,  and with the pulpy, tabloid-sensationalist feel it initially gave to a show that turned out to be much more intelligent and elegiac, safe to say we weren t always fans either. But as the episodes progressed and more of the flashback/interview structure became discernible, we slightly changed our minds on that, and began to think it appropriate that there was some reference to truth in its title. Particularly exemplified by the sequence, which contains the already famous six-minute tracking shot of Cohle and the bikers, which is never related to the interviewing detectives (Cohle and Hart stick to the story that he went to visit his father), as well as, of course, their  heroic  moment which is narrated in such a way that their cover story plays over what actually happened, the show constantly played with the idea of truth, counterpointing it with cover-ups and lies. And it wasn t just narrative tricksiness: again it was always revealing about the characters and their sometimes almost symbiotic relationships, and also their constructed and occasionally hypocritical ideas of themselves (viz Hart s  all for the family  rationalization playing over scenes of him cheating). We d love to see this level of thought-provoking counterpoint and storytelling inventiveness return (though obviously not in the a carbon-copy interview format), and with the job of detecting in general being about trying to  find the truth  and  construct a narrative  we can t see why it wouldn t.
A Different kind of cop-partner relationship
Obviously the cop-pair dynamic is one we ve seen onscreen about sixteen billion times, and one of the pleasures of  True Detective  was that, until the very last episode at least, it had largely subverted all available archetypes. There was a prickliness in their relationship from the start, borne of totally different worldviews and philosophies (not just the old by-the-book guy meets maverick cliche), and if each man eventually made the other a better version of himself, Christ, was that wisdom ever hard-won and unpleasant to come by. There s still quite some mileage in the idea that the guy (or woman) who has your back is also the person best placed to betray or manipulate you, and we hope this ambivalence finds its place in season 2.
Sense of place
If we won t be returning to the lived-in Louisiana of season 1, and if in fact we can read some sort of national, or at least less parochial, scale into Pizzolatto s comment about season 2 being about  the secret occult history of the United States transportation system,  we hope that won t lessen the authenticity of the locations and the environments. The sense of an ancient place where family trees were as twisted and gnarled as those sinister twig sculptures, and where evil could lurk swamp-deep, and where even ordinary people could be genteel yet corrupt, was one of the great achievements of this show. And while any new setting will bring with it other characteristics, we hope as much time is invested in creating similar depth.
Cinematography, production design, craft
Season 1 looked amazing. There s the shotmaking, courtesy of Fukunaga and cinematographer Adam Arkapaw (also DP on  Top of the Lake ), from the bravura six-minute tracking shot, to the taillight shot a personal favorite to the tiara timelapse to Cohle in a shaft of sunlight in the creepy abandoned school and so on. And there are the incredibly intricate props and sets from production designer Alex DiGerlando, which you can read more about in this great Vulture piece (they built the burnt church they built the church.) But with Fukunaga mentioning that just as he wouldn t be returning as director for season 2, his collaborators might not be either (by reason of exhaustion), it s possible that many of the people who made season 1 so unforgettably beautiful to look at might not automatically be back to lend their insane talents next time out. Not that they ll have trouble finding people clamoring to be associated with what is now a smash hit, but still, we can t help but feel season 2 has a lot of living up to do, on a craft level, to season 1 s high watermark.
Music
Similarly, the music throughout was pretty extraordinary ( listen to it all again here ), from the opening track that has haunted our every waking moment since we started watching and that made this probably the only show for which we ve never fast-forwarded through the openings credits (also: credit design shout-out especially for the Woody/highways bit). Episode 4,  Who Goes There,  is probably the one that sticks most in mind at the moment on this level, for containing both this writer s least favorite music cue of the season (the Grinderman track) and my most favorite (Lucinda Williams   Are You Alright? ), but in general this was peerless soundtracking, evocative and resonant and totally on theme throughout. More, please.
And one final thing we d like to see that we perhaps did not get enough of first time out:
More central roles for women
There is a criticism that the show s women were underserved, and certainly their screen time is relatively minimal. We d argue that was a side effect of those characters simply not being the focus of a story which was as much a depiction, and a very critical one, of socially-constructed masculinity in a very male-skewed profession and milieu, as anything else. And in fact, even with the lesser screen time, their characters had more agency than many lead female roles in other TV procedurals (with the eternal exception of the terrific  Top of the Lake ). But we d certainly be happy to see women in more foregrounded roles next time out, because if Pizzolatto writes them with anything like the insight and inspiration that went into Cohle and Hart, he could address those criticisms and differentiate season 2 from the very outset. And it seems we might be in luck, as Pizzolatto not only mentions  hard women  in his summation of season 2, he did once tweet ( since deleted ) in response to a comment in this arena:  One of the detriments of only having two POV characters, both men (a structural necessity). Next season  
One boon for Pizzolatto and any future  True Detective  director on this and any other casting/crewing decision they have to make, is that we can t imagine, after the blistering success of season 1, that they won t have their pick of the crop when it comes to season 2. And with that, here we are at the end and we have to face the eerie void that is a year or so without any more  True Detective,  taking comfort only in Cohle s assertion that  Nothing is ever over.  Talk us through the grief, or share your thoughts on where you want the show to go, below.

So it turns out this live streaming of popular TV programs is harder than it looks.
 Watch now?  True Detective fans said through gritted teeth.  Why, I d love to. 
Viewers who opted to watch Sunday night s finale of True Detective via HBO Go, the pay channel s streaming app, were treated to the kind of shocking twist they probably could have done without: The streaming service went belly up shortly after the final episode began airing at 9 p.m. ET.
And the reason you couldn t watch True Detective on HBO Go Sunday night? According to HBO, it s because too many of you were trying to watch True Detective at the same time.
Due to overwhelmingly popular demand for #TrueDetective , we've been made aware of an issue affecting some users. Please try again soon.
&mdash; HBO GO (@HBOGO) March 10, 2014
To watch HBO Go, whether it s viewing new episodes as they premiere or combing through the back catalog of HBO original programming, you ve got to subscribe to the pay cable service in theory. In practice, if you borrow the login information of a willing accomplice, you can watch HBO Go to your heart s content. And you know what? HBO really isn t going to stress about that .
Paying customers, however, may feel differently after Sunday night s streaming snafu. An article on Hypable (which I spotted thanks to the Washington Post ) wonders if it s not time for HBO to start tightening up the rules for its streaming app, which is available on mobile platforms as well as set-top boxes and gaming consoles. Specifically, the Hypable article suggests that HBO think about restricting the number of people who can log into any one HBO Go account at a given time. After all, this is the second high-profile season finale where HBO GO went belly up last year s Game of Thrones season-ender suffered similar issues.
It s also the second consecutive weekend in which your plans to stream a popular television broadcast may have gone awry. If you thought finding out the identity of the Yellow King was complicated, you should have tried streaming last week s Oscar ceremony. Despite limiting the first-ever Oscar live stream to a handful of markets, ABC couldn t deliver the telecast to viewers tuning in on mobile devices. The circumstances behind the Academy Awards and True Detective streaming failures are very different, of course, but both incidents go to show that traditional broadcasters are going to have to put in a lot more effort before streaming becomes as seamless as simply pressing the power button on your TV remote.
HBO did have some good news on Monday, though:
The issues affecting HBO GO last night have been resolved. Thank you for being patient.

So consider those barn doors securely closed, even if the horses are several counties away binge-watching Girls.

Which Pulpy Genre Should True Detective Plunder for Season Two?
What matters about True Detective season two isn t so much the plot or the cast it s the genre. Season one won the internet s attention partly through its heady plumbing of Lovecraftian mythos and blending it with Southern Gothicism. There s no use trying to repeat that formula, so where else can the show turn to capture lightning in a bottle?

.
So, early reports (i.e. this interview ) suggest that season two of True Detective is going to be about  hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the U.S. transportation system.  Whatever that means. Ghost trains? Devil-worshipping conductors? The satanically slow speeds on Amtrak? We ll leave Nic Pizzolatto to his scripting, but in our eyes, what matters about True Detective season two isn t so much the plot or the cast it s the genre. Season one captured the internet s attention partly through its heady plumbing of Lovecraftian mythos and blending it with Southern Gothicism. There s no use trying to repeat that formula, so where else can the show turn to capture lightning in a bottle?
Idea one:  70s conspiracy-theory thriller
Season one had a grand, governmental conspiracy weaved into its plot. Police reports were altered, Louisiana s Senator was implicated, Rust Cohle was always fighting the system in one way or another. But as the show wound towards its conclusion, the big-picture stuff mostly fell away, and we were left with our two heroes going up against Errol in Carcosa. That s fine, but why not go full Parallax View next time? Set it wherever you want Washington, City Hall, some backwater town in Alaska. Get twisty and convoluted, but with that edgy, almost psychedelic element of madness that should come with any paranoia-based thriller. It really just sounds like I m asking for HBO to produce season two of Rubicon. Well, that s fine by me.
Idea two: Classic Poe
The Following did its best to ruin Edgar Allen Poe for everyone by having its chief villain, Joe Carroll, worship the macabre author and base a cult around his writing. His acolytes wandered around in Poe masks setting people on fire, and then Kevin Bacon would show up, point at a crime scene, and say,  Classic Poe.  This offense must be corrected, and while I m sure Pizzolatto will feel the topic is overplayed, I wish he d step in to draw from Poe s writing in a much more thematically appropriate matter. The man wrote some of the earliest detective fiction, after all, and had the sense of atmosphere that proved so crucial to True Detective s first season.
Idea three: The Wicker Man (but, y know, good)
Season one of True Detective revolved around a Satanic Voodoo cult. What if next year we just go full pagan? The original 1973 Wicker Man is a deceptively creepy, shattering horror story disguised as a mystery, with a policeman investigating the disappearance of a girl on a remote British island. A bunch of no-good sex druids immediately start making trouble. It all sounds silly, and Neil LaBute s horrendous Nicolas Cage-starring remake didn t help that reputation, but there is something genuinely frightening and fascinating about being stuck on an island in the middle of nowhere. As long as there s no Smoke Monster.
Idea four: Cyberpunk
Alright, this is as far-fetched as it gets. But a man can dream. If you really want to shake things up, nothing s further from Carcosa than cyberspace, and there s plenty of philosophical debate to plunder from the works of William Gibson or Neal Stephenson. Matthew McConaughey is coasting to a career revival partly on the back of True Detective maybe it s time for Keanu Reeves to enjoy the same renaissance? I look forward to much talk of  jacking in  and the  Metaverse.  Who am I kidding, there s more of a chance that season two just ends up being about Rust Cohle and Marty Walsh chasing tail in an old folks home.

What s going on with  True Detective  Season 2?
HBO hasn't officially ordered it yet, but the show creator has outlined some vague plans for the next season

It s rare for a television show   especially a drama that becomes a hit in its first season   to totally scrap its existing characters and story line to start anew in Season 2. But that s what  True Detective  is doing   at least, that is what it seems to be doing, based on the few clues that show creator Nic Pizzolatto has shared with television critics in recent interviews.
HitFix s Alan Sepinwall notes that HBO hasn t officially ordered Season 2
yet   again, a stalling that s rare for a hit series so popular that it brings down its hosts site   but surmises that this is  because I suspect HBO is waiting until they ve signed the actors they want before announcing. 
There are a few things we do know about Season 2 of  True Detective,  however: Pizzolatto is currently  fleshing it out,  he told EW , and it will be about  hard women, bad men and the secret occult history of the United States transportation system. 
And the Chicago Tribune claims that Matthew McConaughey, who played detective Rust Cohle alongside Woody Harrelson as Marty Hart, won t be back:
The show was always intended as an anthology with a new story each season. The surprise survival of both Rust Cohle and Marty Hart at the end of Season 1 suggested at least one could return, someday. But McConaughey has said he never planned to stay beyond one season.  It was a 450-page film, is what it was,  McConaughey said of the show s first season during a January Television Critics Association panel.   It was also finite. It didn t mean we had to come back this year, next year if we were under contract. It was finite. So in that way it was exactly a 450-page film script. 
Cohle and Hart are probably not coming back, but Pizzolatto has retained the literary rights to his protagonists.  So maybe you will see Cohle and Hart novels down the road after Hollywood kicks me out. Always a possibility,  he told EW.
And it s not just the cast and story that will change   the entire directorial style, overseen in Season 1 by Cary Fukunaga, is likely to change, too. Pizzolatto told BuzzFeed via email:
We don t have any plans to work with one director again. It would be impossible to do this yearly as we need to be able to do post while we re still filming, like any other show. There s some great guys I ve consulted, and we re all confident we can achieve the same consistency. Going forward, I want the show s aesthetic to remain determinedly naturalistic, with room for silences and vastness, and an emphasis on landscape and culture. And I hope a story that presents new characters in a new place with authenticity and resonance and an authorial voice consistent with this season. Dominant colors will change. South Louisiana was green and burnished gold.
It seems like the freshman show is already being gutted, left with skeletal remains that, once filled in again, might not even resemble its original form. One thing that we do know about Season 1 that will carry over from season 2   perhaps the most important thing   is that the philosophical detective drama will continue with the same spirit    keep being strange. 
 Don t play the next one straight,  Pizzolatto told HitFix.

TV Ratings: 'True Detective' Finale Scores Series High
Lacey Terrell/HBO
UPDATED: The anthology closes out its first season as the network's most-watched freshman since "Six Feet Under" in 2001.
Whoever signs on to star in the very likely second season of True Detective has big shoes to fill.
The anthology's freshman finale, which brought an end to the story of Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey's 17-year murder case, brought in a series high 3.5 million viewers on Sunday night. That's up 50 percent from the premiere just two months ago.
What's more, the latest gross viewership for the show has an average 11 million viewers tuning in every week. When final DVR and HBO Go views are taken into account, that number stands to grow even more. It already ranks as the most-watched freshman series HBO has had since Six Feet Under in 2001.
PHOTOS: Matthew McConaughey and more of THR's Rule Breakers
Sunday's HBO Go crash is evident of widespread interest in the series, particularly from multi-platform viewers. The streaming service briefly shut down on Sunday night after the episode went live. "Due to overwhelming interest in the season finale of True Detective, HBO Go was hit with an excessive amount of traffic soon after 9 p.m. ET last night," read a network statement. "The issue has since been rectified and the service is now back to normal."
On TV, live-plus-same day returns for True Detective grew even more with an encore. Across plays, the finale brought in 4.9 million viewers -- also a high.
True Detective hasn't officially been renewed for a sophomore season, but it is very much in the cards. The strong ratings and critical buzz quickly led to an overall deal for creator-writer Nic Pizzolatto. An anthology series, True Detective would return with a new cast and new story.

# Comments
In the end, the naysayers who accused  HBO s  True Detective   of being sexist seem mostly irrelevant. Yes, it would be nice to see more top-notch hour-long dramas created by women and concerning women, particularly more women of color. But that s not what  True Detective  was intended to do.
At its heart, this was a story of male friendship, transcending macho rivalry and frat boy cavorting to ultimately be about guys saving each other.
A mystery wrapped in a religious cult conspiracy, slowly unfolded by two antiheroes   one a lying adulterer, the other an addict with pretentious theories about the meaning of life   ultimately was a male drama. The mission involved saving little girls, balancing the loss of one of the detective s little girl. But women didn t figure in, except as a plot twist to establish the two detectives  antipathy.
Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey deserve applause, the creepy littered overgrown and horrific compound where the endgame played out deserves a nod for set design; T Bone Burnett deserves praise for the moody, even otherworldly music. But storywise, the eight episodes of this anthology series involved too many leaps and loopholes. The misdirection concerning the suspected pedophile priest, the Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle, was just confusing. How did he die? What did it matter?

Much of the gumshoes  discovery happened by luck and chance rather than logic. Green ears? Green paint? A painter! The sudden rush of clues, leading neatly to the serial killer via work permits and job orders via computer, felt a bit pat after all the soul-searching, existential doubt and flashback interviewing.
The final scenes, with McConaughey dressed, positioned and coiffed to look like Jesus Christ, suggested more profundity than the show actually offered. Looking to the night sky for cosmic truths, Hart (Harrelson) and Cohle (McConaughey) again slip away from the authority figures (this time, it s the hospital) to go it alone. Together.
It s all about good versus evil, light versus dark, Cohle concluded, and  the light s winning. 
Moody, unnerving, confusing   but surprisingly optimistic.
HBO Go crash
Meanwhile, the light may have been ascendant, but the electrons weren t cooperating: The HBO Go streaming service collapsed, unable to feed demand for the finale Sunday. The network promptly scheduled a rerun, and the service on HBO cable was unaffected. The twitterverse had a field day (sample tweet:  Congratulations to #TrueDetective for being the first show to literally break @HBOGO ).

Sentient meat never smelled so sweet: True Detective ended its first season with its best-yet ratings, attracting 3.5 million TV viewers to its 9 p.m. finale. That s an increase of more than 50 percent from the show s January premiere, which pulled in 2.3 million viewers. But while that number is great in and of itself, it only hints at how successful True D has been for HBO. If you fold in folks who watched one of two reruns of the show last night, viewership jumps up to 4.9 million. And looking at the show s entire eight-episode run, HBO estimates that roughly 11 million viewers on average have watched each episode of the show, once you tally up various replays, DVR recordings, and folks who watch via HBO GO (assuming they can log on to the service). That number makes True D HBO s most-watched first-year series since Six Feet Under s freshman year in 2001.
Elsewhere in the Sunday ratings, ABC was actually the night s biggest winner, thanks to a shockingly good debut for its heavily hyped new drama Resurrection. Episode one of the limited series attracted 13.3 million viewers and earned a 3.6 rating among viewers under 50 at 9 p.m.   numbers ABC hasn t seen for a series in that time slot since 2010. Even more impressive: ABC's undead people beat The Walking Dead, which averaged 12.7 million viewers for AMC. (The zombies still crushed all among viewers under 50.) Resurrection's debut was a much-needed boost for the Alphabet, which has launched a series of Nielsen drama duds in recent months (Betrayal, Killer Women, Mind Games, et al.).
The spiritual themes of Resurrection also trumped the hard science of Cosmos: Fox s remake of the Carl Sagan classic debuted to an okay-but-not-great 5.8 million viewers on the Fox network, as well as a slightly better 2.1 rating among adult viewers under 50. The debut episode aired on nine of Fox s sister nets (including FX and National Geographic Channel), and once those numbers are included, Cosmos jumps up to 8.5 million viewers.  One last note: Not many folks bothered to watch Lindsay Lohan's new reality show on OWN. The premiere of Lindsay earned just 693,000 viewers Sunday, which is below even the so-so 900,000 viewers or so Oprah Winfrey's interview with Lohan notched last August.

CBS's Norah O'Donnell to Al Franken: 'It's Great to See You in the United States Senate'
By Scott Whitlock | March 10, 2014 | 4:05 PM EDT

shares
CBS This Morning co-host Norah O'Donnell on Monday gushed over comedian turned Democratic Senator Al Franken. With no pretense, she told the liberal politician, "...It's great to see you in the United States Senate. But, you know, we all remember you from Saturday Night Live." [See video below. MP3 audio here .] "We grew up" watching you, the journalist added. 
Franken was given five and a half minutes of air time to talk about his thoughts on a potential merger between cable giants Comcast and Time Warner. Yet, O'Donnell still found time for breezy questions such as asking, "Do you go back at all to watch SNL?... Don't we need more humor in the United States Congress?"
Earlier in the segment, guest co-host Anthony Mason brought up the subject of data collection and privacy. He questioned,  "Should the government be looking at regulating what's happening with this information?" 
Yet nowhere in the segment did Mason, O'Donnell or co-host Gayle King mention Barack Obama. Considering that Franken's party controls the Senate and the White House, it might make sense to question Democratic culpability related to NSA spying and other examples of data collection. 
On the subject of the Comcast/Time Warner merger, O'Donnell offered very basic, generic questions: "Can you block this merger?" 
A partial transcript of the March 10 CBS This Morning segment is below: 
NORAH O'DONNELL: Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken is with us this morning. He sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee and .later this month that group will hold hearings on the proposed merger by Comcast and Time Warner Cable. The $45 billion deal would give Comcast subscribers in 43 of the nation's top 50 markets. That's about 30 percent of paid TV customers. Senator Franken, good morning. 
AL FRANKEN: Good morning. 
O'DONNELL: Can you block this merger? 
FRANKEN: Well, I can't block it. It would be up to the regulators. But I wrote them when I heard about this immediately and expressed my concerns, which is that this will be bad for consumers of TV, cable TV and the internet. Comcast is the number one provider of cable TV, the number one provider of the internet. Time Warner is the number two provider of cable TV and the number three provider of internet. And I think this will be -- I think consumers will end up paying more. There will be less competition. There will be less innovation and worse, even worse service. 
...
MASON: You mentioned the internet. Both of these companies provide internet service. 60 Minutes did a report last night about how much inform something's being harvested from consumers all over America. Should the government be looking at regulating what's happening with this information? 
FRANKEN: Yeah. Well, I've been looking at it. I'm chairman of the Privacy, Technology, and the Law Subcommittee and there's a lot of disturbing stuff up there. You saw it last night on 60 Minutes. I really believe that Americans have a right to privacy, that they have a right to know what's being taken, what of their private information something's being taken, and to give permission. If they're going to take their private information such as your location information, that says where you go to the doctor, where you drop your kids off at school, where you live, where you work, what you do. Last night's 60 Minutes story was a very good one. I urge you to -- that's on CBS, isn't it? 
KING: Yes, Senator, it is. 
FRANKEN: So, I have a piece of legislation I'll be reintroducing. It passed last Congress in the Senate committee. 
O'DONNELL: And Senator, can I just say, you know, it's great to see you in the United States Senate. But, you know, we all remember you from Saturday Night Live. We all grew up --
FRANKEN: Thanks for remembering. 
O'DONNELL: Do you still go back at all?
FRANKEN: Do I what? 
O'DONNELL: Go back at all to watch SNL? 
FRANKEN: I watch the show. I'm a big fan of the show. It's   you know   I think we're in our 39th year. The show's in its 39th year.  
O'DONNELL: Don't we need more humor in the United States Congress? 
FRANKEN: No. 
KING: Well, some would say mission accomplished then. 
FRANKEN: See? Very good. See who's funny here? [Pointing to Gayle.]

Charter CEO Working to Reduce 'Cable Guy' Visits
1:00 PM PDT 3/10/2014 by Paul Bond
Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images
Tom Rutledge
Tom Rutledge also says he is "observing" the Comcast takeover of Time Warner Cable but adds, "We don't need M&A to be a successful company."
Tom Rutledge is no fan of multiple visits from the "cable guy," he said during a conversation at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet and Telecom Conference in Florida on Monday.
The Charter Communications CEO said he is working hard to minimize the need to roll out personnel and trucks to customers because "getting that out of the business" improves the quality of the product. One way Charter is accomplishing that is by selling triple-play services so that multiple products can be installed with a single visit and fewer "transactions."
STORY: Charter CEO Still Up for 'Wisely Acquiring' Subs After Comcast-TW Cable Deal
"Taking transactions out of the business actually increases customer satisfaction," Rutledge said. "The opportunity for things to go wrong are legendary. I mean, people make movies about it -- Cable Guy. Getting that out of the business dramatically improves satisfaction."
Rutledge also talked about "a whole bunch of opportunities" for Charter and other cable companies that will come by way of looming 10-gigabyte-per-second Internet speeds and wireless Internet connections in every home.
"We'll have the ability to probably do something along the lines of a 'wireless drop,' meaning a wireless connection for every household, which might not even require a physical connection between the house and the street," he said.
He said that he does not anticipate that consumers will want to navigate giant TV screens with their fingers the same way they do with iPads and other tablets, therefore Charter is focusing on improving remote controls for such functionality.
Of the impending Comcast acquisition of Time Warner Cable -- a company Charter once coveted -- Rutledge said, "We're observing them." He added, "We don't need M&A to be a successful company."
Charter shares, meanwhile, were rising 1 percent to more than $128 a share on Monday during midday trading. Wall Street analysts have been friendly to the stock lately, and, on Monday, Jefferies Group upgraded shares to "buy" with a $150 price target. On Friday, Northland Capital upgraded the stock to "outperform."

Here s How Comcast Plans to Rule American Cable and Internet
The Comcast Center, Philadelphia. Photo: Matt Rourke/AP
It s been a little more than 100 years since this country witnessed an accumulation of economic power to rival what Comcast is assembling. Like the Gilded Age magnates who controlled oil and refining and leveraged their product with railroads, Comcast, the country s largest cable company, is building a cash-generating machine that controls every aspect of its business.
In the 1890s and early 1900s, the Gilded Age magnates took advantage of the laissez-faire philosophy of the time. Today, even though there are in theory more safeguards, regulations, and guidelines to prevent such industrial consolidation, no one is even suggesting that they be used, certainly not to an extent that will prevent a lot of damage. The prevailing view of what constitutes an abuse of power is too weak   and so are potential protections against such abuse.
Much of the news in the internet world has been taken up by the possible consequences of Comcast s proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable, the second-largest cable system. But the issues extend well beyond this deal. There s also the recent Supreme Court decision that gives Comcast complete control over its TV channel lineup. And there s the news that Netflix has decided to connect its broadband distribution to Comcast, paying for the privilege. Together, they portend a truly frightening future for both television and the internet.
Art Brodsky
About
Art Brodsky is a veteran journalist and advocate in Internet and telecommunications issues. He is now a communications consultant.
Controlling the Channels
Let s start with the cable TV network, the core of Comcast s business and the most pedestrian contrasted with the relative flash of high-speed Internet access. On February 24, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Tennis Channel s final legal gasp on a complaint against Comcast that was filed in 2010. That year, the Tennis Channel went to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and claimed discrimination because Comcast put the channel on a pay tier, where it would have fewer viewers, and thus a lower advertising base, than if it were on basic cable like the Golf Channel, which Comcast owns.
At the FCC, an administrative judge held extensive hearings and decided for Tennis Channel. The relevant FCC bureau held for Tennis Channel. And the Commission itself decided for Tennis Channel. Then Comcast went to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which more often than not takes the opportunity to knock around the FCC. The Appeals Court reversed the FCC, finding that Tennis Channel s placement on a different programming tier wouldn t benefit Comcast. No harm (to Comcast at least), no foul.
There are a couple of lessons to take from the Tennis Channel experience that bear on the bigger picture. First, Comcast now has legal carte blanche to do whatever it wants on its channel lineup, including discriminating against independent programmers. That means if you want to start a channel on the country s biggest cable operator, you may have to agree to some special conditions, maybe even take on Comcast as an  investor. 
Second, the more universal lesson that that small businesses are out there on their own. The government and its laws which exist in theory to protect them are, in practice, useless. Tennis Channel probably spent millions in legal fees, won every round they were supposed to win, and then lost. There is a reason only two complaints have been filed against Comcast. The other was from Bloomberg, which has deeper pockets than Comcast. Bloomberg wants its financial news channel to be put in the same  neighborhood  as other news channels like CNBC and MSNBC, which Comcast owns. Bloomberg thought that the wording of one of the conditions on which Comcast was able to gobble up NBC-Universal required a channel switch immediately. Bloomberg spent millions litigating the word  now  before the FCC agreed with the company , three years after Bloomberg filed its complaint. The matter is now pending in a Federal appeals court
These cases are the reasons that whenever anyone talks about putting conditions on an FCC-approved deal, they are basically wishing out loud. Big companies have more money and lawyers and will make mincemeat out of conditions, throwing more into it than most mortal companies can afford. Conditions only work when they are enforced, which is rarely. Senator Al Franken (D-MN) listed some of the conditions and lack of enforcement in a letter to the FCC. Conditions are window dressing.
Expanding the Empire
Once the channel guide is set, then the question becomes: who will get the service? The answer shows the utter futility of modern anti-trust law. The largest cable company, Comcast, wants to pay $45 billion to buy the second-largest, Time-Warner Cable. The combined company would span 70 million subscribers   about 40 percent of all broadband subscribers and 30 percent or so of cable subscribers   and it would have access to 19 out of the country s top 20 markets, including New York and Los Angeles, where Time Warner is the local cable company. However, the companies don t compete directly because each has its own service territory, and so it would be hard to say there would be lessened competition. That s the argument Comcast executives make to justify the deal.
That s also the theory that allowed telephone companies created after the breakup of AT&T to reassemble most of AT&T in two existing companies, except stronger than the old Ma Bell because of the profit-engine of wireless services. What the theory ignores is the enormous market power of a company with 30 million subscribers stretching across the country. The problem is acute for broadcasters. They have to negotiate terms with cable companies to get their channels on cable systems. When there is an impasse, and there have been many, the cable system simply drops the TV network until there s agreement. With Comcast in all but one of the top markets, its power to force terms on broadcasters will be considerable.  There will be disruptions in ad sales as well.
The  competition  for wired Internet access has been over for a while, as Verizon and Comcast cut a deal. Comcast ditched plans to get into the wireless business and will sell Verizon wireless to customers. Verizon, in areas that don t have FiOS, will recommend Comcast broadband. Will that continue in territories now served by Time Warner that would be gathered into the Comcast empire, like, say, New York City? Say what you will about wireless, it s still not as robust a service as wired broadband services are.
That leads to the last building block.
The Toll Plaza
This is where the deal between Netflix and Comcast comes in. Comcast now will determine which program providers, like Netflix , have the privilege of paying extra to provide content their customers want. Big companies like Netflix, or other video providers, can afford those direct connections.  Smaller, newer services can t, and their growth will suffer.
The timing and the framing of the deal lead to any number of questions, but the conclusions seem fairly clear. First, look at the circumstances. For some reason, in the months prior to the deal, Netflix customers on Comcast and Verizon s networks had been experiencing some very serious service issues .  There can be many reasons for the degradation of picture or more frequent buffering, but remember on basic fact:  consumers have paid for Netflix content twice already.  They (we) pay once for the broadband service and another time for a Netflix subscription.
Every bit that goes over the network has been requested by a customer. This isn t Netflix pushing traffic. It s Netflix responding to customer demand. If you look at it that way, then the  agreement  between Netflix and Comcast becomes a little more interesting. Netflix will pay Comcast an undisclosed amount of money to connect directly to Comcast s network, but Netflix will not get   preferential treatment    from Comcast. On the other hand, it may be that Netflix s service problems will magically improve as a result of the payments to Comcast.
Verizon will be next to charge Netflix for the privilege of delivering movies and TV shows customers wanted.
The End Result
The one company that may truly know what s going on is Cogent, the Internet access carrier which had been carrying Netflix traffic. Cogent CEO Dave Schaeffer has said Comcast and Verizon aren t investing in creating more capacity for exchanging traffic. His larger point, however, is that companies which can t afford to pay whatever Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T want for non-prioritizing direct connections will have their traffic degraded.
If Comcast buys Time Warner, the toll gate gets much larger , encompassing not only Comcast s 22 million customers but Time Warner s eight million (after Comcast ritual of discarding three million) in the largest markets.  As it is, Schaeffer said, Netflix is paying a lot to connect to one cable company.
The sum of those Comcast actions is pretty impressive. They can discriminate among programmers on their cable networks, expand their market of those networks to millions more people, and can charge Internet commerce companies for direct access to their newly enlarged service territory.
Once upon a time, government agencies might have been interested in such things. But with the narrow definitions of anti-trust hobbling the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission having given away (so far) its authority over broadband and Congress more in the thrall of large companies, it s almost a certainty that consumers will get the short end of the stick, again.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Tonight JCPS comes one step closer to the big idea behind a new way of teaching.
The Board of Education expects to name finalists in the School of Innovation competition.
The state has given a handful of school districts special exemption from certain rules and regulations to re-think what education should look like.
It's Kentucky's answer to the charter school.
Twelve semi-finalists presented their ideas last week. One idea creates a magnet school on Museum Row. Another uses art to teach all subjects.
The finalist will be made public at the JCPS board meeting tonight at 7.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Indiana lawmakers could soon have a say in childcare.
A bill being negotiated in the General Assembly Monday would require all child care centers that receive taxpayer money to have nutritional and safety standards.
Limits would also be set on how many children each center could oversee.
These changes come after an unlicensed Indianapolis day care owner faces charges after four children were hospitalized due to Benedryl overdoses.
The bill needs final approval from the House, Senate and Governor before becoming law.

Franken Says He is Against Comcast/TWC  Right Now 
Tells 'CBS This Morning' he thinks Comcast has 'too cozy' of a relationship with regulators
eggerton
Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) continues to hammer the proposed Comcast/Time Warner Cable deal in very public venues, including telling CBS that he has gotten 60,000 responses to an e-mail soliciting input on Comcast cable service and the news for Comcast isn't good.
In an interview with CBS This Morning, a transcript of which the network was sending out to other news outlets Monday, Franken said:  I got 60,000 responses, and believe me, people don t like their service from Comcast, and they don t think this deal is going to help them,  he said.
In a survey posted to Franken's campaign Web site last month (he is running for re-election in the fall), Franken asked for help from consumers in protecting them from "skyrocketing cable rates." The survey asks questions about price and service quality, but also whether they "feel like" they have a choice "when it comes to cable service."
In an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper following the proposed deal's announcement last month, Franken said there needed to be more competition, not less. Asked how that could be achieved, Franken said: "We don't allow the two biggest companies to merge. That's how we have more competition." He quickly added that the Senate needed to look at the deal and that he "had not come down one way or the other."
But in the CBS interview, Franken was asked whether there was anything that would make the deal OK with him, his response was that he was "against this right now, from everything I have seen."
When Norah O'Donnell suggested the deal would probably go through, Franken said he thought there was a "a little bit of a too-cozy relationship between Comcast and the regulators," but did not elaborate. He opposed the Comcast/NBCU deal, which the FCC approved with conditions, though Franken has complained those conditions were not always honored.
An FCC spokesperson declined to comment on the "cozy" characterization.
One not-so cozy relationship Comcast has with the commission was the FCC's finding that Comcast had not complied with the news neighborhooding condition when it came to Bloomberg's business news channel, although Comcast maintains it did not violate that condition.
Comcast declined comment on Franken's latest criticisms, but has said previously that the company is "proud of our track-record on complying with the conditions from our past transactions including NBCUniversal."

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- History is about to be made on the Milton Madison Bridge.
Crews are planning to close the bridge for a week starting on Friday. When that happens, the new half-mile bridge will become the longest bridge in North America -- and likely the world -- to be slid laterally into place.
It could take up to 16 hours to slide the bridge 55 feet on top of the refurbished piers, but then it will take several days to secure it.
Drivers will have to use the Markland Locks and Dam Bridge 26 miles upstream or the Kennedy Bridge in Louisville 46 miles downstream. A ferry will be used to take emergency medical vehicles across the river between Milton and Madison.

"Even before announcing its plans for Time Warner Cable, Comcast had donated to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it," reports Politico here.
"Money from Comcast s political action committee has flowed to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee," including its antitrust subcommittee leaders, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah).
"The cable giant has donated in some way to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is planning a hearing of its own. And Comcast has canvassed the two congressional panels that chiefly regulate cable, broadband and other telecom issues, donating to practically every lawmaker there   including Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.)."
A Comcast spokeswoman told Politico that many of these reps represent districts where Comcast provides cable, Internet and phone service, and "it is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process...
"The company spent more than $3.5 million during 2011 and 2012 on a slew of Democratic and Republican candidates, and it has shelled out just under $2 million already in the 2014 cycle, according to federal records. That s in addition to millions of dollars of lobbying   and big donations to charitable causes and groups   that Comcast has committed to Washington annually.
"The company similarly donated to lawmakers and lobbied aggressively on Capitol Hill before winning the government s permission in 2011 to buy NBCUniversal. A stable of congressional allies at the time wrote letters and publicly defended the NBC acquisition...
"Fifteen of the 18 lawmakers who sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will hold its hearing on March 26, have taken home some form of a Comcast check. Sens. Durbin (D-Ill.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) all are running for reelection this year   and each has Comcast cash to show for it.
"So do [Sens. Ted] Cruz (R-Texas) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), as well as the leaders of the Senate s top antitrust panel, Klobuchar and Lee. Each of those members received Comcast donations this election cycle to their leadership PACs...
"Schumer... secured a commitment from Comcast on the very day of its merger announcement that it would not kill Time Warner Cable jobs in New York. After it was later revealed Schumer s brother helped orchestrate the deal, the senator pledged he d recuse himself from the matter...
"The House Judiciary Committee is readying another hearing on Comcast   and many of its members also are familiar with the company s financial support. Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), for example, has received $15,000 this cycle from Comcast, some for his leadership PAC and the rest for his personal campaign.
"The House Energy and Commerce Committee and its Senate counterpart so far haven t scheduled their own reviews of the new Comcast-Time Warner Cable deal. But both panels do regulate Comcast by way of their broad jurisdiction over Internet, cable and telephone issues... The company has given to 50 of 54 of the House committee s Democrats and Republicans, donating either to their reelection campaigns or their leadership PACs, according to a POLITICO analysis of campaign finance data from Jan. 1, 2013 to Jan. 31, 2014. And Comcast has donated in some way to 20 of 24 lawmakers on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee."

Franken Says Merged Comcast, Time Warner Cable  Will Be Bad for Consumers 
Advertisement
Comment
Having done two stints as a writer and performer on  Saturday Night Live,  Sen. Al Franken knows a thing or two about NBC. This morning on CBS, the Minnesota democrat said NBC parent company Comcast s acquisition of Time Warner Cable  will be bad for consumers of TV, of cable TV and of the Internet.
 I think consumers will end up paying more, there will be less competition, there will be less innovation and worse, even worse service,  Fraken said on  CBS This Morning. 
As chairman of the Privacy, Technology, and Law Subcommittee, Franken also discussed Steve Kroft s report on personal data being harvested by marketing companies.
 You saw it last night on  60 Minutes,'  said Franken.  I really believe that Americans have a right to privacy, that they have a right to know what s being taken, what of their private information s being taken, and to give permission if you re going to take their private information.

George Gaebler, president of the American Association for Respiratory Care, expressed his organization's concerns last week in an open letter to KentuckyOne Health CEO Ruth Brinkley . 
As WDRB reported on Tuesday, KentuckyOne is eliminating respiratory therapists at three Louisville-area emergency rooms -- Jewish Medical Centers South, Southwest and East -- and giving nurses a four-hour "refresher training" to take over respiratory care.
"We urge you to consider how backfilling these responsibilities with non-specialized health care providers may adversely impact patient care," Gaebler wrote to Brinkley.
A KentuckyOne spokeswoman had no immediate comment on Monday.
News of KentuckyOne's decision "really set off a firestorm" in the respiratory care community, said Timothy Myers, associate executive director of the American Association for Respiratory Care, which is based in Irving, Texas.
The respiratory care group wanted to "weigh in gingerly" on the situation while seeking more information from KentuckyOne about its plans, Myers said.
KentuckyOne maintains that respiratory care is within nurses' scope of practice and the decision to do without specialized therapists won't place patients at risk.
But practitioners told WDRB that nurses have little practical knowledge or training when it comes to the more complicated aspects of respiratory care, such as managing a mechanical ventilator.
Myers echoed those concerns on Monday.
"There is no way a nurse is prepared, A to Z, in respiratory care," he said, adding that it's "not possible" to teach proper operation of a ventilator machine in a four-hour course.
Here is text of Gaebler's letter to Brinkley:
Dr. Ms. Brinkley:
We have been informed by several of our members in Kentucky about layoffs of respiratory therapists in your health system. We understand that health care institutions must make business decisions to improve their financial viability, but we are concerned that this decision could compromise the quality and safety of care delivered to patients with cardiopulmonary disorders throughout your system.
While we are not fully apprised of the facts in the decision to eliminate respiratory therapists from some of your care settings, we do have concerns about the competency and proficiency of others who may be called upon to replace those respiratory therapists. As you know, respiratory therapists are professionals educated, credentialed and tested for competency and expertise in providing the full range of respiratory care services.
We urge you to consider how backfilling these responsibilities with non-specialized health care providers may adversely impact patient care. We also welcome the opportunity to have a dialogue with you about the roles, capabilities, and responsibilities of the respiratory therapist.
We would ask you to pleas reconsider the decision to remove any or all licensed, competency tested and proficient respiratory professionals from these settings for your patients with cardiopulmonary disease.
Sincerely,
George Gaebler, MSEd, RRT, FAARC

Smit: TWC Will Go All-Digital
Comcast Cable chief says integration team ready for TWC merger
By Michael Farrell
Noting at an industry conference Monday that Comcast has tackled big integrations before, Comcast Cable president and CEO Neil Smit said the cable giant has already assembled a small integration team for its pending merger with Time Warner Cable, adding that the initial focus will likely be on upgrading TWC plants to all-digital.
Smit, speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom conference in Palm Beach, Fla., said the primary focus will be to keep both businesses running well.
Comcast agreed on Feb. 13 to acquire Time Warner Cable in an all-stock deal valued at about $69 billion, including assumed debt. The merger, which will create a 30-million subscriber cable powerhouse with a near national reach, is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Some Indiana residents say the state's new slogan makes them look like unsophisticated bumpkins.
Indiana officials are defending the new tourism slogan, "Honest to Goodness Indiana." Others think it could hurt efforts to market Indianapolis as a vibrant destination.
Tourism officials say the slogan also represents all areas of the state.
But critics say it doesn't have anything to do with travel or tourism. Officials say two other finalists felt more like campaigns than sustainable brands.
The Honest to Goodness Indiana campaign rolls out this month.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A man was killed while crossing Dixie Highway early this morning.
It happened just before 7 a.m. That's when the victim, who has not yet been identified, was crossing Dixie Highway from Matheis Lane when he was struck by a pickup truck.
Police say it was still dark when the accident happened, and the driver of the pickup truck didn't see him. 
We're told no charges are expected to be filed.
"The truck driver did stop and attempted to render aid and took all the appropriate measures," said Josh Meyers with Shively Police. "There's no reason to believe at this point that the truck driver was under the influence of any intoxicants. He was just on his way to work and it's an unfortunate situation."
There's no word yet on the man's identity, but he is believed to be in his 60s.
The northbound and southbound lanes of Dixie Highway between Matheis Lane to just north of Nobel Place were shut down for several hours.

Comcast (Nasdaq: CMCSA) Cable President-CEO Neil Smit said today that things will start to move fast once the communications giant has the OK to acquire Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC) because, among other things, "we are very well aligned."
Smit
Speaking at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, Smit reportedly said that the two companies "differ slightly" in some areas of the triple play bundle on which Comcast tends to put more focus. Overall, he said, he's spent time with TWC execs and thinks things will work well and happen quickly, according to a story in The Hollywood Reporter.
"Some markets we will go into more aggressively. We intend to go at a fairly quick rate. I would like to see a lot of initiatives rolling out in the first year," he said.
While Smit, like other Comcast executives, sees the merger creating a mammoth force to drive cable television innovation and control prices--while opponents see it driving prices and limiting innovation--one of those most likely to be affected is apparently not sweating the details.
Verizon (NYSE: VZ) CFO Fran Shammo, speaking before Smit came on, said his company isn't overly concerned about a merged giant MSO.
"I'll just compete against Comcast tomorrow," Shammo said. "We're ready to compete."

Is Comcast Building the Next Magic Kingdom?
Analysis: Comcast wants to become  a new kind of monopolist. 
comment on this post
Let s connect the dots today. Here s Story A .
 Comcast execs led by executive vice president David Cohen pitched the Time Warner Cable deal to FCC commissioners last week in meetings over a couple of days,  Multichannel News reports.
Cohen offered three reasons why regulators should allow the merger:
  The combined company still has less than 30 percent of all cable subscriptions in the United States, a now-unusued thresshold the FCC formerly used in such cases.
  Comcast has already been through a big merger recently and demonstrated it can abide by federal conditions on the process.
  No net neutrality or other broadband harms, because Comcast already agreed to abide by current rules until 2018.
 which leads us to Story B: Politico reports Comcast has spread cash  to almost every member of Congress who has a hand in regulating it. 
In fact, money from Comcast s political action committee has flowed to all but three members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Checks have landed in the campaign coffers of Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), who oversee the chamber s antitrust panel.
Meanwhile, the cable giant has donated in some way to 32 of the 39 members of the House Judiciary Committee, which is planning a hearing of its own. And Comcast has canvassed the two congressional panels that chiefly regulate cable, broadband and other telecom issues, donating to practically every lawmaker there   including Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) and Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.).
Comcast stresses its donations are a function of its business.  Comcast NBCUniversal operates in 39 states and has 130,000 employees across the country,  said spokeswoman Sena Fitzmaurice.  It is important for our customers, our employees and our shareholders that we participate in the political process. The majority of our PAC contributions are to the senators and members who represent our employees and customers. 
Story C: TheStreet.com speculates what that money is intended for:
Comcast is determined to become a new kind of monopolist, combining elements of the old AT&T, Fox, and Disney empires. By using its massive lobbying power in Washington   it has contributed to nearly every senator overseeing its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable ( TWC_ )   Comcast first intends to become the dominant Internet pipe in the country. 
And the final leg of that plan, according to The Street? Become more magical than the Magic Kingdom. The Philadelphia Inquirer examined that possibility on Sunday, Story D.
This summer, Comcast will open a new Harry Potter ride and Potter-themed area at its second theme park, Univeral Studios Florida, which will share space with the original on the same 750-acre Universal complex.
To keep ticket-buying visitors for extra days, the cable-TV company is financing what it calls the largest hotel construction project in North America: the 1,800-room, 1960s-themed Cabana Bay Beach Resort   think of the biggest Wildwood hotel you know and imagine it stretching over multiple football fields.
Cabana Bay guests now can sleep, eat, and swim on the same complex as the theme parks. Comcast s 50-50 partner is Loews Corp.//
Which means: Brian Roberts is the 21st century version of Walt Disney. He just needs his own TV show.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Louisville Metro Police say they've arrested a man after he was caught driving a U.S. Postal Service truck while intoxicated.
According to an arrest report, it happened March 8, on Preston Hwy., just before 6 p.m.
Police say they received a report of a U.S. Postal Service truck "weaving all over the roadway and not stopping at red lights."
They caught up with the truck and allegedly found 59-year-old Edward C. Willard, a U.S. Postal Service employee, behind the wheel. At the time, police say Willard's truck was in two lanes of traffic, and witnesses were standing near the truck trying to talk to Willard.
Willard was "very incoherent, confused and could not follow directions," according to the arrest report.
He then allegedly tried to drive off after stating everything was okay.
Police say witnesses told them they saw him drinking from a bottle of Mountain Dew. According to the arrest report, officers found water bottles inside the vehicle, but they contained vodka.
Willard was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A Louisville woman is now facing a murder charge after her boyfriend died in the hospital over the weekend.
Police say 33-year-old Candra McWhorter, was originally charged with assault after she allegedly shot her boyfriend, 29-year-old Ollie Davis, in the chest on Feb. 26.
A police report states that McWhorter became involved in a verbal altercation with Davis at a home on Wilson Ave. The altercation escalated when McWhorter allegedly retrieved a handgun and shot Davis.  
In court Monday, McWhorter's attorney told the judge that his client is the real victim.
He died at University Hospital early Saturday morning, so the assault charge was amended to murder.
"He (Davis) was threatening people, Rob Eggert said. "It occurred in her daughter's bedroom. She fired one shot to protect herself. She called 911, she was tending to him when police got there. They interviewed her, they didn't arrest her."
The judge told Eggert that details of the case could be discussed at McWhorter's next court hearing.
McWhorter's bond was set at $25,000 full cash.

Comcast Makes TWC Case At FCC
EVP Cohen Headed Pitches Last Week 3/10/2014  9:11 AM Eastern
By: John Eggerton
 
Comcast execs led by executive vice president David Cohen pitched the Time Warner Cable deal to FCC commissioners last week in meetings over a couple of days.
Their take, according to one pitchee, boiled down to no harm, no foul in three key areas:
*No horizontal harms because the sub count would come in under the FCC's old 30% cap on a cable's subs, which a court threw out.
*No vertical harms because Comcast has already been there, done that via the FCC's conditions on the merger with NBCU, which conditions will extend automatically to the Time Warner Cable systems when they become Comcast systems.
*No broadband harms because Comcast is still subject to the FCC's anti-blocking and anti-discrimination rules through 2018 (and likely longer as a condition of the new deal, which would then apply those conditions to TWC as well). And because the broadband market has changed, and regardless of how many broadband subs the combined companies will have, it is hardly the only broadband game in town.
The Comcast team also pitched the combined company as providing  a stronger force in the ad market.  Cable and satellite companies are looking to compete for some of those targeted local political ads, for example, and the Justice Department has expressed concerns about station joint sales agreements being anti-competitive. Pitching Comcast as a force in political ad sales might resonate in that space.

Comments
If the Federal Communications Commission allows Comcast to buy Time Warner Cable , you can kiss any dreams of truly high-speed access to an open Internet goodbye. The Internet will be a far poorer place. And Comcast will be a far richer company.
There's already little broadband competition in the U.S., and this deal will all but kill it. Susan Crawford, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law and a visiting professor at Harvard Law School who has studied broadband competition, is a harsh critic of the proposed buyout . In an article for Bloomberg, she writes, "The reason this deal is scary is that for the vast majority of businesses in 19 of the 20 largest metropolitan areas in the country, their only choice for a high-capacity wired connection will be Comcast."
With little or no competition, Comcast will have little reason to increase the speed or lower the cost of broadband . And we need faster, cheaper broadband; the U.S. lags behind many countries in both areas. Akamai says that the average broadband speed in the U.S. is 7.4Mbps, only eighth in the world. And at an average price of $6.14 per Mbps , our broadband access is one of the most expensive in the developed world.
Comcast has already begun introducing broadband data caps, charging higher rates when those caps are exceeded. With the reduction in competition that will ensue from a Time Warner buyout, those caps won't go away.
Speed and price aren't the only concerns. Internet openness is also endangered. A U.S. court of appeals has already struck down FCC rules guaranteeing Net neutrality , which requires that ISPs treat all Internet traffic equally. Competition might keep companies from offering speedier access to websites willing to pay more and slowing down access to websites that don't cough up, but where will competition come from if this buyout goes through? Comcast would have such a dominant position that it could even black out websites if negotiations go poorly, taking a page from its buyout partner, Time Warner Cable, which blacked out CBS broadcasts for New York subscribers for weeks until it settled a contract disagreement with the television network.
When Comcast purchased NBCUniversal, it signed a consent decree with the FCC to adhere to Net neutrality, but only until 2017. After that, Comcast is free to do what it wants. Without any real competition able to offer customers an alternative, what chance is there that Comcast will stick to that agreement a minute longer than it has to?
I keep saying "if" this buyout goes through, but it's practically in the bag. Comcast has spread its tentacles deep into Washington's power centers. Meredith Attwell Baker, a onetime FCC commissioner who voted to approve Comcast's merger with NBCUniversal, is now a Comcast lobbyist . The New York Times reports that Comcast spent $18 million on lobbying in 2013 alone, that Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has golfed with President Obama and that Obama has visited Roberts' home on Martha's Vineyard. David Cohen, who heads Comcast's relationship with government regulators, has been a big Obama fundraiser, once hosting an event at his home that raised $1.2 million. Cohen was also recently a guest at a White House state dinner for French President Francois Hollande.
Still, the deal isn't done yet. Luckily in this case, the wheels of government grind slowly, and it could take up to a year before the FCC rules on it. It's a year that opponents should use to do everything they can to stop it.

BROWNSVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has proposed removing a dam on the Green River near Mammoth Cave National Park.
The Daily News reports a study includes the recommendation, saying the action would improve aquatic life and recreational activities. Alternative actions include modifying the lock and not disturbing the dam, installing a barricade and disposing of the property or doing nothing.
The river has been closed to navigational traffic for decades and the study says the dams on the river have continued to deteriorate. In addition to removing Green River Dam No. 6 near Mammoth Cave, the study recommends disposing of three other dams along the river as well as Barren River Lock and Dam No. 1.
The federal agency is accepting comments on the proposal through March 17.

PEKIN, In. (WDRB) --Hanging and laughing with friends, and signing those Luke Bryan songs everyone at school likes, it's what young girls do when they're healthy.
Those are the moments, now few and far between, that Trinity Goodson cherishes.
"It started June 21st of 2012. It's been going on for about 19 months," she explained.
Trinity was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
"It felt like a nuclear bomb had been dropped on my family," her mom, Laura said.
Trinity rapidly began to lose her hair, and was forced to call Kosair Children's Hospital home. Her family feared the worst.
"That I was going to bury my 10-year-old child," said Trinity's mom.
The prognosis teeter-tottered. Then, a bright spot..
"They declared Trinity in remission in October," Laura Goodson said.
"I relapsed in November, and now I'm facing a bone marrow transplant," Trinity explained.
It's easy for anyone in that spot to feel beat up, and less than positive, but that's what friends and family are for.
"I think the biggest thing that we wanted was for Trinity to feel uplifted and connected to us," Trinity's aunt, Lori Farris said.
So she and her daughter, Morgan, created a Facebook page called "Hearts for Trinity." The idea was to have people from wherever learn about Trinity's story and send hearts of all kinds showing their love and support.
"Not only her family, but other people were rooting for her and were behind her," Farris said.
"Likes" on the page started to sky rocket.
"It makes me really happy, and it makes me feel good because I know I'm not alone in my fight," Trinity said.
It isn't a cure, but hopefully the messages can tide a tough little girl and her family over, until she can get back to the life she loves and deserves.
To help Trinity go to: gofundme.com/heartsfortrinity

WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. employers advertised slightly more jobs in January than in December, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.
The Labor Department says employers posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 percent from December. That is still below November's nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.
The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.
Total hiring slipped 0.9 percent to 4.5 million in January. That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly 5 million people are hired each month.

WASHINGTON   U.S. employers advertised slightly more jobs in January than in December, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.
The Labor Department said Tuesday employers posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 percent from December. That is still below November s nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.
There are about 2.6 unemployed Americans, on average, for each open job, the report shows. That s close to the ratio of 2 to 1 that is typical of healthier economies. The ratio of unemployed people to available jobs reached a record 6.7 in July 2009, just after the recession ended.
The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.
And a separate report by ManpowerGroup, the staffing company, found that U.S. employers are more optimistic about hiring this spring. Nineteen percent of companies surveyed said they planned to add jobs in the April-June quarter, the most since last fall.
Last week s employment report showed 175,000 net job gains in February. That s the number of people hired minus those who were laid off, quit or retired.
Tuesday s government report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, provides more details. It shows the overall number of people hired each month, rather than just the net gain. It also includes data on the number of people quitting or being laid off.
Overall hiring slipped 0.9 percent to 4.5 million in January.
That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly 5 million people are hired each month.
The number of people who quit their jobs fell slightly last month, the report said, while layoffs ticked up.
The additional data in the JOLTs report illustrates how much churn is taking place in the job market. A healthier job market usually includes more people quitting and greater overall hiring.
Quits can be a positive sign because people typically quit when they have a new job or are confident they will find one. More quits also open up more positions for job-seekers.
Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has said the Fed is monitoring the quits and hiring figures as key indicators of the job market s health.
Openings rose in January in construction, education and health care, and hotels and restaurants. They dropped in manufacturing and retail.

Weather has pummeled the American labor market this winter. Yet job creation was stronger than expected in February, despite the exceptionally cold and wintery weather experienced by much of the country. The Department of Labor announced last Friday that U.S. employers added 175,000 jobs to payrolls last month   a pace far surpassing both December and January, when payrolls expanded by 84,000 and 129,000 jobs, respectively. While the most recent Employment Situation Report upwardly revised both of the previous two months  figures, hiring in December and January was still hobbled, and February s gain represented a significant acceleration in job creation.
 Hiring was delayed during the winter due to bad weather, and I think we ve started to see some catch-up already in the February figures,  HSBC Securities economist Ryan Wang told Bloomberg on Tuesday.  We ll continue to see gradual improvement in measures like quit rates and hiring rates.  These government figures are released in the Labor Department s  Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey , or JOLTS.
The Labor Department s JOLTS report confirmed that employment trends appear to be improving; U.S. employers advertised slightly more jobs in January than in December, which signals that hiring should remain steady in the coming months. Data showed that employers posted 3.97 million job openings in the first month of the year. That gain represents a 1.5 percent increase from December s 3.91 million and places job openings slightly below November s nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.
With the labor market showing a modicum of stronger job creation, competition for employment has eased, although 10.2 million Americans remained unemployed in the first month of the year. January s increase in job openings left an average of 2.57 unemployed Americans for each open position   a decrease from the ratio of 2.64 recorded in December 2013 and 3.33 in January 2013.
In a healthy economy, that ratio is typically 2 to 1. When the recession began in December 2007, the ratio between the unemployment level and job openings was 1.8 and at the end of the recession in June 2009, there were 6.2 unemployed persons for every job opening. That metric has been steadily declining, but as with the unemployment rate, that lower ratio of job seekers to available jobs has dropped partially because some individuals have stopped looking for work.
Openings increased in January in construction, education, health care , and hotels, while they decreased in manufacturing and retail.
Meanwhile, hiring declined 0.9 percent from December s 4.58 million new payroll additions to 4.54 million, a dip that points to one worrying sign: Job openings have generally bounced back to pre-recession levels, but hiring is still lagging. By comparison, about 5 million people are hired each month in a healthy job market. But the hiring rate did remain unchanged at 3.3 percent. Over the 12 months ending in January, the number of hires changed little for total nonfarm, total private, and government employers.
Stepping back to look at the larger picture, the hole left in the jobs market left by the recession is still gaping; 3.8 million people have been out of work for more than six months and more than 10.5 million in total are without work.
Total firings, which exclude retirements and those who left their job voluntarily, increased to 1.74 million in January, from 1.7 million a month before. Separations   including quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations   totaled 4.5 million, a figure little changed from December, with the quitting rate remaining fairly constant at 1.7 percent and the layoffs and discharges rate little changed at 1.3 percent.
 Total separations is referred to as turnover. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee,  explained the report.  Therefore, the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers  willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations include separations due to retirement, death, and disability, as well as transfers to other locations of the same firm. 
Large numbers of hires and separations occur every month throughout the business cycle. Net employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hiring was steady or decreasing. Over the twelve months ending in January 2014, hires totaled 54.3 million and separations totaled 52.1 million, producing a net employment gain of 2.2 million. That net employment gain does look weak when compared to the total number of unemployed Americans.
Still, the number of available of jobs was strong in January, even though the Labor Department s Employment Situation Report for the month revealed that job growth had slackened in the first month of the a year, a downturn economists have partly attributed to the unusually cold and stormy weather that plagued much of the country. The jobs report showed U.S. employers added only 129,000 jobs to payrolls in January   the second straight month of weaker-than-expected employment gains. With 129,000 jobs added to payrolls, job growth was not nearly as low as in December, but it was still significantly weak.
After the report was released, the question for economists was whether to renew concerns for the economy s ability to create jobs and whether the Federal Reserve would respond to the data by re-evaluating its decision to taper the central bank s monetary stimulus program.
At the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which took place between the 28 and 29 of January, policymakers found labor market indicators to appear  consistent with a gradual ongoing improvement in labor market conditions,  as the minutes state.  Among other indicators of labor market conditions, the rate of job openings edged up in recent months.  The next meeting will take place later this month.
The JOLTS report is one of Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen s favorite economic releases.  In addition, I am likely to supplement the data on employment and unemployment with measures of gross job flows, such as job loss and hiring, which describe the underlying dynamics of the labor market,  she said at a March 2013 National Association for Business Economics policy conference.  For instance, layoffs and discharges as a share of total employment have already returned to their pre-recession level, while the hiring rate remains depressed. Therefore, going forward, I would look for an increase in the rate of hiring.

WHAT IT MEANS: The Federal Reserve is meeting next week and the Job Openings and Separations report is supposed to be one of Chair Janet Yellen's favorite indicators. It provides a look not only at what firms are doing but also at the behavior of workers. On the business side, while hiring did slow a bit in January, the deceleration was hardly due to an unwillingness to add workers. Indeed, job openings soared and are up sharply over the year. While available positions jumped by 7.6% between January 2013 and January 2014, the pace of hiring increased by only 3.3%. That points to a backlog in hiring that should start showing up. Similarly, in the March National Federation of Independent Businesses survey, it was reported that "40 percent of the respondents indicated that there were few or no qualified candidates for open positions" and "Twenty-two (22) percent of all owners reported job openings they could not fill in the current period". Demand for workers is building and it is just a matter of time when the openings get filled. As for worker perceptions of conditions, a look at the quit rates points to growing confidence that jobs are becoming more readily available. While the number of quits was off in January, it was up solidly over the year. People haven't been leaving their jobs for a long time for fear of not finding another one. Now they are doing that, especially in professional and business services, where the number rose by 33% and in retail, where it was up by 16%.
MARKETS AND FED POLICY IMPLICATIONS: We will not know for months how the weather affected the economy but we can look for underlying trends and they seem to be up. The JOLTS report was hardly a great one but when you compare a reasonably decent January 2013 with an ugly January 2014 and you still get really good numbers, it does point to an improving situation. I am watching the turnover numbers, in particular, the quit rates. If they continue to rise, it will be a clear indication of growing worker confidence that the labor market is strengthening. Since it bottomed in mid-2008, the rate has increased nearly fifty percent. It is still, though, about twenty percent below the rates posted during the mid-2000s, so we still have a long way to go. I don't expect the quit rate to be near the previous peak before year's end but as it approaches it, you can expect wage gains to accelerate as businesses attempt to retain their workforce. This is something I also believe will be a factor in Janet Yellen's thinking when it comes to tapering and ultimately when to raise rates, so watch these numbers carefully. As for the markets, this report is not usually a major market mover and is not likely to be one today, especially since it is lagged and traders and investors worry about the latest number, not a delayed one. They should.

Job postings rise in January

WASHINGTON   U.S. employers advertised slightly more jobs in January than in December, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.
The Labor Department said Tuesday that employers posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 percent from December. That is still below November's nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.
There are about 2.6 unemployed Americans, on average, for each open job, the report shows. That's close to the ratio of 2 to 1 that is typical of healthier economies. The ratio of unemployed people to available jobs reached a record 6.7 in July 2009, just after the recession ended.
The job market may be emerging from a winter slump. Employers added 175,000 jobs in February, the government said last week. That was much higher than in December and January, when cold weather lowered job growth.
And a separate report by ManpowerGroup, the staffing company, found that U.S. employers are more optimistic about hiring this spring. Nineteen percent of companies surveyed said they planned to add jobs in the April-June quarter, the most since last fall.
Last week's employment report showed 175,000 net job gains in February. That's the number of people hired minus those who were laid off, quit or retired.
Tuesday's government report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, provides more details. It shows the overall number of people hired each month, rather than just the net gain. It also includes data on the number of people quitting or being laid off.
Overall hiring slipped 0.9 percent to 4.5 million in January. That hiring total might sound like a lot, but in a healthy job market, roughly 5 million people are hired each month.
The number of people who quit their jobs fell slightly last month, the report said, while layoffs ticked up.
The additional data in the JOLTs report illustrates how much churn is taking place in the job market. A healthier job market usually includes more people quitting and greater overall hiring.
Quits can be a positive sign because people typically quit when they have a new job or are confident they will find one. More quits also open up more positions for job-seekers.
Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, has said the Fed is monitoring the quits and hiring figures as key indicators of the job market's health.
Openings rose in January in construction, education and health care, and hotels and restaurants. They dropped in manufacturing and retail.

Employers in the U.S. posted slightly more jobs in January despite harsh weather in many parts of the country, a positive sign for the labor market in coming months.
Job openings rose to nearly 4 million in January, a 1.5% increase from the month before, the Labor Department said Tuesday. That was just south of November's five-year high of 4.1 million.
Leisure and hospitality added 156,000 net openings in the first month of 2014. Construction opened up 32,000 extra slots, while education and health services added 65,000 openings.
The Tuesday report estimated that for every open job, there are about 2.6 unemployed U.S. workers. That's a big improvement from the 2009 peak of 6.7 jobless Americans per open position.
However, not all the news was rosy.
Hiring overall actually fell 0.9%, to 4.5 million, from the month prior. Although more companies are posting open positions, many are still taking their time and hiring carefully.
The U.S. economy in January added 129,000 net new jobs, the second straight month of weak gains. But February perked up with a surprisingly robust 175,000 new jobs despite continued snowstorms and bad weather.

WASHINGTON - U.S. employers advertised slightly more jobs in January than in December, a sign that hiring should remain steady in coming months.
The Labor Department said Tuesday that employers posted 3.9 million job openings, up 1.5 percent from December. That is still below November's nearly six-year high of 4.1 million, the first month that openings topped 4 million since March 2008.

A separate report by Manpower Group, the staffing company, found that U.S. employers are more optimistic about hiring this spring. Nineteen percent of companies surveyed said they planned to add jobs in the April-June quarter, the most since last fall.
"With 92 percent of U.S. employers planning to hire or keep their staff levels steady, I think there is a sense of optimism that  demand for goods and services is getting more predictable, and this is allowing  employers to feel more comfortable about business growth," Chris Layden, a  spokesman for Experis, a division of Manpower, told CBS Radio News.
The Labor Department said employers added 175,000 jobs in February, but the unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent. Charlie Rose reports.

The number of people who quit their jobs fell slightly last month, to 2.3 million, the report said, while layoffs ticked up. The rate at which workers voluntarily left their jobs has hardly budged over the last year, a sign that the labor market continues to underperform.
Quits can be a positive sign because people typically quit when they have a new job or are confident they will find one. More quits also open up more positions for job-seekers. As result, a healthier job market usually includes more people quitting and greater overall hiring.
During the economic boom that preceded that the 2008 financial crisis,  around 3 million per month quit their jobs, according to  Wrightson ICAP. In a client note, the research firm said that bad weather had likely affected the number of job openings and that it expects "some improvement" in the spring.

U.S. Job Openings Steady at 4.0 Million in January
March, 11 2014
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
There were 4.0 million job openings on the last business day of January, little changed from December. The hires rate (3.3 percent) and the separations rate (3.2 percent) also were little changed in January. The annual levels and rates for 2013 are now available.
There were 4.0 million job openings on the last business day of January, little changed from December,
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. The hires rate (3.3 percent) and separations rate (3.2
percent) were little changed in January. This release includes estimates of the number and rate of job
openings, hires, and separations for the nonfarm sector by industry and by geographic region. The
release also includes 2013 annual estimates for hires and separations. The annual levels for hires and
quits increased in 2013 while the annual total for layoffs and discharges decreased.
Job Openings
There were 4.0 million job openings in January, little changed from December. The number of openings
also was little changed in total private and government. The number of job openings decreased in retail
trade; the number increased in health care and social assistance and in arts, entertainment, and
recreation. The West region experienced a rise in job openings in January. (See table 1.)
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
|                             Revisions to the JOLTS Data                                          |
|Job openings, hires, and separations data have been revised from December 2000 forward to         |
|incorporate annual updates to the Current Employment Statistics employment estimates and the Job  |
|Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) seasonal adjustment factors. In addition, durable |
|goods manufacturing and nondurable goods manufacturing data are now available on a seasonally     |
|adjusted basis. See the note at the end of this release for more information about these changes. |
|__________________________________________________________________________________________________|
The number of job openings (not seasonally adjusted) increased over the year for total nonfarm and total
private but decreased for government. Over the year, the number of job openings increased in several
industries while it decreased in real estate and rental and leasing and in federal government. The
Midwest and West regions experienced an increase in the number of job openings over the 12 months
ending in January. (See table 7.)
Hires
There were 4.5 million hires in January, little changed from December. The number of hires was
essentially unchanged for total private and government. The number of hires fell in January in retail
trade and in the Midwest. (See table 2.)
Over the 12 months ending in January, the number of hires (not seasonally adjusted) changed little for
total nonfarm, total private, and government. Hires levels rose over the year in professional and business
services and in educational services. The number of hires was little changed in all four regions. (See
table 8.)
Total separations includes quits, layoffs and discharges, and other separations. Total separations is
referred to as turnover. Quits are generally voluntary separations initiated by the employee. Therefore,
the quits rate can serve as a measure of workers  willingness or ability to leave jobs. Layoffs and
discharges are involuntary separations initiated by the employer. Other separations include separations
due to retirement, death, and disability, as well as transfers to other locations of the same firm.
There were 4.5 million total separations in January, little changed from December. The number of total
separations was essentially unchanged for total private and government. (See table 3.)
In January, the quits rate was little changed at 1.7 percent for total nonfarm. The rate was little changed
for total private (1.9 percent) and unchanged for government (0.6 percent). The quits rate was essentially
unchanged over the month in all industries and in all four regions. (See table 4.)
The number of quits (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed over the 12 months ending in January
for total nonfarm, total private, and government. The number of quits rose over the year in retail trade
and professional and business services but fell in finance and insurance. The number of quits was
essentially unchanged in all four regions over the year. (See table 10.)
The layoffs and discharges rate was little changed in January at 1.3 percent. The rate was unchanged
over the month for total private (1.4 percent) and government (0.5 percent). The layoffs and discharges
rate was little changed in all four regions. Seasonally adjusted estimates of layoffs and discharges are
not available for individual industries. (See table 5.)
The layoffs and discharges level (not seasonally adjusted) was little changed over the 12 months ending
in January for total nonfarm, total private, and government. The number of layoffs and discharges rose
over the year for several industries but fell in mining and logging. The number of layoffs and discharges
rose in the Midwest. (See table 11.)
In January, there were 341,000 other separations for total nonfarm, little changed from December. The
number of other separations also was little changed over the month for total private and government.
(See table 6.) Seasonally adjusted estimates of other separations are not available for individual
industries or regions. Over the 12 months ending in January, the number of other separations was little
changed for total nonfarm, total private, and government. (See table 12.)
Net Change in Employment
Large numbers of hires and separations occur every month throughout the business cycle. Net
employment change results from the relationship between hires and separations. When the number of
hires exceeds the number of separations, employment rises, even if the hires level is steady or declining.
Conversely, when the number of hires is less than the number of separations, employment declines, even
if the hires level is steady or rising. Over the 12 months ending in January 2014, hires totaled 54.3
million and separations totaled 52.1 million, yielding a net employment gain of 2.2 million. These
figures include workers who may have been hired and separated more than once during the year.
Annual Levels and Rates
This release contains the 2013 annual levels and rates for hires, total separations, quits, layoffs and
discharges, and other separations. Note that annual figures for job openings are not calculated because
job openings are measured on a stock, or point-in-time, basis rather than on a flow basis over a specified
time period. The annual figures and additional tables are published with the release of January data each
year. (See the Technical Note for additional information on these measures.)
Calculating annual levels and rates allows additional comparisons across years. In 2013, annual levels
for hires, quits, and other separations rose for the fourth consecutive year. The layoffs and discharges
annual level decreased in 2013 after holding steady in 2012.
In 2013, annual hires increased to 54.2 million (39.7 percent of employment) and annual total
separations rose to 51.8 million (38.0 percent of employment). Annual quits increased to 27.6 million
(20.3 percent of employment) in 2013. Annual layoffs and discharges decreased in 2013 to 20.0 million
(14.6 percent of employment). Annual other separations rose in 2013 to 4.3 million (3.1 percent of
employment). (See tables 13 through 22.)
____________
The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey results for February 2014 are scheduled to be
released on Tuesday, April 8, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. (EDT).

Job openings came in at 3.974 million, below the 4.015 million   expected but up from December's revised print of 3.914 million.
The hire rate and separation rate were basically unchanged at   3.3% and 3.2%, respectively.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics' "JOLTS Report" may not be as   market moving as monthly nonfarm payrolls, but it does gives key insights into the labor market on hires, quits, layoffs,   and job openings.
In fact, the Federal Reserve's new chair Janet Yellen has cited   JOLTS as one of her favorite reports . As the unemployment rate edges   toward the Fed's targets over the next few years, JOLTS could   possibly play a larger role when the central bank determines   interest rate policy.

Businessmen walk in the snow. The tough winter weather that North America has experienced these past 3 months is holding back the economy, the OECD says. (Joe Bryksa)

Cold weather hurting U.S. economy, Fed's Beige Book says
Brutal winter weather is holding back the global economy, but it's on track for solid growth later in the year, a major economic think-tank says.
The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development said in its quarterly assessment for the global economy that the world's developed economies are generally performing strongly and getting back to levels of growth and activity that existed before 2008, when the recession began.
It's a different story on North America, however, which has been dealing with a particularly nasty bout of winter weather. It's been so bad that growth is expected to be negligible when the data come in for the first three months, in both the U.S. and Canada.
INFOGRAPHIC: What is a Polar Vortex?
U.S. growth is expected to come in at around 1.7 per cent for the January to March period. In Canada, the number is even bleaker   a mere 0.5 per cent. Both figures are well behind growth rates seen elsewhere in the developed world.
The average growth rate across G7 countries is expected to be 2.2 per cent.
"The United States and Canada are both also expected to experience an uneven pattern of growth in the near term, owing in part to the disruptive effect of repeated episodes of severe winter weather," the think-tank said.
"A number of activities were restrained by the storms and cold temperatures, which is likely to depress first-quarter GDP, with some bounceback effect in the second quarter in the absence of further negative shocks."
But the slowdown, even in chilly North America, will be temporary, the OECD says, after winter eventually releases its icy grip. Canada's economy will expand by 2.4 per cent in the spring quarter, the OECD predicts.
In almost all economies, consensus forecasts for 2014 have ratcheted up over the last few months.
The North American slowdown actually started in the last quarter of 2013, as the U.S. government shutdown caused economic activity overall to be slower than it would have been otherwise.

Recovery proceeds in advanced economies; Mixed in emerging economies
By Michael Hennigan, Finfacts founder and editor
Mar 11, 2014 - 3:29 PM
  Printer friendly page
Recovery is under way in the world s advanced economies, underpinned by  supportive financial conditions and reduced drag from budgetary tightening, but  activity in the major emerging markets is mixed, according to the OECD s  latest Interim Economic Assessment .
The Paris-based think-tank for 34 mainly developed  country governments says taht the recovery is advancing well in the United States and the United Kingdom, but  proceeding more unevenly in Japan and still lagging behind in the Eurozone. A  series of one-off factors   severe winter weather in North America and  anticipation of an April 1st rise in Japanese  consumption tax   have led to an uneven pace of growth. 
Some major emerging economies continue growing at a fast pace, including China,  but others have lost momentum. Tighter financial conditions are compounding the  growth slowdown in emerging economies.
The OECD projects that the US will grow at an annualised rate of 3.1% in  the second quarter of 2014, after first quarter activity was affected adversely  by exceptionally cold weather. Extreme weather also impacted Canada, which is  expected to experience similarly uneven growth in the first quarter, followed by  a bounce back in the second quarter that should push the growth rate up to 2.4%.  
In Japan, planned fiscal consolidation is projected to cut into near-term  growth. Implementation of a higher consumption tax rate is expected to result in  a surge in activity in the current quarter, as consumers bring forward  purchases, pushing growth up to an annualised rate of 4.8%. This will be  counterbalanced by a contraction of activity in the second quarter before a more  normal pattern of recovery gets back on track.
The UK is projected to grow at annualised rates above 3% in the first and  second quarters, but the Eurozone s growth rate - while improving - still lags  that of other advanced economies.
Wide disparities are still seen in Europe, where the three largest economies  (Germany, France and Italy) will grow at a combined weighted average of 1.9% rate in the first quarter and a 1.4% pace in the second. Germany  is forecast to grow by about 3.7% annualised in the first quarter and 2.5% in the second quarter, while the French economy s annualised growth rate  will hover around 1% and Italy s will remain below 1% for each of  the first two quarters. 
Ireland
The OECD says short-term indicators signal that activity is regaining strength, and   exports are expected to be the main source of growth in the years ahead,  notwithstanding the expiry of some drug patents. High debts continue to  constrain households  and firms  spending, although the housing market  is showing the first signs of stabilisation. Inflationary pressures are  expected to remain weak.
The think-tank says rising non-performing loans are weakening banks and SMEs  continue to experience difficulties in accessing credit. Lending conditions  remain among the tightest in Europe. The strategy set out by the Central  Bank of Ireland, including quarterly quantitative targets for dealing with  mortgage arrears, should be fully implemented to foster on-going balance  sheet adjustments and improve credit supply.
The export-led recovery is expected to gather strength in 2014 and  2015 in line with the projected pick-up in Europe. Domestic demand will  gradually recover as the labour market improves.
GDP is expected to rose 1.9% in 2014 and 2.2% in 2015.

PARIS   The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan should consider adding monetary stimulus, while the Federal Reserve needs to carefully trim support, the Bloomberg news agency reported the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as saying.
In the United States,  the scaling down of quantitative easing has begun and a gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus should be carried out over the coming two years,  the OECD said in its interim economic report today.  In Japan and the euro area, however, supportive monetary conditions must be maintained, with a possible need for further stimulus. 
The OECD view underlines the diverging economic conditions around the world as the rebound in the US strengthens while Europe s recovery lags behind much of the rest of the world in the wake of its sovereign-debt crisis.
The Paris-based organisation predicts the US will expand 1.7 per cent and 3.1 per cent in the first two quarters of this year, while the combined growth of the three largest euro-area economies will be 1.9 per cent and 1.4 per cent. The UK is set for growth of 3.3 per cent in both quarters. Japan will expand 4.8 per cent in the first quarter and shrink 2.9 per cent in the second, according to the report.
 The euro area appears to be improving, so far it is doing so later and at a slower pace than other major economies,  the OECD said.  Inflation in the euro area has fallen further below target and is likely to stay very low for an extended period. 
Many emerging markets risk further turmoil in financial markets as the Fed withdraws monetary support, while China is vulnerable to excess debt building up among banks, the report added.
 The possibility persists of a sharp slowdown in China driven by balance-sheet effects,  the OECD said. The Chinese authorities  need to restrain credit growth, which would help address the growing vulnerability of the financial system.

OECD: Emerging Economies Holding Back Global Recovery

PARIS    The recovery in developed economies is on track although slowing activity in big emerging markets means global growth will be only moderate at best in the near term, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Tuesday.
Exceptionally bad winter weather in North America and a sales tax hike in Japan are also disrupting the pace of recovery, according to OECD said.
Against that backdrop, the OECD urged the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan to keep up their monetary stimulus, if not increase it, while it said the U.S. Federal Reserve was right to begin winding down its bond-buying program.
 The gradual recovery in the advanced economies is encouraging, even if temporary factors have pushed down growth rates in the early months of this year, while the slowdown in emerging economies is likely to be a drag on global growth,  OECD acting chief economist Rintaro Tamaki said in a statement.
Slower growth
Growth for major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be slower than in the second half of 2013, but much improved from the sluggish rates of late 2012 and early 2013, the OECD said in an update of its views on the global economy.
 Given that emerging economies now account for over half the world economy, continued sub-par economic performance for several of the major EMEs [emerging market economies] is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term,  the OECD said.
It estimated growth in the United States would slow to 1.7 percent in the first quarter from the previous three months on an annualized basis, down from 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter when exceptionally bad weather weighed on activity.
Japanese growth would surge 4.8 percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter as consumers brought forward purchases ahead of a sales tax increase on April 1.
The OECD gave its updated forecasts as part of an interim health-check for the global economy before its much more detailed Economic Outlook due in May. It did not update its estimates for U.S. and Japanese growth in the second quarter because one-off factors made it too problematic, it said.
Euro zone
Turning to Europe, the OECD saw Germany's quarter-on-quarter annualized growth rate reaching 3.7 percent in the first quarter before slowing to 2.5 percent.
France, the euro zone's second biggest economy after Germany, was seen growing only 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year, rising to 1 percent in the second quarter.
Outside the euro zone, the British economy was seen growing 3.3 percent in both the first and second quarters.
Turning to emerging market economies, the OECD said some were seeing a marked loss of momentum as capital outflows exposed vulnerabilities in some countries.
It noted that Brazil, India, South Africa and Turkey among others have been forced to raise interest rates to keep capital outflows in check.
Meanwhile, weak balance sheets in China raised the risk of a sharp slowdown there, the OECD said.

Global Growth Likely To Remain Sluggish
Tue, 03/11/2014 - 10:04am Comments
by Greg Keller, Associated Press
PARIS (AP) -- Global growth is likely to remain sluggish as a slowdown in the developing world undercuts gains in Europe and the United States, a leading international economic body warned Tuesday.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said one-off factors like the harsh winter weather in North America and the U.S. government shutdown mean "growth for the major advanced economies in the first half of 2014 will be somewhat slower than in the second half of 2013."
The underlying trend for those economies, however, continues to be of strengthening growth, said the OECD, a think tank for the world's most developed countries, in an update to forecasts made in November.
Meanwhile, emerging economies, which now account for over half the world economy, "are experiencing a marked loss of momentum," the OECD said. If that continues, the OECD warned it "is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term."
In its World Economic Outlook, the organization forecasts global growth of 3.6 percent this year, from an estimated 2.7 percent in 2013. It says the recovery in the United States "is relatively well established," contrary to what it sees happening in the EU and Japan, where the OECD called for further monetary stimulus.
The OECD warned that while activity in the EU seems to be improving, "so far it is doing so later and at a slower pace than in the other major economies."
It also warned that the dip in growth in the U.S. over the winter could have longer-lasting repercussion. "If the recent economic weakness were to durably depress confidence, it could undermine the recovery," the OECD said.

Emerging economies holding back global recovery, says OECD

OECD sees pick-up
The harsh Canadian winter is playing havoc with the economy, but the OECD expects something of a rebound in the second quarter of the year.
 The United States and Canada are both also expected to experience an uneven pattern of growth in the near term, owing in part to the disruptive effect of repeated episodes of severe winter weather,  the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said today in its interim economic assessment.
 A number of activities were restrained by the storms and cold temperatures, which is likely to depress first-quarter GDP, with some bounce-back effect in the second quarter in the absence of further negative shocks. 
Canadians are, of course, used to wretched winters, but this one has been particularly ugly, as the OECD noted.
In its new report, the group forecasts first-quarter economic growth of just 0.5 per cent in the current quarter, but, given  one-off factors,  could not update its projection for the second quarter.
In November, it forecast second-quarter growth at 2.4 per cent.
According to the latest reading by Statistics Canada, the economy expanded in the fourth quarter at an annual pace of 2.9 per cent, though contracted 0.5 per cent in December, the month of an ice storm.
Over all, the OECD said today that  most signs  point to stronger growth in the world s big advanced economies, boosted by the easy money policies of their central banks and  reduced fiscal drag. 
But, as others have warned, emerging market countries have a  more mixed  showing, with some  continuing to grow strongly while others, where underlying vulnerabilities have been highlighted by reversals of capital inflows, are experiencing a marked loss of momentum. 
The group pointed directly to the easing of stimulus measures by the Federal Reserve, which is hitting some of the emerging markets.
That, the OECD suggested, means the U.S. central bank should  proceed cautiously, with a careful communications policy to smooth expectations. 
A number of one-off factors, such as the U.S. government shutdown last fall and December s weather woes, have hurt the overall pace of economic growth in the Group of Seven nations.
 Nonetheless, in most of the major advanced economies fourth-quarter GDP growth was better than expected, and consensus forecasts for 2014 have ratcheted up over the last few months,  the OECD said.

The loss of economic momentum in some emerging market economies (EME) is affecting global growth, the OECD has warned, despite strengthening recoveries in most developed economies.
In its Interim Economic Assessment, published Tuesday, the organization said that "transitory factors" had led to an uneven growth picture in several cases, with emerging economies of particular concern.

"Given that emerging economies now account for over half the world economy, continued sub-par economic performance for several of the major EMEs is likely to mean that global growth remains only moderate in the near term," it said.
Across the G7 group of leading industrialized nations, the OECD expects gross domestic product (GDP) growth to expand from 2 percent at the end of 2013, to 2.2 percent in the first quarter of 2014, before falling back to 2 percent in the second three months of the year.
(Read more: Fed taper 'predictable, unavoidable': OECD Secretary )
The organization added that although a number of risks had diminished   such as political wrangling over the U.S. debt ceiling and the outlook for Europe's banking sector   some long-standing risks remain.
"Japan is only just beginning to confront its daunting fiscal challenges, fragilities in the euro area are still acute, and the possibility persists of a sharp slowdown in China driven by balance sheet effects," it said.
"In addition, the adjustment of monetary policy in advanced economies as the cycle progresses continues to pose a risk to stability in some emerging economies, and crises there could spread and in turn exert a drag on growth in advanced economies."

Emerging Markets
Emerging market economies took a battering in January amid ongoing concerns about political upheaval, slowing growth and U.S. monetary policy, prompting some central bankers and policymakers to scramble for a response.
Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and India all tightened monetary policy in an effort to stem a reversal in capital inflows   which had boomed since the U.S. Federal Reserve started its bond-buying program in 2008. The Fed announced that it would begin tapering off its stimulus in December 2013.
The OECD's Composite Leading Indicators showed a downward trend for BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and China) excluding China, signaling a cyclical slowdown.
Growth in emerging market economies could be hit as the U.S. continues to scale back its asset purchases, and as investors focus on their vulnerabilities, the OECD said, adding that high levels of debt left some vulnerable to financial shocks.
"There remains a risk that the financial market volatility and strong capital outflows in recent months in some emerging economies could again intensify, exerting an additional drag on growth," it added.
Developed economies
By contrast, the OECD's Composite Leading Indicators show a strengthening growth momentum in the U.S., euro zone, Japan and the U.K.
The U.S.'s cyclical recovery was "relatively well established," according to the OECD, but it warned that growth looked set to slow as a result of the recent bad weather.
The organization forecast annualized gross domestic product (GDP) of 1.7 percent in the first three months of 2014 and 3.1 percent in the second quarter, after the U.S. government slashed estimates for fourth-quarter GDP to 2.4 percent.
(Read more: Legacy of financial crisis is 'very heavy': OECD's Gurria )
Both the U.S. and Canada were expected to experience an "uneven pattern of growth in the near term, owing in part to the disruptive effect of repeated episodes of severe winter weather," the OECD added.
Meanwhile, the organization forecast the U.K.'s economic growth to expand from 2.9 percent in the final quarter of 2013, to 3.3 percent in both the first and second quarter or this year.
It expects the euro zone's economy to continue to expand (by 1.9 percent in the first quarter of 2014, before slowing to 1.4 percent in the second quarter) but warned the pace of growth was slower than elsewhere.

Thursday, 20 Feb 2014 |  7:22  PM ET
"While activity in the euro area appears to be improving, so far it is doing so later and at a slower pace than in the other major economies," the OECD said. "Notably, while unemployment has been falling elsewhere, it has remained flat at stubbornly high levels in the euro area."
The organization also expressed concerns about the low level of inflation in the region, which came in at 0.8 percent in February   significantly below the European Central Bank's target of "close to 2 percent."
(Read more: Watch Out, World Bank: Here Comes the BRICS Bank )
While in Japan, the OECD noted that the country "appeared finally to be exiting from deflation" and that Abenomics had caused a "welcome rebound" in GDP.
But it stressed there were some challenges ahead for the economy, which it expects to grow by a massive 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2014, before slowing over the following three months.
"Japan is only just beginning to confront its daunting fiscal challenges, fragilities in the euro area are still acute, and the possibility persists of a sharp slowdown in China driven by balance sheet effects," the OECD said.
"In addition, the adjustment of monetary policy in advanced economies as the cycle progresses continues to pose a risk to stability in some emerging economies, and crises there could spread and in turn exert a drag on growth in advanced economies."

TABLE-OECD quarterly GDP forecasts for major economies
FULL COVERAGE:
INDIA ELECTIONS 2017
PARIS, March 11 Following are updated forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for growth in the world's main developed economies in the first and second quarters of 2014.     The GDP forecasts are for annualised, quarter-on-quarter growth and are based on GDP releases and high-frequency indicators published up to March 10. Data are seasonally and in some cases also working-day adjusted.     Because the estimates are on an annualised, quarter-on-quarter basis, they do not compare with the OECD's latest annual GDP forecasts dating from November.      The OECD said the second quarter forecasts for the United States, Japan and Canada had not been updated from its November Economic Outlook because of one-off factors that its model could not incorporate.*                          2013 Q3     2013 Q4     2014 Q1     2014 Q2  United States          4.1         2.4         1.7           *  Japan                  0.9         0.7         4.8           *  Germany                1.3         1.5         3.7         2.5  France                -0.2         1.2         0.7         1.0  Italy                 -0.1         0.5         0.7         0.1  Britain                3.4         2.9         3.3         3.3  Canada                 2.7         2.9         0.5           *  G7                     2.8         2.0         2.2         2.0  Euro area 3**          0.5         1.2         1.9         1.4     ** Weighted average of Germany, France and Italy.

Virtu Financial expects to raise up to $100 million in IPO
Tuesday, 11 Mar 2014 | 10:05  AM ET

Scott Eelis | Bloomberg | Getty Images
A trader with Virtu Financial Capital Markets (r) views a monitor at the NYSE.
Trading firm Virtu Financial, which posted only one day of trading losses in five years, plans to raise up to $100 million in an initial public offering, the company said in a regulatory filing.
Virtu said the IPO price was an estimate solely for the purpose of calculating the registration fee with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The company, a market maker in equities, fixed income, currencies and commodities markets, intends to list Class A shares on Nasdaq under the symbol "VIRT." Virtu will have three other share classes.
(Read more: Corporate debt fever surges to new record )
The underwriters for the offering include Goldman Sachs , J.P. Morgan and Sandler O'Neill Partners.
Vincent Viola, Virtu's founder and executive chairman, will control more than a majority of the combined voting power of the company's common stock after the offering.
Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, which acquired its stake in 2011, is the other major shareholder.
Last year, the company paid out $433.4 million in cash distributions to members.

Monday, 10 Mar 2014 |  4:14  PM ET
Virtu said as a result of its real-time risk management strategy and technology, the company had only one losing day of trading from the beginning of 2009 through the end of 2013, a total of 1,238 trading days.
Virtu reported a net income of $182.2 million on a revenue of $623.7 million last year, an increase from earnings of $87.6 million on $581.5 million in revenue in 2012.

Virtu employs a "market neutral" strategy in which it is not dependent on the direction of any particular market. The firm says it aims to lock in returns through "precise and nearly instantaneous hedging."
Virtu said it expected global electronic trading to continue to grow, after experiencing a compound annual rate of 13.7 percent over the past decade, according to the World Federation of Exchanges.

If the high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial Inc. succeeds in becoming a public company this year, it would confirm yet again that the investing public has thrown caution to the wind when it comes to initial public offerings.
Virtu filed its registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, and there was one disclosure in particular, on page 45, that caught my eye. The 12-year-old firm said that, in connection with its most recent audit, "we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting," as of Dec. 31. The details are a sight to behold. Basically, the company said it doesn't know how to do accounting.
"This material weakness related to our inability to prepare accurate financial statements, resulting from a lack of reconciliations, a lack of detailed review and insufficient resources and level of technical accounting expertise within the accounting function," Virtu's disclosure went on.
"Although we have hired senior accounting and finance employees, reallocated existing internal resources and retained third-party consultants to help enhance our internal controls over financial reporting following reviews of our accounting and finance function conducted by members of senior management and by a third-party consultant, there can be no assurance that we will remediate this material weakness or avoid future weaknesses or deficiencies."
You don't see trading firms admit to stuff like this very often. Remember MF Global Holdings Ltd. , led by former New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine? Its internal controls were a mess, only investors weren't told that until after the company blew up in 2011. The last time I recall a financial-services company disclosing control problems during the run-up to an IPO was in 2005 when Refco Inc. went public. It went bankrupt the same year, and its chief executive officer later went to jail.
Elsewhere in its registration statement, Virtu said it had $182.2 million of net income last year and $203.3 million of shareholder equity as of Dec. 31. But the disclosure that Virtu lacks the ability to prepare accurate financial statements means it's hard to know what to make of those numbers. (Virtu's auditor is Deloitte & Touche LLP.)
Now consider that, according to an article in the Financial Times, unnamed people familiar with Virtu's thinking said the IPO "could see the 151-person company raise as much as $250 million and give it a valuation of about $3 billion." The valuation would be several times its book value, which for a trading firm seems awfully rich. (Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trades for 1.1 times book.)
Here's a simple proposition: Trading firms should have effective controls before they go public. That way they have the systems and processes in place to safeguard their assets, monitor their risks, comply with regulations and produce reliable financial reports. If their controls aren't effective, they should fix them. And until they do, they should remain closely held. But these are wild times in the IPO market, and Virtu has decided it disagrees.
At least investors can't say they weren't warned.

Everyone's Talking About The High-Frequency Trading Firm That Just Had 1 Day Of Trading Losses In 1238 Days
Steven Perlberg Mar 11, 2014, 06.16 PM
Continue reading
ZeroHedge is calling it the " holy grail " of trading.
In its IPO prospectus , High Frequency Trading firm Virtu reveals it had one losing trading day in 1,238 days of trading.
Just one.
HFT has become increasingly controversial in recent years, and this new IPO shines light on an otherwise secretive (and computerized) industry. Virtu is what's called a market maker. It doesn't hold onto securities for very long, but instead derives profit from bid/ask spreads.
High frequency trading is called "high frequency" for exactly that reason. This is all happening in a matter of milliseconds. Virtu and other HFT firms basically argue they are providing a public service by ensuring liquidity in the market " by consistently buying securities from sellers and selling securities to buyers," according to the prospectus.
Critics of HFT like ZeroHedge say that when your business model is to "scalp pennies from every market order - that would be billions of market orders in a period of four years - there is no risk."
Virtu is a New-York based firm famous for trying (and failing) to buy Knight Capital Group in 2012. But things are definitely going well for the HFT firm. Its founder and chief executive officer recently purchased the Florida Panthers hockey team .
"The chart below illustrates our daily Adjusted Net Trading Income from January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2013," Virtu writes in the filing. "As a result of our real-time risk management strategy and technology, we had only one losing trading day during the period depicted, a total of 1,238 trading days."

Virtu Financial, a high-frequency electronic trading firm and   market maker, filed on Monday with the SEC to raise up to $100   million in an initial public offering, although the deal   size is likely just a placeholder. We estimate it could raise as   much as $250 million. The New York , NY-based company, which   was founded in 2008 and booked $665 million in sales for the   fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, plans to list on the NASDAQ   under the symbol VIRT. Virtu Financial initially filed   confidentially on December 26, 2013. Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan,   Sandler O'Neill, Barclays, BMO Capital Markets, Citi, Credit   Suisse and UBS are the joint bookrunners on the deal. No pricing   terms were disclosed.

The average number of mortgage applications slid 2.1% on a seasonally adjusted basis as interest rates grew from the prior week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday.
Applications volume has dropped in three of the past four weeks according to MBA, as interest rates have generally ticked higher. That trend is a reversal from the beginning of the year, when lower interest rates led to modest growth in application volume.
On an unadjusted basis, the MBA said the market composite slipped 1% from a week earlier. The refinance index dropped 3%, while the seasonally adjusted purchase index fell 1%.
The average rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loans grew to 4.52% from 4.47% the previous week. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo-loan balances increased to 4.41% from 4.37%.
The average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration climbed to 4.18% from 4.13% the prior week.
The average rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 3.53% from 3.52%. The 5/1 ARM average increased to 3.18% from 3.09%.

According to Consumer Reports, approximately 70 percent of retirees  net wealth is locked up in their homes. Given that statistic, you d think that reverse mortgages would be a very popular solution for tapping into all that wealth. Yet prior to 2012, the cost, complexity and even stigma of a reverse mortgage have made it the choice of last resort for elderly retirees needing cash.
Things changed beginning in 2012, when the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures most reverse mortgages through its Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program, created the HECM Saver to lower costs and increase flexibility. Reverse mortgages are now being used not just as a last resort, but as one component of a comprehensive retirement plan.
Benefits
The key benefit of a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners ages 62 and older, is the ability to tap into a portion of your home s equity value without having to sell your home. You can withdraw a lump sum of money or create a line of credit similar to a home equity line (HELOC), from which you can draw cash when needed.
The amount you can borrow depends on your age (the older you are, the greater the amount), current interest rates and the value of your home.
FROM REVERSEMORTGAGEKDC.COM Nothing needs to be paid back to the lender as long as you or your spouse are alive and living in the home. After you pass away, your estate pays back the principal plus accrued interest to the lender, typically by selling the property. Any remaining equity goes to your heirs. The best part: If there s not enough equity in the property to cover the loan, the FHA pays the difference to the lender, preserving the remaining assets in the estate for your heirs.
The line of credit option has become the most popular choice, because it offers the most flexibility and incurs the lowest costs. As with a HELOC, if you don t borrow the money, you don t pay any interest. Unlike a HELOC, a HECM line of credit cannot be reduced or frozen, and the loan does not become due until your death. The HECM line of credit even grows as you become older, regardless of your home s value.
Reverse mortgages, however, don t come for free. There are closing costs and loan origination and servicing fees similar to what you d incur with a traditional mortgage, not to mention FHA insurance premiums to cover any lender losses from equity declines.
And, of course, there is the interest that you have to pay on the loan, which in the case of a line of credit is variable based on prevailing rates.
All these factors make reverse mortgages more expensive than traditional mortgages. None of these costs has to be paid out-of-pocket. Nonetheless, they do limit the amount you can borrow and also affect the amount of equity your heirs have to sacrifice when your house is eventually sold.
Some additional benefits of a HECM reverse mortgage:
  It s much easier to qualify for than a traditional mortgage.
  Mandatory independent counseling by a government-trained nonprofit agency before you can apply provides a measure of consumer education and protection.
  Your executor/trustee has up to one year to pay off the loan after repayment becomes due.
The drawbacks
There are downsides to a reverse mortgage as well.
  The loan can be called early due to nonpayment of property taxes, homeowners insurance or failure to adequately maintain the property, potentially forcing you to sell the house prematurely.
  Having extra money available (especially when taken as a lump sum) puts you at risk of spending it too quickly or becoming a target for financial abuse by family or financial advisers. That s why a reverse mortgage should never be used except as part of a well-thought-through retirement plan.
Alternatives
There are alternatives to a reverse mortgage if you want to access some of the equity built up in your home. The simplest is to downsize by selling your current home and either buying or renting a less expensive, smaller house. Alternatively, if your adult children have the financial wherewithal, you can create a sale-leaseback arrangement in which you sell the house to one (or more) of your children and then rent it back using the cash you get from the sale. Your children benefit by getting rental income and tax write-offs (as long as you structure the transaction properly, according to the IRS), and you get the cash. However, once the lease expires, your children have the right to kick you out. You may not be comfortable giving up that degree of control over your home.
A private reverse mortgage is another option. You ll benefit because your children will charge you less than commercial lenders, your up-front costs will be lower and there won t be ongoing mortgage-insurance expenses. Plus the interest rate   which the IRS sets each month   will be lower than what commercial lenders charge. But again, it s important to structure the deal so that it passes muster with the IRS.
Reverse mortgages have emerged as a viable retirement planning tool as long as they are used carefully and thoughtfully. The more tools we have, the better the likelihood that we can afford to do all the things in our later years that we d always hoped to do.

Refinancing Your ARM When It s About To Reset
ARMs Resetting To Highest Rate Since 2012
Is your adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) about to adjust? You may not want to allow it.
At current mortgage rates , today's ARMs are resetting near 3.50%, which is the highest since 2012. Today's adjusting ARM rates also end a 4-year streak during which resetting ARMs garnered lower rates than "new" ARMs on the open market.
For the last decade, it's paid to have an conventional adjustable rate mortgage. Today, not so much.
If you've been riding your ARM through its adjustments, you've benefitted from low rates. With market sentiment shifting, though, it's time to consider a refinancing into something different -- either a new ARM or a fixed-rate loan.
ARMs are expected to adjust higher through most of 2016 and into 2017 as well.
Click to see today's rates (Mar 16th, 2017)
How Does An Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM) Work?
An adjustable-rate mortgage is a mortgage for which the interest rate can change (i.e. adjust) over time based on "market conditions".
Sometimes, ARM mortgage rates adjust higher. Sometimes, ARM mortgage rates adjust lower. And, ARMs can be an excellent option for first-time home buyers .
However, ARM interest rates fluctuate for the homeowners who use them, ARMs carry a financial risk not present with fixed-rate loans. For example, when you use an ARM to finance your home, there is no way to know what your mortgage rate will be in 10 years.
Uncertainty can be frightening. It can be hugely rewarding, too.
Consider this: since 2003, nearly every U.S homeowner using a conventional ARM home loan "beat the bank" on their mortgage. This is because, between 2003 and late-2015, adjustable-rate mortgages adjusted below the rates you could get on a "brand-new" loan (and with no closing costs required!).
That streak ended in December 2015, though, when the Federal Reserve raised the Fed Funds Rate from its target range near zero. When the Fed raises the Fed Funds Rate, it can affect the drivers for an adjusting ARM.
As a quick refresher, here's how adjustable-rate mortgages work.
For a fixed period of time, usually 5 or 7 years, your mortgage rate is constant
When the fixed period ends, your rate adjusts according to a preset formula
Once annually thereafter, your rate adjusts using the same preset formula
The preset formula is a simple one. The new rate for the adjustable-rate mortgage is the sum of some variable market rate -- typically the 12-month LIBOR -- and a pre-determined constant, which is typically 2.25 percent.
Adding the constant and the variable shows your new rate. Today, that sum is (2.25) + (1.17), or 3.42%.
3.42% is a low mortgage rate, but it's higher than what you could get for a new 5-year ARM from an approved mortgage lender. According to Freddie Mac, new 5-year ARMs average 3.09 percent nationwide.
However, with a new ARM, there are closing costs to pay.
For example, in order to lock the 3.09% 5-year ARM rate shown by Freddie Mac, borrowers are expected to pay 0.5 discount points to the lender. And, closing costs apply, too.
If you prefer to let your loan adjust, you won't get access to the 3.09% rate -- but you won't be responsible for closing costs, either. This is because, with an adjusting loan, there are no appraisals, no verifications of your income, and no credit check required.
In addition, an adjusting loan requires no underwriting and no fees paid to title companies. You're not even required to have a job.
So, there are reasons to refinance away from your adjusting ARM, but allowing an adjustment can make sense to your cash flow, too.

Should You Refinance From ARM to Fixed?
If your current loan is an adjustable-rate mortgage and the loan is about to adjust, you have a decision to made as a homeowner -- should I let my ARM adjust or should I refinance it?
In all, there are three options for your adjusting ARM :
Do nothing. Let your loan adjust; revisit mortgage rates again next year
Refinance your ARM to a new ARM at today's ARM mortgage rates
Refinance your ARM to a new fixed rate loan at today's fixed rate pricing
Each option has merits.
If you allow your ARM to adjust (Option 1), your lender will assign a new mortgage rate based on today's LIBOR. Most homeowners will get a rate near 3.42% which will be assigned for the 12 months. The payment on a 3.42% mortgage rate is $445 for every $100,000 owed.
You can also refinance your ARM into new adjustable-rate loan.
Via a new ARM, you can lock your rate for the next 5 or 7 years or longer, depending on your needs. You'll postpone the adjustments of a recasting ARM and, according to Freddie Mac's most recent mortgage rate survey, will get an average rate of 3.09% for a 5-year ARM for an accompanying, one-time fee of 0.5 discount points.
The payment on a new ARM is $426 per $100,000, which saves $19 monthly but which is also subject to closing costs which could add up to the thousands, depending on in which state you live.
Lastly, you have the option of switching your ARM into a fixed-rate loan.
This is the most common way homeowners remove the uncertainty of "changing mortgage rates" and, according to quarterly refinance reports from the government, 66% of homeowners with ARMs make this choice.
Refinancing your ARM into a fixed-rate loan can be a good fit for several reasons -- especially if you expect that the economy will improve this year or next, and you plan to stay in your home for a few more years.
An improving economy moves LIBOR rates higher and LIBOR is the basis for your adjusted ARM mortgage rate. With a fixed-rate mortgage, you'll get a stable monthly because your interest rate is fixed and so is your payment.
The downside is that fixed-rate mortgages are roughly 100 basis points (1.00%) higher than comparable ARM mortgage rates, which means that your "stable payment" might be higher than your adjusted one.
What Are Today's Mortgage Rates?
For U.S. homeowners with adjusting adjustable-rate mortgages, the best "refinance move" may be to skip the refinance entirely. You'll have to compare mortgage rates and see what's best for you.

Mortgages are getting more expensive in San Antonio and in the entire country, as demand for homes begins to exceed supply and banks start offering mortgages to more applicants.
At the beginning of 2013, mortgage rates were at historic lows, with rates below 3.0% in some extreme cases. Then in the summer, mortgage rates began to rise across the country, exceeding 4.5% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, according to a survey by Freddie Mac.
Rates and Home Prices Are Increasing in San Antonio
In 2014, this increase has slowed down, even falling slightly to a low of 4.25% in early February. This tapering has been a beacon of hope for home buyers, especially in San Antonio, where home prices in December were 6 percent higher than the previous year. Worried that home prices might rise further and rates might continue to increase, more people have been looking to buy in the city. The trend can also be seen throughout much of Texas.
Rates will most likely continue to rise for a number of reasons. First, there is low inventory in the city and strong demand, which will translate to more demand for mortgages and higher rates. Additionally, U.S. Treasury rates, which the mortgage rate is based on, are likely to go up in 2014 as the general economy improves and the Federal Reserve slows its bond-buying program. Finally, banks are likely to start lending more, and that means they will focus on loans with higher interest rates, because they offer a higher profit.
A Growing City Means Increased Demand
San Antonio is likely to see higher-than-average increases in mortgage rates for one primary reason: it s growing. The city s labor market is stronger than many other parts of the country. This is causing the city s population and demand for housing to grow.
How high can interest rates go? While it s difficult to say, there is much room for growth. Historically, interest rates of 6.0% were considered a bargain, with rates of 8.0% and more considered the norm. Although it s unlikely that we ll see such rates anytime soon, rates are likely to remain above 4.0% and could possibly even reach 5.0% by the end of 2014, assuming that the job market improves, banks continue to loosen their credit standards, and we don t see another recession or global financial crisis.

Mortgage rates for 30-year fixed mortgages rose this week, with the current rate borrowers were quoted on Zillow Mortgage Marketplace at 4.21 percent, up from 4.11 percent at this same time last week. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate steadily rose last week, peaking at 4.27 percent on Monday before dropping slightly to today's rate. (The chart for the full week is below.)
"Rates rose on Monday to levels not seen since mid-January, as the situation in Ukraine appeared to improve and Friday's jobs report beat expectations," said Erin Lantz , director of mortgages at Zillow. "This week, we expect rates to remain fairly steady, unless the economic reports being released in the latter half of the week are strong enough to accelerate the gradual upward momentum we saw following last week's jobs report."
Additionally, the 15-year fixed mortgage rate this morning was 3.15 percent and for 5/1 ARMs , the rate was 2.74 percent.

11 Great Reasons to Carry a Big, Long Mortgage
Angela Deines; Angela Deines Special to The Capital-Journal
By Angela Deines; Angela Deines Special to The Capital-Journal
Proquest LLC
Choosing the type of loan that best fits your needs doesn't have to be complicated, as long as you provide your lender with all the most accurate and necessary financial information.
Before deciding what type of loan you want, think about your future.
- Will you be in the home for a long time? A loan with a lower monthly payment and a low, fixed interest rate may be the best for you.
- Do you want to have your home paid off before your children enter college or before you retire? Then a shorter term loan may be in your best interest but expect to have higher monthly payments.
With whatever type of loan you are thinking about, your lender can help you figure out what your monthly payments will be with a mortgage calculator.
Conventional loans: These are 5- to 50-year (although most are 15- and 30-year mortgages) fixed rate or Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) loans that require three to 20-percent of the purchase price as a down payment. These loans aren't backed by the U.S. government. Closing costs are paid for by the buyer or seller, depending on what is negotiated in the real estate contract.
These loans also require
Private Mortgage Insurance
(PMI) if you can't pay 20-percent of the purchase price upfront. The PMI allows the lender to be insured if the borrower defaults on the loan. The PMI payments are rolled into the monthly loan payment and you can request that it be discontinued once you have made the necessary payments to reduce the principal balance of your mortgage to 80- percent of the original value of your home and have made timely payments.
Federal Home Administration
(FHA)/
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) loans: These loans are provided by private lenders but backed by the U.S. government and require Mortgage Insurance Premiums. Similar to conventional loans, you are required to pay mortgage insurance premiums however FHA loans require an upfront premium collected at closing as well as a monthly premium for the life of the loan. If you default on your loan, the FHA reimburses the lender.
Your down payment on an FHA home can be as low as 3.5-percent of the purchase price, and most of your closing costs and fees can be included in the loan. FHA has a loan that allows you to buy a home, fix it up, and include all the costs in one loan.
People who can't obtain a conventional loan often can receive an FHA loan because of weak credit or the inability to make a down payment.
USDA
Rural Development
loans: These loans are backed by the U.S. government and are available for people purchasing a home in a rural area. In addition, a borrower has to be the primary occupant of the home and be a citizen of
the United States
or be admitted for permanent residency. Co-borrowers who aren't planning to occupy the home aren't permitted and borrowers must sell their existing home if they have one. Eligibility and adjusted income requirements apply. The adjusted income must not exceed 115% of the median household income for the area the home is located. Qualifying ratios and the applicant's stable and dependable income will determine home affordability.
No down payment for a
USDA Rural Development
loan is required and there is no maximum purchase price for the home. Fixed 30-year interest rates may apply to this kind of loan. Lenders and applicants agree upon the interest rate. Eligible closing costs and lender fees may be included in the loan or paid by the applicant. Eligible repairs and improvements may also be included in the loan.
Veterans Administration
(VA) loan: Are you a veteran? Chances are you qualify for a VA loan. These loans are provided by private lenders, such as banks and mortgage companies. The VA guarantees a portion of the loan, allowing the lender to provide you with more favorable terms. There is no down payment or monthly mortgage insurance required for a VA loan and there is no upper limit or required cap on the income of the borrower.
According to the
Veterans Administration
, you must have suitable credit, sufficient income, and a valid Certificate of Eligibility (COE) to be eligible for a VA-guaranteed home loan. The home must be for your own personal occupancy. Check with your lender or go to www.va.gov to find out what is required to obtain a Certificate of Eligibility.
First-Time Homebuyer Program in
:
The Kansas Housing Assistance Program
is offering grants of four percent for a down payment and closing costs on the purchase of a home for a first- time homebuyer or someone who hasn't owned a home in three years.
The grants for these loans don't have to be repaid and are given in conjunction with 30-year, fixed-rate high loan-to-value mortgage loans through FHA, VA and
USDA Rural Development
loans. To qualify, buyers must have a minimum credit score of 640 and an income limit of
$64,400
for a family of one or two and
$74,060
for a family of three or more.
The program is available for the purchase of a house, duplex, semi-detached home, condominium, townhouse, or qualified manufactured home on a permanent foundation. This program is a benefit for sellers as it stimulates the local housing market by allowing sellers to sell their home more quickly. For more information about this program, go to the
Kansas Housing Assistance Program's
website at www.kshap.org .
*Be sure to check with your lender to make sure you are aware of all the home loans that may be available to you. Ask as many questions as possible and understand that you may not qualify for the first kind of loan you may want, depending on your credit history and other factors.

This Tuesday, the interested customers can see the benchmark 30 year fixed mortgage interest rates hanging around the same spot as yesterday, which will certainly help the bank to maintain a steady demand for its loan products in the market.
In the standard, long term home loan section, the bank has listed the 30 year fixed rate mortgage home loans against an interest rate of 4.500% and an APR yield of 4.564% today. However, for the borrowers interested in taking the shorter route, the bank is currently offering its 15 year fixed rate mortgages at a lending rate of 3.625% and an APR yield of 3.789% on the second day of the trading week.
The mortgage shoppers, who are looking forward to secure ideal home loans and enjoy more flexibility in terms of interest rates, the 5 adjustable rate mortgage deals would be an ideal pick at a starting interest rate of 3.375% and an APR yield of 3.056% to begin with. However, the more flexible, 7 year adjustable rate mortgage home loans can be secured at an interest cost of 3.625% and an annual return rate of 3.225% during the starting years of the home loan tenure.
The eligible borrowers, who are looking forward to refinance their existing investments, can opt for the popular 30 year refinancing fixed rate mortgage home loan deals, which are now being traded at an interest rate of 4.500% and are backed by an APR yield of 4.575%. However, the relatively shorter, 15 year refinancing fixed rate home loan plans are now tagged at an interest price of 3.500% and offering an APR yield of 3.646% this Tuesday.
As far as the adjustable rate mortgage home financing options are considered, the 5 year refinancing variable rate home loan deals can be seen coming out at a starting rate of 3.125% today and an APR yield of 2.968%. On the other hand, the more flexible, 7 year adjustable rate mortgage home loan schemes can be locked in at an interest rate of 3.500% and an annual percentage rate of 3.166% on the initial amount of home loan secured from the bank.

GM records show ignition problems surfaced in 2001

WASHINGTON (Detroit Free Press) -- An internal analysis of General Motors' records found reports of ignition switch problems in certain car models dating back to 2001, potentially raising deeper questions about why it took the automaker so long to initiate a recall.Reports from GM required by federal regulators were posted on a government website late Wednesday. Those showed that only additional analysis done early this year led the company to add several models to the recall, which now affects 1.6 million vehicles worldwide and 1.37 million in the U.S.
Those reports were made public as auto safety experts urged GM to waive the legal immunity dating to its bankruptcy that protects it from lawsuits arising from crashes before July 2009. At least 12 people died in 31 crashes linked to the defect. At least five of those deaths occurred in accidents before GM exited bankruptcy, according to a Free Press review of documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Federal regulators, congressional investigators and the U.S. Justice Department have initiated probes into why it took GM as long as it did to recall 2005-7 Chevrolet Cobalts, 2003-7 Saturn Ions, 2006-7 Pontiac Solstices and several other vehicles. As early as 2007, regulators informed GM of a possible problem with the ignition switch being jostled into a position where power was cut off and airbags were disabled.
But evidence of a problem may have existed even earlier. A review of reports from as far back as 2001 mentioned issues related to ignition switches in affected vehicles.
One, from 2003, "documented an instance in which the service technician observed a stall while driving," and said the weight of key chains had worn out the ignition switch.
Dealers are being told to replace the ignition switch. New CEO Mary Barra has said she is personally leading efforts to address the recall that has mushroomed into GM's biggest crisis since it came out of bankruptcy in July 2009.
Notices went out to owners this week. Prior to Wednesday night's posting, it was believed the first notice to GM of an ignition switch being jostled from position was in 2004. At that time, a tracking inquiry and solutions were considered, but the inquiry was closed, the company said, "after consideration of the lead time required, cost and effectiveness of each of these solutions."
In the new timeline of events dating back to 2005 and posted on NHTSA's website Wednesday. GM acknowledged its Executive Field Action Decision Committee   which initiated the recall   had not been initially asked to consider recalling the Ion, HHR, Solstice and Sky.
Early this year, the internal review, which began in 2007, was expanded to consider those models "because these vehicles were equipped with the same ignition switch" as the Cobalts and Pontiac G5s which were being examined, Gm said in the new filing.
But the review didn't include some vehicles such as the Saturn Ion, in which airbags did not deploy during crashes. It wasn't until last year that the company review determined that an ignition part in the early models that did not meet GM specifications was changed after 2010. That change "increased the switch's torque performance." Delphi provided the original switches   but it was not immediately clear from the report whether it or another supplier made the later change.
Still, unless GM agrees to waive its defense to claims prior to July 2009, many potential lawsuits could be precluded, even if a driver or passenger died.
Clarence Ditlow, who runs the Center for Auto Safety, and Joan Claybrook, a former head of NHTSA, signed a letter to Barra on Wednesday asking GM to set up a $1-billion fund "to cover losses of victims and families of safety defects whose claims have been extinguished by the bankruptcy or barred by statues of repose or limitations."
The company responded by saying it is "focused on ensuring the safety and peace of mind of our customers involved in the recall." It did not directly address the government-granted immunity.
"It is true that new GM did not assume liability for claims arising from incidents or accidents occurring prior to July 2009. Our principle throughout this process has been to the put the customer first, and that will continue to guide us," GM's statement concluded.
There's no way of knowing whether the solutions previously considered by GM -- or the ones being put into effect now   might have prevented any of the 12 fatalities, which happened during crashes that may have been unrelated to the ignition switch defect itself.
"Only GM knows which of the death and injury claims on the Cobalt and other recalled vehicles are due to the ignition key defect. But it's far more" than reported so far, said Ditlow and Claybrook, who is on the board of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy organization.
The family of Brooke Melton, 29, who died in a 2010 crash in a 2005 Cobalt, were not affected by GM's liability shield. They sued and settled with GM in a confidential agreement. But the Melton family's lawyer, Lance Cooper of Marietta, Ga., said GM still needs to take corrective action for what he called a corporate cover-up of a problem it was well aware of.
"Instead of recalling their product, they started paying the claims, which is outrageous," Cooper said, adding that waiving the liability protection "would be a good step in the right direction."
Also on Wednesday, a U.S. Senate subcommittee announced it will hold a hearing sometime in April, joining a House committee that has launched an investigation. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York has also opened an inquiry into whether GM may have violated any criminal statutes in the reporting of the defect and its consequences.
"We have to get to the bottom of this," said Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., chairman of the subcommittee on consumer protection. "We need to find out who dropped the ball and put millions of Americans at risk. We also need to make sure that General Motors and federal regulators are doing everything they can to prevent more tragedies like this now and in the future."

General Motors recall of Chevrolet Colbalts and Certain Pontiac Vehicles
Posted by Jamie Sheller
Tweet
On Feb. 13, 2014, General  Motors (GM) recalled 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and certain Pontiac vehicles to repair an ignition switch problem that can allow the key to unintentionally slip from its  run  position when the car hits a bump or if the keychain is too heavy. As a result, the defect can cause an engine shutdown and loss of power steering, brakes, and safety systems, including its airbags and anti-lock brakes.
On Feb. 25, GM expanded the recall to include hundreds of thousands of additional Chevy, Pontiac, and Saturn cars, bringing the total number of affected vehicles to 1.4 million.
GM has linked the defect to 31 crashes involving airbags that failed to deploy and the deaths of 13 motorists.
Depositions taken during a civil lawsuit against GM revealed the auto maker knew in 2004, a decade before it issued a recall, that its Chevrolet Cobalt had an ignition switch that could inadvertently shut off the engine while driving.
According to news reports Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney s Office in New York has opened a criminal probe into the circumstances surrounding the GM ignition switch recall.
I would like to talk to you about any cases involving serious injuries or deaths resulting from crashes involving the 2005-2007 Chevy Cobalt, or model year 2003-2007 Pontiac G5, Saturn Ion, Chevy HHR, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky

Criminal Probe Surrounding GM Recall
Posted by Eric T. Chaffin

Federal prosecutors are investigating General Motors  alleged failure to notify consumers of deadly safety problems long before issuing a recall. On March 10, 2014, a U.S. Congressional Committee also announced plans to investigate what led to GM s recall of over one-million vehicles due to faulty ignition switches.
GM Issues Expanded Recall Due to Faulty Ignition Switch
On February 13, 2014, General Motors initially recalled 778,562 older-model Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 compact cars in North America due to an ignition issue impacting model years 2005-2007. The company found that road conditions, weight on the key ring, or even some jarring events, might cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position which in turn would turn off the engine and electrical components in the car, including airbags.
At this time, GM allegedly knew of 5 frontal-impact crashes and 6 front-seat fatalities where the vehicles  front airbags did not deploy. But, according to a company spokesperson, these crashes all involved high rates of speed and were off-road. There were also 17 other crashes reported that involved airbags not deploying.
GM recommended that drivers remove any items that could weigh down their key rings until the fix was made.
On February 25, 2014 , GM expanded its recall of 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalts, Pontiac G5 and Pontiac Pursuits sold in Canada only to include 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice, and 2007 Saturn Sky models. This recall affected over 1 million vehicles in the United States. About 31 crashes, including 13 front-seat fatalities, were linked to the faulty ignition switches.
GM Allegedly Delayed Issuing Recall
General Motors allegedly told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it has known about the faulty ignition problem for 10 years . Automakers have 5 days after learning about a safety defect to contact the NHTSA.
GM claims the delay was due to   a series of internal miscues .  At the time these serious defects were discovered in 2004, the automaker launched an internal investigation, but nothing was done.
GM CEO Mary Barra, who took on the position in January, supported the Company s recall in a letter issued on March 4, 2014, stating GM acted  without hesitation. 
GM has hired its own attorneys to investigate the recall.
If your vehicle is part of this expansive recall, you should see your auto dealer immediately to get your vehicle fixed.

Why hang safety entirely on an ignition switch?
GM and other car companies should delay the time between the ignition switch shut off and the cutoff of power to the steering, the brakes, the airbags and the entire electronic monitoring system.
Moreover, if the car is moving, power cutoff time should be delayed further to give the driver a chance to safely pull off the road   or turn the ignition back on.
Electric powered systems are safe and the way of the future.
And they don t need to be shut off as soon as the ignition goes off.
What s the hurry, anyway?

The GM Scandal Only Gets Worse
March 13th, 2014,  6:12 AM
The public relations disaster for General Motors seems to be getting worse by the day.
Danielle Ivory of The New York Times writes that GM admitted on Wednesday that it had received reports of safety defects in cars linked to 12 deaths and at least 31 accident in 2001, not 2004 as previously disclosed.
The Times reports:
In an expanded chronology of events filed with federal safety regulators about the recall of 1.6 million cars, the automaker said that during the development of the Saturn Ion in 2001 it had found that the ignition switch could turn off easily, but that a design change  had resolved the problem. 
Then, in 2003, an internal inquiry said that a service technician observed the car stall after the ignition had switched off while driving. After seeing that a heavy key ring had worn out the switch, the technician replaced it, the chronology said, and the inquiry was then closed. (In documents released on Tuesday, G.M. lowered the number of deaths tied to the faulty switch to 12 from 13, saying it had mistakenly counted one fatality twice.)

General Motors will offer $500 rebates to owners of the 1.37 million cars that it has  recalled over a faulty ignition switch, according to the Detroit Free Press . The rebate will be good through April 30th and can be used towards the purchase of any 2013, 2014 or 2015 Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick, or GMC vehicle.
 In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall, a special $500 cash allowance is available to purchase or lease a new GM vehicle,  said GM spokesman Alan Adler.  We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance. 
Dealers were notified of the rebate in a March 5th memo from GM, which also provided guidance on how to answer questions and concerns about the recall. The letter has since been posted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration s website.
GM is not suggesting owners of the affected cars buy a new vehicle to remedy the problem, the Free Press reports. Instead, the rebates are being offered as validation to GM s commitment to customer service.
 This special cash allowance must be passed on to the eligible customer at the time of the transaction and is in addition to other national and regional offers,  the letter reads.  And is intended to assist those customers who are unhappy and may want to trade out of their vehicle or buy a new GM product. 
The letter also informed owners that parts for the ignition repairs will be available in April, and included instructions on how to request reimbursement for ignition switch repairs they have paid for in the past. If the ignition switch has been replaced in the past, it still needs to be replaced again as part of this recall.
In addition, GM is offering courtesy vehicles to those owners afraid to drive their vehicles, and will cover the towing costs for affected vehicles as well as the fees for rental vehicles.

UPDATED 18:12 EST . 12 MARCH 2014 2 MIN READ
No doubt there are numerous factors that led to the current General Motors recall debacle. But one of them is certainly poor data analytics.
According to media reports, since 2003 General Motors received over 250 complaints related to an ignition defect that caused a number of vehicles to stall while traveling at high rates of speed. Twelve deaths and 31 crashes have thus far been linked to the defect. Despite having invested in  a number of tools and techniques to gather and analyze data [to] look for trends that warrant a vehicle safety investigation and possibly a recall,  as General Motors said in a statement, the car manufacturer failed to identify the severity of the ignition defect until just last month.
General Motors points out the 250 or so complaints it received over the course of a decade represents just .018 percent of the vehicles involved in the current recall. For sure, identifying the ignition defect based on just 250 complaints would be akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Consider that the company, having significantly recovered from its 2009 bankruptcy filing, sold 2.7 million cars in 2013 alone. The company receives millions of complaints per year from car dealers and direct from customers.
Unfortunately for General Motors, finding such a needle in a haystack is its responsibility. The Tread Act of 2000, which was passed in the wake of the Firestone tire recall, required car manufacturers to take steps to significantly improve their data analysis capabilities to better identify serious product defects to prevent situations such as General Motors and its effected customers find themselves in now.  Whatever data analysis tools and technologies the company invested in, clearly they need to do more.
But let s not let the government off the hook. The Tread Act also required the National Highway and Transportation Safety Administration to improve its analytics capabilities, as many customers report defective cars to both manufacturers and the NHTSA. That was indeed the case in the current situation.
 We took several efforts to look into this data,  said David Friedman, acting administrator for NHTSA, earlier this week in an interview with Bloomberg BusinessWeek .  At the end of the day, with the data we had at that time, we didn t think that was sufficient to open up a formal investigation. 
In other words, the NHTSA had the data they needed, just not the tools and/or the know-how to analyze it. Same goes for General Motors.

Posted: Wed 11:27 PM, Mar 12, 2014
DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors excluded the Saturn Ion from a Feb. 13 recall for faulty ignition switches after engineers inexplicably failed to look at fatal crashes involving the compact car.
The Ion was recalled two weeks later, after another inquiry found four crashes involving 2004 Ions that killed four people. The omission was revealed in a GM recall chronology released by U.S. safety regulators Wednesday night.
According to the chronology, GM employees were told about most of the Ion crash deaths within two weeks of when they occurred. So GM knew about the deaths but didn't consider them until this year.
The exclusion of the deaths will likely be scrutinized by two congressional committees and the Justice Department, which are investigating why it took so long for GM to recall the cars.

GM says ignition-switch troubles surfaced in 2001 testing
Thursday March 13, 2014
Print Article
General Motors Co told US regulators it first knew about ignition-switch problems in small cars in 2001.   Reuters picDETROIT, March 13   General Motors Co got its first internal report on ignition-switch problems in small cars in 2001, while developing the Saturn Ion, the carmaker said in a letter to US regulators.
GM thought it had fixed the ignition-switch defect, the carmaker said in a supplemental report filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration yesterday. Then in 2003, service technicians found that an owner with a heavy key ring was experiencing engine stalls while driving. The flaw, linked to 12 deaths, led to the recall last month of 1.6 million cars.
The company filed the new information with NHTSA on what it did to address the problem to better explain why it expanded the recall to six US models from two, roughly doubling the number of cars covered, Greg Martin, a spokesman for Detroit-based GM, said in an e-mail. The details concern the company s attempts to investigate ignition-switch issues in the Ion, the Saturn Sky, the Chevrolet HHR and the Pontiac Solstice.
 Today s GM is fully committed to learning from the past while embracing the highest standards for quality and performance now and in the future,  Martin said.
GM later used the same part in the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.
The 2001 testing failure disclosed by GM is earlier than when the carmaker said it learned of flaws in the Cobalt. Previously, the company said it had investigated in 2004 a consumer complaint and engineers were able to induce an engine stall. GM officials have said the problem was investigated at that time and no action was taken.
Frontal crashes
 We don t yet really know at what point this matter was escalated to past upper-level members of management, and how they dealt with it,  said Alec Gutierrez, a senior analyst at Kelley Blue Book in Irvine, California.  It s also murky as to when current management learned about some of this. 
The flaw caused ignition switches to slip out of position and cut off engine power and deactivate air bags.
The largest US automaker said it knows of eight frontal- impact crashes and four deaths involving Ions that may be linked to the defect. It knows of three frontal crashes involving the HHR that may be related, which caused three injuries but no fatalities, it said.
The recalled cars are the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevy HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice, 2007 Saturn Sky, 2007 Pontiac G5   all US models   plus the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit marketed in Canada and the 2007 Open GT in Europe.
GM fell less than 1 per cent to US$34.86 (RM114.38) at 4pm in New York. On Tuesday the shares tumbled 5.1 per cent, their worst one- day drop since March 2012, cutting the company s market value by more than US$3 billion.
 The difference between 10 or 12 years, if I m a consumer, doesn t make me feel any better or any worse, necessarily, about what happened,  Kelley Blue Book s Gutierrez said of the evolving timeline.  What s important for consumers at this point is what GM is doing to make it right.    Bloomberg

View this story.
In February, the automaker recalled more than 1.5 million vehicles for a faulty ignition switch linked to 13 deaths.
Vehicles on the GM recall list include 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006 and 2007 Chevy HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Sky, 2005-2007 Chevy Cobalt and 2007 Pontiac G5S.
The company first learned of the problem a decade earlier.
When CBS News aired its first investigative report into the problem, Vicki Harrington said she was scared. Two teenage girls were killed when a Chevrolet Cobalt went off the road in 2006. For Harrington, a mother from West Des Moines, the similarities between the crash and her daughter s vehicle were startling.
 It was a 2005 Cobalt that they were driving, and hers is a 2006,  she said.
Her daughter, Katie, has been driving a Chevy Cobalt for about six years. A few weeks ago she attempted to get its ignition fixed at an authorized GM dealership. However, the dealership told her its hands were tied and offered no solutions.
GM is offering free loaner vehicles while it waits for parts to arrive for repairs or $500 toward the purchase of a new car.
GM dealerships across the metro would not respond to requests for comment on how many drivers the recall affected.
 Sometimes they don t think it s significant enough or it s not enough vehicles having the problem,  said local mechanic John Merriam.
A faulty ignition switch can cause the engine to shut down and disable airbags.
GM indicated Wednesday that it knows of 31 crashes and 13 deaths that resulted from recalled vehicles, leaving Harrington looking elsewhere for her daughter s next car.
 The way they ve handled this whole situation has just been completely unacceptable,  Harrington said.

UPDATE 3-GM waited on Ion recall despite awareness of fatal crashes
FULL COVERAGE:
* U.S. Senate announces its own probe of GM, NHTSA over recall
* Senate, House say criminal investigation could complicate their probes
* Faulty ignition switches linked to 12 deaths
* Hit to GM stock "overdone" -analyst
By Ben Klayman, Richard Cowan and Paul Lienert
DETROIT/WASHINGTON, March 12 General Motors Co  waited more than two weeks to expand a major recall to include the Saturn Ion and other compact cars, even though its engineers were aware of four fatalities in crashes involving the model, GM said in filings published on Wednesday.
In an amended submission to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, GM also said it had identified an issue with the ignition switch, the central failing in the recall of more than 1.6 million cars, in 2001 preproduction testing on the Ion.
That is three years earlier than the company previously had reported. Before Wednesday, GM had said that it became aware of the problem in 2004, in the Chevrolet Cobalt.
GM says the switch has been connected with at least 34 crashes and is linked to at least 12 deaths. Congress, regulators and GM itself are investigating why it took the company so long to recall the cars.
GM issued its first recall of more than 600,000 Chevrolet Cobalts on Feb 7 of this year. On Feb 25 it expanded the recall by nearly 750,000 vehicles to include the Ion and several other compact models that shared the faulty ignition switch that could cause the engine to shut down and disable the airbags, sometimes at high speed.
Asked why GM had waited before expanding the recall, a  spokesman on Wednesday told Reuters the company had decided to conduct a "more in-depth analysis" of vehicles listed in previous communications with car dealers. That led to the second round of the recall.
A GM document released earlier on Wednesday said that even after the vehicles in its ignition-switch recall are repaired, owners should avoid weighing down their key rings with anything more than the key and fob.
Also on Wednesday, U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill said a Senate subcommittee plans to hold a hearing in early April on GM's recall.
"We have to get to the bottom of this," said McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. "We need to find out who dropped ball and put millions of Americans at risk."
The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.
GM said in an earlier filing Wednesday that it will offer loaner cars in some cases to unhappy owners affected by the recall.
The company also said it is not buying back affected vehicles if owners ask for that, but is offering a $500 cash allowance, through April 30, to buy a 2013, 2014 or 2015 model-year vehicle.
On Tuesday, a source said federal prosecutors have opened a probe of GM, examining whether the company is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that led to the recall.
PARALLEL PROBES
The New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved in the probe, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
The federal probe by the FBI and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall.
McCaskill said the Senate Commerce Committee's consumer protection subcommittee will examine the responses of GM and the federal traffic safety administration, NHTSA to the discovery of faulty ignition switches. She told Reuters that the congressional probe is "more challenging" now that the Justice Department also has opened its own investigation.
"While we would like to get as much information as possible and have General Motors as witnesses," McCaskill said her panel's review is "really about how NHTSA has handled this and what are the challenges that NHTSA faces in being an effective cop on the beat."
She said she has concerns about whether NHTSA had insufficient expertise and also about a lack of transparency at the agency. She did not know which GM executives would be called to testify.
Safety advocates have criticized NHTSA for failing to catch the GM issue and failing to demand a recall despite tracking the problems at different points over the past decade.
Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said NHTSA's lack of action suggests the agency's own review process may be ineffective despite changes made after the high-profile Ford-Firestone tire recall in 2000.
However, NHTSA's chief said U.S. auto-safety regulators did not force GM to recall the cars sooner because the connection between defective ignition switches and failing airbags was not clear.
"If we had that information, if GM had provided us with timely information, we would have been able to take a different course with this," David Friedman, acting administrator for NHTSA, told Bloomberg on Wednesday in Washington.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters in Washington on Wednesday that he had a "high level of confidence" in NHTSA, "but we'll continue watching as facts unfold and see where we are."
Foxx said his department is having a "dialogue" with the U.S. Department of Justice about the GM recall. "They're looking at the same information we're looking at. They will make that determination."
The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also has ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about the automaker's ignition-switch problems. A House committee aide said on Wednesday that while the Justice probe may complicate what information can be received, the committee expects NHTSA and GM to comply with information requests.
GM has declined to comment on news of the criminal probe, but has said it is cooperating on all the various probes.
"We are fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the Congress, too," GM spokesman Greg Martin said in an email on Wednesday. "We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts."
GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from NHTSA, and several analysts have estimated the recall could cost the company $70 million to $280 million.
The automaker has not disclosed what the recall will cost.   Analysts agreed that the biggest costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.
Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note that Tuesday's 5 percent stock decline was "overdone" as the $3.2 billion hit to the company's market cap was likely well above any potential settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and plaintiffs' lawyers.
However, Johnson added that it was unclear what might make the stock rise in coming months as continued media headlines were likely to weigh heavily on GM shares.
GM shares fell 0.9 percent to close at $34.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, NHTSA, the U.S. Transportation Department s auto safety regulator, continued to come under criticism by lawmakers in Washington.
Senator Patty Murray, chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, asked whether auto manufacturers take seriously existing laws that require early reporting, as well as the Transportation Department s administration of them.
 It raises a lot of questions why it took almost a decade for the automaker to report a serious defect,  the Washington state Democrat said at a hearing with Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx today.
Getting Tough
Foxx reiterated comments acting NHTSA Administrator David Friedman said yesterday, that more information from GM earlier in the process would have  changed the outcome.  Three crash investigations in cars that would later have been covered by the recall were inconclusive, he said.
 We will be very, very tough when we find timeliness has been a problem,  Foxx said.
The agency is still in the early stages of fact-finding in an inquiry into whether GM acted quickly enough once it was clear there was a safety-related defect.
The largest U.S. automaker said it knows of eight frontal-impact crashes and four deaths involving Ions that may be linked to the defect. It knows of three frontal crashes involving the HHR that may be related, which caused three injuries but no fatalities, it said.

GM recall: Questions and answers about recall of 1.6M vehicles
The Associated Press
Published Wednesday, March 12, 2014 8:49AM EDT
DETROIT -- General Motors' executives and government regulators will soon have to explain to Congress why it took years to recall 1.6 million compact cars with a known defect linked to 13 deaths. And the Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Members of two congressional committees will likely ask why a proposed fix to the problem was never implemented and why GM didn't immediately tell car owners about the defect. Here's a look at the developments so far in the recall and what's ahead.
Q. Which cars is GM recalling?
A. GM is recalling a total of 1.6 million vehicles that were sold in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The recall includes the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 from the 2005-2007 model years; the Saturn Ion from the 2003-2007 model years; and the Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky from the 2006-2007 model years.
Q. What's the defect?
A. GM says a heavy key ring or jarring from rough roads can cause the ignition switch to move out of the run position and shut off the engine and electrical power. That can knock out power-assisted brakes and steering and disable the front air bags.
Q. What is GM doing to fix the problem?
A. Dealers will replace the ignition switches for free. GM will notify owners when the parts are available and repairs can begin, likely in April. Until then, it is warning owners to remove all items from their key rings, including key fobs if applicable. Only the vehicle key should be left on the ring.
Q. Have any deaths or accidents been linked to this defect?
A. The problem has been linked to 31 crashes and 13 front-seat deaths. In each of the fatal crashes, the air bags did not inflate. The engines did not shut off in all cases.
Q. When did GM first know about this problem?
In 2004, around the time that the Chevrolet Cobalt first went on sale, GM learned of at least one engine losing power and started investigating the problem. By 2007, it had received more reports, including at least one involving a fatal accident. According to a company timeline that was given to NHTSA, the company approved a redesign of the key head in 2005 but later cancelled that plan. The company also alerted dealers that an insert on the key head could fix the problem, but warranty records show only 474 customers have gotten the insert.
Q. Why didn't GM act more quickly?
A. GM opened at least two investigations after reports of engine stalling but closed them after taking no action. At the time, the company was juggling eight U.S. brands and losing billions each year, which led to its eventual bankruptcy in 2009. Now, GM has cut excess brands and bureaucracy and is solidly profitable. GM's new CEO has promised "an unvarnished" investigation into what happened.
Q. Did GM report these incidents to the government?
A. Yes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also received dozens of complaints from owners about the issue, dating as far back as 2005. NHTSA conducted several investigations into the problem but never ordered a recall.
Q. Why is Congress investigating?
A. Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wrote a 2000 law that was intended to improve communication between automakers and NHTSA and help NHTSA identify potential threats to consumers' safety. He wants to know if GM or NHTSA missed opportunities to fix the problem sooner, or if the legislation needs to be strengthened.
Q. What actions can the government take if it finds GM didn't act quickly enough?
A. NHTSA can fine GM up to $35 million. Automakers are required to report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them. Congress doubled the maximum fine to $35 million last year and could increase it further.
Q. What's at stake for GM?
A. It's unclear how much the recall will cost. Toyota Motor Corp. paid $48.8 million in total fines to the U.S. government for its handling of unintended acceleration recalls. It later paid more than $1 billion to settle a lawsuit from owners claiming their cars lost value. It still faces other lawsuits.
The case will also hurt GM's efforts to break from its pre-bankruptcy past. Older, less reliable products still on the road could still haunt GM.
Q. Where can I get more information?
Owners may contact Chevrolet at 1-800-222-1020, Pontiac at 1-800-762-2737 or Saturn at 1-800-553-6000. They may also contact NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY 1-800-424-9153) or go to www.safercar.gov .

General Motors Co. now says it may have known about problems with its ignition switches dating back to 2001 when it was developing but had not yet launched the Saturn Ion.
In documents disclosed to federal regulators, GM said it had found some sort of issue contributing to the ignition's inner workings which have now been linked to a recall of 1.6 million vehicles and 12 deaths.
The auto maker said an ignition switch design change had resolved the problem. However, a service technician at an unnamed dealership observed the Ion stall while driving. In a report, it was noted that the owner "had several keys on the key ring" and that the additional weight of the keys had "worn out the ignition switch."
The service technician replaced the switch and the report was closed. GM went on to say there were other reports of complaints from customers not able to start their Ion engines. The auto maker declined to offer details.
GM disclosed the findings in its updated chronology of events that led to the February recall of millions of vehicles submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday. NHTSA posted the information on its website Wednesday.
Originally, the first reports of ignition switch problems and stalling centered around the launch of the Chevrolet Cobalt in 2004.
The component at the heart of the recall costs a few dollars to make and minutes to install, according to its manufacturer, auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive PLC, which could provoke more questions about why the problem wasn't fixed years ago.
Delphi told Wall Street analysts this week it expects to spend between $2 to $5 to produce a replacement ignition switch that can then be "swapped out" in a matter of minutes by mechanics at GM dealerships. The figure was reported in a research note written by JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, who was among a group of analysts who met with Delphi leaders.
Delphi, which manufactured the original switch, corroborated the report but offered no additional comment.
The figure suggests GM may spend about $8 million on replacement switches, while also keeping dealership labor costs in check.
GM faces multiple investigations--including a federal criminal probe--aimed at determining why the auto maker didn't act sooner to fix the faulty ignition switches.
"We have to get to the bottom of this," said Sen. Claire McCaskill, (D.-Mo.), chairman of the subcommittee on consumer protection, who said she would hold a hearing in April concerning the GM recall. "We need to find out who dropped the ball and put millions of Americans at risk."
GM has said its employees learned of an incident in 2004 in which a Cobalt lost engine power after the ignition key was jarred out of the "on" position, disabling the car's air bags. The car was about to be launched at the time. GM employees replicated the problem in test drives, according to documents submitted to safety regulators by GM.
An engineering inquiry was opened but later closed "after consideration of the lead time required, cost and effectiveness' of the solution offered by GM engineers," according to GM.
It wouldn't be until sometime during the 2007 model year of the Chevrolet Cobalt that the ignition switch was redesigned. But GM didn't recall the Cobalts or other cars with similar ignition locks until last month.
The problem occurred when drivers would turn the key from the "off" position, through the "accessory" position to the "on" position. However, the switch's detent plunger and spring inside allowed the ignition switch to turn back to the "accessory" position when the key was either bumped or there was too much weight hanging from the key's head.
GM declined to comment on the timeline and the switch issue beyond the documentation it has already submitted to the NHTSA.
Separately, GM said Wednesday it has authorized U.S. dealers to give any owner of a car covered in the recall, and unhappy with the vehicle, a $500 cash allowance to buy or lease a new GM product. The allowance is available through April 30 and can be used on a new 2013, 2014 or 2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac.
"In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall, a special, $500 cash allowance is available to purchase or lease a new GM vehicle," spokesman Greg Martin said. "We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM, nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance."
The issue of the cost of the ignition switches and the delays in replacing them will likely be just one facet of the investigations under way. The U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York has begun looking into the auto maker's handling of complaints about faulty ignition switches. The probe is at a preliminary stage. The House Energy and Commerce Committee also said it would investigate the case and hold hearings.
The auto maker is also facing an April 3 deadline in answering 107 questions posed by NHTSA concerning GM's timeline on the events leading to the recall. NHTSA is trying to decide if GM was noncompliant in the time it took to initiate the recall.
Meanwhile, owners of the vehicles can't get their cars repaired until April, when GM plans to begin repairing switches in 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, the 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and the 2007 Saturn Sky.
GM is taking steps to reassure consumers and regulators that it now is committed to addressing the problem. The auto maker earlier this week said Chicago attorney Anton Valukas, who served as the examiner of the downfall of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., will help lead an internal probe of the handling of the ignition-switch recall.
Morningstar Inc. senior equity analyst David Whiston, along with JP Morgan's Mr. Brinkman, said the company is likely to shake off any short-term market-share loss.
"The company may well lose sales in the short run because of constant negative headlines, but the impact to its reputation depends on how Chief Executive Mary Barra and her team respond over the next few months, " Mr. Whiston said in a research note. "We expect GM will continue to take responsibility and admit fault in how it handled the process."
The not-for-profit Center for Auto Safety on Wednesday called on GM to establish a $1 billion victims fund and asked the auto maker to waive immunity it received under its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring from most lawsuits.
A GM spokesman had no comment.

  The GM Recall
WASHINGTON -- General Motors said it saw signs of flimsy ignition switches  in the Saturn Ion as early as 2001, three years earlier than the first indications of a defect previously disclosed by the automaker.
According to GM s filing on Wednesday with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, GM received a report on the "passlock" system for the Saturn Ion's ignition switch in 2001, during pre-production development of the car. The chronology was released to explain a second batch vehicles recalled globally last month.
The report said the ignition switch s problem was "low detent plunger force," but a change in the design of the ignition switch resolved the problems. GM engineers and outside investigators would later find a similar problem with a Delphi-supplied ignition switch used in 1.6 million vehicles between model years 2003 and 2007.
The problem was fixed when Delphi began using a different detent plunger and spring to increase the torque in the switch.
In a 2003 report, a service technician observed that a car had stalled while driving, and noted that "[t]he owner had several keys on the key ring," and suggested that "[t]he additional weight of the keys had worn out the ignition switch."
In its previous filings with NHTSA, the first warning sign that GM disclosed came in 2004, around the time the Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale.
The fact that ignition switch problems with the Saturn Ion predate problems with the Chevrolet Cobalt also raises questions about why GM did not recall the Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice, Saturn Ion and Saturn Sky at the same time as the Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.
GM recalled U.S. cars in two batches: the Cobalt and G5 on Feb. 13, and the rest on Feb. 25.
GM now is telling drivers to remove all items from their key ring besides the ignition key until the repairs are completed, and that even afterward they should not put anything but the car's key fob back onto the ring.

Did GM violate law requiring it notify federal officials about defect in cars?
Email
The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York have opened a criminal investigation of General Motors over the company's handling of an ignition switch defect that's been linked to at least 12 deaths.
One possible issue: Did GM violate a law that requires car makers to give the federal government timely notice of defects?
When Michigan Rep. Fred Upton authored the Tread Act 14 years ago, it was after certain Firestone tires on Ford Explorers caused accidents that killed nearly 300 people.
General Motors knew about a problem with ignition switches in Cobalts and other compact cars
CBS News
The Tread Act gave manufacturers five days to report defects related to deaths and injuries to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They're called early warning reports.
"The law said five days, not five years, not 10 years, and we're going to find out why the law may not have worked the way that it was intended," Upton said.

General Motors  scramble might be comical, if it weren t so deadly serious for so many people. The automaker s focus now is to convince customers, regulators and lawmakers that it s responding as quickly as possible after recalling 1.6 million vehicles linked to more than a dozen deaths.
Worse, GM must answer hard questions about who knew what and when. Its preliminary chronology indicates that some GM employees knew as long ago as 2004 that a faulty ignition switch on some models could kill the engine in a moving car, disabling airbags, making steering difficult and leading to crashes.
For reasons not fully known, GM did not initiate a recall until Feb. 13 of this year, then expanded it Feb. 25 to about twice as many models. It now covers the 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and 2007 Saturn Sky.
And remember that GM employs thousands of North Texans at its Arlington assembly plant. Problems in Detroit radiate across America. GM officials can ask their counterparts at Toyota how safety issues can shake a company s foundation.
New CEO Mary Barra supposedly had no knowledge of the ignition-switch problem before she initiated the recall, writing to employees that she  acted without hesitation.  This week, GM brought in Anton Valukas to head its internal investigation. He s the Chicago lawyer who led the court-ordered investigation of the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.
GM will get plenty of uninvited outside help. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Michigan Republican Fred Upton, has announced it will hold hearings. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller says he will order them, too. The Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation, as it did four years ago with Toyota s unintended acceleration problems. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given GM until April 3 to answer 107 questions about how it handled the issue.
The NHTSA might also request a mirror. Joan Claybrook, the agency s former head, wants the parent U.S. Department of Transportation to investigate why the NHTSA failed to order a recall despite knowing about the ignition-switch problem as far back as 2007. Claybrook, now a safety advocate, says her former agency also  failed to carry out the law  by not forcing GM to fix the problem.
Soon, we ll run out of fingers to point.
Claybrook, as much as anyone, understands that the NHTSA s credibility is at stake with an American public wary of the cozy relationships that can develop between regulators and the regulated.
If an automaker like General Motors isn t moving fast enough to protect its customers from potentially dangerous product flaws, who speaks for those customers?
The answer, in this case, appears to have been no one. For the sake of an iconic American company and, more important, the people who buy its products, we deserve a stronger and timelier response than this.
Missed opportunities
2004: GM concedes it knew in 2004, before it launched the 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt, that the ignition switch might inadvertently move from  run  to  accessory,  stalling the engine and cutting power to safety systems.
2005: A partial fix in key design is proposed but not adopted. Dealers are told to modify existing keys with an insert and to tell owners to take extra items off their keychains if they complain of stalling problems.
2007: Federal safety officials tell GM that a 2005 fatal Cobalt crash involved a switch that malfunctioned and airbags that failed to deploy.
2009: GM adopts the key design proposed in 2005.
2013: GM determines that switches made before the 2006 modifications failed to meet design specifications.
2014: Finally, GM announces and expands its recall of vehicles with faulty ignition switches.

UPDATE 2-GM urges drivers stick to sparse key ring even after recall repair
* U.S. Senate announces its own probe of GM, NHTSA over recall
* Senate, House say criminal investigation could complicate their probes
* Faulty ignition switches linked to 12 deaths
* Hit to GM stock "overdone" -analyst
By Ben Klayman, Richard Cowan and Eric Beech
DETROIT/WASHINGTON, March 12 General Motors Co  said on Wednesday that even after the vehicles in its ignition-switch recall are repaired, owners  should avoid weighing down their key rings with anything more than the key and fob.
Also on Wednesday, U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill said a Senate subcommittee plans to hold a hearing in early April on GM's recall last month of more than 1.6 million vehicles with the faulty ignition switches which have been linked to 12 deaths. Most of the affected cars were sold in the United States.
GM became aware of the problem a decade ago.
"We have to get to the bottom of this," said McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. "We need to find out who dropped ball and put millions of Americans at risk."
GM has been telling owners affected by the recall that until the repairs are made only the key should be on the key ring. That remains largely the case after the fix as well, according to a document filed with U.S. safety regulators.
"We recommend that customers only utilize the key, key ring and key fob (if equipped) that came with the vehicle," GM said in the document filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That was in response to a question about whether customers can put their heavy key ring back on after the repair is completed.
A GM spokesman said after the repair is completed, there is no danger of the problem reoccurring. Asked why GM made this recommendation, he added that no ignition switch is safe from being moved from the "run" position if the key chains are too heavy or bulky.
Automotive research firm Edmunds.com said while there is anecdotal evidence owners should avoid too much weight on their key rings, there is no industry standard language on that subject.
The Detroit automaker also said in the filing that it will offer loaner cars in some cases and a $500 cash allowance to unhappy owners affected by the recall.
The problems in the affected vehicles in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. GM previously had said there were 13 deaths linked to the faulty ignition switch, but revised that to 12 on Tuesday because it had double-counted one incident.
The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.
GM said in the NHTSA document on Wednesday that it is providing rental or loaner vehicles in some cases.
The company also said it is not buying back affected vehicles if owners ask for that, but is offering a $500 special cash allowance, through April 30, to buy a 2013, 2014 or 2015 model-year vehicle.
On Tuesday, a source said federal prosecutors have opened a probe of GM, examining whether the company is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that led to the recall.
PARALLEL PROBES
The New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is involved in the probe, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
The federal probe by the FBI and the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. NHTSA previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.
McCaskill said the Senate Commerce Committee's consumer protection subcommittee will examine the responses of GM and NHTSA to the discovery of faulty ignition switches. She told  Reuters that the congressional probe is "more challenging" now that the Justice Department also has opened its own investigation.
"While we would like to get as much information as possible and have General Motors as witnesses," McCaskill said her panel's review is "really about how NHTSA has handled this and what are the challenges that NHTSA faces in being an effective cop on the beat."
She said she has concerns about whether NHTSA had insufficient expertise and also about a lack of transparency at the agency. She did not know which GM executives would be called to testify.
Safety advocates have criticized NHTSA for failing to catch the GM issue and failing to demand a recall despite tracking the problems at different points over the past decade.
Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said NHTSA's lack of action suggests the agency's own review process may be ineffective despite changes made after the high-profile Ford-Firestone tire recall in 2000.
However, NHTSA's chief said U.S. auto-safety regulators did not force GM to recall the cars sooner because the connection between defective ignition switches and failing airbags was not clear.
"If we had that information, if GM had provided us with timely information, we would have been able to take a different course with this," David Friedman, acting administrator for NHTSA, told Bloomberg on Wednesday in Washington.
Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters in Washington on Wednesday that he had a "high level of confidence" in NHTSA, "but we'll continue watching as facts unfold and see where we are."
Foxx said his department is having a "dialogue" with the U.S. Department of Justice about the GM recall. "They're looking at the same information we're looking at. They will make that determination."
The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also has ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about the automaker's ignition-switch problems. A House committee aide said on Wednesday that while the Justice probe may complicate what information can be received, the committee expects NHTSA and GM to comply with information requests.
GM has declined to comment on news of the criminal probe, but has said it is cooperating on all the various probes.
"We are fully cooperating with NHTSA and will do so with the Congress, too," GM spokesman Greg Martin said in an email on Wednesday. "We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts."
The automaker is also conducting an internal investigation into the matter.
GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from NHTSA, and several analysts have estimated the recall could cost the company $70 million to $280 million.
The automaker has not disclosed what the recall will cost.   Analysts agreed that the biggest costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.
Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note that Tuesday's 5 percent stock decline was "overdone" as the $3.2 billion hit to the company's market cap was likely well above any potential settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and plaintiffs' lawyers.
However, Johnson added that it was unclear what might make the stock rise in coming months as continued media headlines were likely to weigh heavily on GM shares.
GM shares fell 0.9 percent to close at $34.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

The GM Recall Scandal: Who Knew What, and When?
Congress and the Department of Justice want to know whether General Motors knew of a dangerous ignition problem years before it issued a recall.

In the wake of a scathing New York Times investigation published this past weekend, all hell is breaking loose over the General Motors recall of more than 1.6 million cars with faulty ignitions. We covered the scope of the mechanical failure earlier, a failure that can lead to your car turning off while you're driving it, and what to do if your vehicle falls under the recall. But the fallout is just beginning. The Times piece says that 260 incidents of ignition failures were reported to GM and to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). Now both that federal agency and the carmaker are coming under heavy fire.
Most Popular
Congress Is Getting Involved
Both the Senate and House of Representatives are holding committee hearings that involve not only General Motors but whether the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration failed to properly investigate both fatal and nonfatal accidents involving the ignition switch failures. NHTSA issued a statement saying that its investigations failed to find cause to issue a formal investigation. Instead, over the past decade the agency fired out multiple replies to concerned owners that went a lot like this one . NHTSA's failure to act, and especially its failure to link the frequency of ignition faults to force a wider investigation, is going to come under heavy scrutiny from Congress.
The Justice Department Is Getting Involved
DOJ is focusing on GM and whether the company purposely misled NHTSA. If there's any such evidence to support a case against the carmaker, this case could get far worse potentially as bad as the Firestone/Ford Explorer debacle in the late 1990s/early 2000s.
Who Knew What, When?
Earlier, PopMech reported that GM issued a technical service bulletin (TSB) way back in 2005 related to the ignition problem. But on March 4, no doubt under pressure from both houses of Congress and the Department of Justice, the lead legal council of NTSB fired off an exceedingly detailed, 27-page " Timeliness Query " to GM that includes the request for 107 very specific facts. Scroll down to page 18 of NHTSA's letter to General Motors and you get to the government's hunt for the smoking gun: whether GM knew of a potential solution for the ignition failure as far back as 2005 (or possibly 2004 there are conflicting reports) but nixed implementing this solution and instead opted for the far cheaper (free) technical service bulletin. Now NHTSA wants to know the names of all staff involved in both the proposed repair and anyone involved in spiking the fix.
Even More Damning: The Repair Cost Is Tiny
According to The Detroit News , auto analysts for J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets have noted that the replacement-part costs will be as little as $2 to $5 each, and labor costs will be low as well because the repair is quite simple. It would not put GM in a good light if it turns out the company was stinting on these repairs, all the while knowing that the repairs themselves would cost so little.
Liable for Deaths?
It's possible, because of GM's bankruptcy restructuring, that the company would be shielded from wrongful death claims. According to CNN Money , GM's restructuring allows the company (as well as Chrysler) to walk from all liability claims that predate 2009, when the carmaker emerged from insolvency. If a case involves a product sold before that date, then the suit goes against a shell corporation, not against GM, and the upshot has been not only to shield General Motors but also that most claimants have gotten very poor compensation.
In the face of exceedingly bad PR, however, it seems highly unlikely GM would stick to this policy. The clouds grow only darker with each passing revelation about this recall.

Families Suing GM Because Recall Comes Too Late
March 12, 2014, 03:00:00PM
. By Lucy Campbell
New York, NY
Further to a recent massive General Motors recall involving  certain model year 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, and 2007 Pontiac G5 vehicles, at least one family who lost a child as a result of the defect is suing GM.
The recall involves over 748,024 model year 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice vehicles and 2003-2007 Saturn Ion vehicles and 2007 Saturn Sky vehicles. But GM s actions are eight years too late for Doug Weigel who lost his teenage daughter as a result of a related car accident. In 2006, 18-year old Natasha Weigel and her friend, Amy Rademaker,15, were riding in a 2005 Chevy Cobalt, one of GM s recently recalled vehicles, when the car suddenly lost power and crashed into trees on a rural Wisconsin road. Amy died nearly five hours after the accident, but Natasha lay in a coma for 11 days before dying.
"I'd go to work every day, smile and then I'd get in my car to go home and start bawling," Weigel told USA Today. At the time of his daughter's death he was in the Army and months away from deployment. "I have been at terms with it for a long time. I've been OK, but now this comes."
The defect that s prompted the recall involves allegedly faulty ignition switches that can suddenly turn the engine off and disable the airbags. According to USA Today.com this defect has so far killed 13 people and caused 31 crashes. Adding insult to injury, GM has reportedly known of the defect since 2004, but failed to initiate a recall until February 2014, a full decade later.

Were GM Lawyers Involved in Ignition Switch Defect Cover Up?
With the Weigel accident, a crash-investigation team was commissioned by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), who wanted specifics. They found that at 7:55 p.m., the Cobalt veered off the road doing 71 mph, vaulted a driveway and flew 59 feet before clipping a utility box on the ground and slamming into a grove of trees at about 55 mph, USA Today reports.
Then, in 2007, the investigators reported that, according to the car's data recorder, the ignition switch was in the "accessory" position instead of "run," and the front airbags didn't deploy. It also noted that there were several complaints in NHTSA's database about ignition switch problems.
Prior to GM issuing the February recall, the automaker had maintained that the cars involved were safe because they could be steered and stopped. But for some families this remains to be proven and for anyone whose lost a loved one, like the Weigels, the recall comes too late.

Product recalls are the precautionary steps taken to avoid accidents due to any glitch in a vehicle. However, the recalls dent the company s image and the 0.8% fall in Toyota Motor Corp. s ( TM - Free Report )  shares on Mar 11 highlights that. The decline was due to the news that Toyota has recalled 7,067 of its new Highlander crossover SUVs. The recall is being made to fix a problem in the seat belts.
The recalled Highlander crossovers are from model year 2014. According to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the middle seat belt of the third row is not properly secured to the vehicle s floor. In case of a crash, a faulty seat belt will increase the probability of injury. However, no cases of casualties have been reported.
Toyota will be recalling the vehicles later this month. The Toyota dealers will service the recalled Highlanders at no extra charge. Toyota had commercialized the third-generation Highlander this year.
The new 2014 Highlander comes with a new look, a sophisticated cabin and better safety and technology. It offers a choice between a four-cylinder, a V-6 and a hybrid engine.
Toyota witnessed several recalls in Feb 2014. On Feb 12, the automaker announced the global recall of 1.9 million third-generation Prius cars to repair a software problem in the hybrid system. Following this, on Feb 14, Toyota recalled 295,000 vehicles of the Lexus and Toyota brands globally due safety system problems involving stability control and anti-lock brakes. 261,114 of the total recalled vehicles of model years 2012 and 2013 were in the U.S.
Moreover, on Feb 17, Toyota announced its intent to recall 13,000 FJ Cruiser sport-utility vehicles in the Middle East, Australia, Africa and Panama. The recall will be made to rectify fuel tubes prone to overheating, which may cause them to melt, leading to gas leaks. This defect has led to five fire reports, although there is no report of casualty. The recalled FJ Cruisers were manufactured in the Oct 2012 Jan 2014 period.
Currently, Toyota carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other automobile stocks worth considering are Daimler AG ( DDAIF - Free Report ) , Tata Motors Ltd. ( TTM - Free Report )  and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. ( HMC - Free Report ) . Daimler and Tata Motors carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Honda is a Zacks Rank #2 stock.

Grow Your Wealth Like the Best Dividend Investors (GuruFocus)
Seeing the words  Congressional investigation  paired with the name of your company is never a good thing. Such was the case for General Motors (NYSE: GM ) late Monday, when the company found itself the target of a government committee poised to investigate GM admissions it knew in 2004 about a deadly problem with the ignition switch in certain GM vehicles, but failed to issue a recall until 10 years later.
Despite 250 complaints from drivers about the faulty ignition switch, neither the carmaker nor regulatory authorities acted on those complaints until February of this year when General Motors issued a recall . The deaths of 13 drivers have been linked to the faulty ignition.
Because of this, Michigan congressional representative Fred Upton (R) announced Monday that the House Energy and Commerce Committee would launch an investigation designed to gather  detailed information  from both General Motors and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Related:  GM Financial Expanding Into Prime Loans
The investigation, which Upton said would take place in coming weeks, would seek to determine whether General Motors or federal regulators failed to follow regulations designed to protect the public.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Upton said, "Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner? If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended."
Upton is no stranger to auto safety legislation having served as lead sponsor of the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability,and Documentation (TREAD) Act in 2000. The TREAD Act came in response to a series of accidents involving Ford (NYSE: F ) sport-utility vehicles and requires automakers to quickly report fatal accidents related to safety defects
General Motors said Monday it had hired Chicago lawyer, Anton Valukas, to lead the company s internal investigation into the recall. Clearly, GM had an eye on being as proactive as possible under the circumstances .
Meanwhile, although GM released a chronology describing how the ignition switch problem was discovered that information does not reveal who was responsible for the fact the recall didn t occur until a decade after the defect was first reported.
The NHTSA has also not explained why that agency didn t initiate action after officials pointed out the problem in 2007.
GM was scheduled to file a second chronology this week detailing why it expanded the initial recall on Feb. 25, doubling the number of vehicles affected.
At the time of this writing, Jim Probasco  had no position in any mentioned securities.

The General Motors Co. recall involving a faulty ignition switch that is being blamed for 12 deaths in the United States has spread to Canada.
General Motors of Canada Ltd. began sending out letters this week to about 235,000 owners of Pontiac, Saturn and Chevrolet vehicles that are the subject of a recall in the United States as well as a Department of Justice investigation and probes by two U.S. congressional committees and U.S. safety regulators.
  The Globe and Mail
Video: The winners and losers of the Canada-South Korea free-trade agreement
The problem is that the ignition switch may move out of the  run  position, causing a partial electrical failure, turning off the engine and rendering the air bags useless if the vehicle is involved in a crash, GM Canada said in a memorandum to dealers. The risk increases if the key ring is carrying more than the car key.
Until the vehicles are repaired,  customers should be advised that it is very important that they remove all the items from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key,  the memo said in boldfaced type.
The recall, which now involves 1.6 million vehicles worldwide, threatens to derail the auto maker s recovery from bankruptcy protection in 2009 and damage the reputation it has gained since then for vastly improving the quality of its vehicles.
GM has acknowledged that it knew about the problem a decade ago and new chief executive officer Mary Barra has promised a thorough internal review so the situation will not repeated.
GM Canada joined its parent company Wednesday in offering owners of the recalled vehicles a $500 rebate toward the purchase of a new 2013, 2014 or 2015 Chevrolet, GMC, Buick or Cadillac model. Customers worried about driving their vehicles before they are fixed will be offered loaners.
The vehicles affected in Canada are: 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalts; 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice models; 2005-2006 Pontiac Pursuits; 2007 Pontiac G5 and Saturn Sky cars; and 2003-2007 Saturn Ions.
The $500 cash rebate will not be used as a marketing tool, the memo to dealers said.
 This allowance is not a sales tool; it is to be used to help customers in need of assistance. 
The company said it expects to have replacement parts for repairs to vehicles by April 7.
The recall has hurt GM s share price, but any product liability should be restricted to pre-bankruptcy GM, Barclays Bank PLC analyst Brian Johnson said in a note to clients.
GM s trip through Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection limited any liability from lawsuits and other actions that were filed before the 2009 bankruptcy filing.
It is possible, Mr. Johnson noted, that regulators could issue fines and customers could file lawsuits against  new  GM.
 The timing of when GM learned of fatalities related to the faulty ignition switches could potentially determine if GM will be held criminally liable,  he wrote. The cost of the recall could reach $100-million (U.S.), he said.
Transport Canada said Wednesday that it is still assessing questions asked about the recall.

General Motors is recalling an additional 824,000 to replace the ignition switches. That means all model years of its Chevrolet Cobalt, HHR, Pontiac G5, Solstice and Saturn Ion and Sky in the U.S. will get new switches because faulty switches may have been used to repair the vehicles.
The parts are at the center of the company s recently announced ignition switch recall , which originally extended through the 2007 model year. About 95,000 faulty switches were sold to dealers and aftermarket wholesalers. Of those, about 90,000 were used to repair older vehicles that were repaired before they were recalled in February.
Recalling everything
Because it is not feasible to track down all the parts, the company is recalling 824,000 more vehicles in the U.S. to ensure that every car has a current ignition switch. GM says it is unaware of any reports of fatalities with this group of vehicles where a frontal impact occurred, the front air bags did not deploy and the ignition is in the  accessory  or  off  position.
As with the earlier recalls, if the torque performance is not to GM specification, the ignition switch may unintentionally move from the  run  position to the  accessory  or  off  positions, leading to a loss of power. The risk may be increased if the key ring is carrying added weight or if the vehicle goes off road or experiences some jarring event.
The timing of the key movement out of the  run  position relative to when the sensing algorithm of a crash may result in the air bags not deploying, increasing the potential for occupant injury in certain kinds of crashes.
Until the recall has been performed, GM is urging customers to remove all items -- including the key fob -- from their key rings, leaving only the vehicle key.
 We are taking no chances with safety,  said GM CEO Mary Barra.  Trying to locate several thousand switches in a population of 2.2 million vehicles and distributed to thousands of retailers isn t practical. Out of an abundance of caution, we are recalling the rest of the model years.
 We are going to provide our customers with the peace of mind they deserve and expect by getting the new switches into all the vehicles,  Barra said.
Affected models
GM records indicate the service parts may have been used for ignition repairs in:
2008-2010 Chevrolet Cobalts

The U.S. Attorney's office in New York  has opened a criminal investigation into General Motors to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing on the part of GM stemming from the automaker's faulty ignition switch recall last month, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.
The Justice Department is reportedly looking to whether General Motors broke any laws in the recall stemming from an ignition switch. Charlie Ros...
The FBI has joined federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York in the probe, reports CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton. Subpoenas have already begun to go out.
General Motors announced Wednesday that it is offering free loaner cars and $500 toward a new GM vehicle to more than a million owners of the compact cars that are being recalled.
CBS News correspondent Jeff Glor reported that another death that may be linked .
When a Chevy Cobalt crashed in Georgia four years ago this week, the engine was not running. The ignition switch was in the accessory position. A 29-year-old nurse named Brooke Melton, who was wearing her seat belt, died.
"When I saw my daughter in the emergency room and I kissed her cold forehead, I said, I will vindicate this. I will vindicate your death. And I will try to save as many lives as I can," said her father, Ken Melton.
Five years before Brooke Melton died, General Motors issued a service bulletin to its dealers about faulty ignition switches.
When Brooke Melton took her car to a GM dealership, the service report, which CBS News obtained, said "Customer states engine shut off while driving, please check."
Technicians cleaned the fuel injection.
Melton got the car back on March 9. She was killed March 10.
GM settled with the family last year.
Lance Cooper, who represents the Meltons, says he believes the recall would not have happened if the family had not sued.
GM now says ignition switches can turn to off or accessory when they're bumped, or if a driver has a heavy key ring. When that happens, a car has no power steering, no power brakes, and the seat belts and airbags don't work.
Cooper discovered that GM changed the switch design in 2006 but never notified customers or dealers. When the settlement offer came, he was about to depose Jim Federico, the man who ran GM's investigation into the issue in 2012 and 2013. Federico is now the company's executive director of engineering.

DETROIT (AP)   General Motors faced more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars yesterday as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened probes into the matter.
The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter. The inquiry is being handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.
Spokesmen for the Justice Department and GM would not comment. The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg News.
At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government's road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn't take action sooner.

The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government's road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn't take action sooner.
GM announced last month it will replace ignition switches that can shut off car motors unexpectedly. When that happens, drivers lose power-assisted steering and brakes and can lose control of the cars. The ignition can slip from the run position to accessory or off, due partly to heavy key chains dangling from the steering column.
Also, if the ignition switch isn't in the run position, air bags may not inflate if a crash occurs.
An Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found that drivers started submitting complaints about the problem in early 2005, shortly after the first Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale. The review of complaints about the Cobalt, GM's top-selling small car in the mid-2000s, found 173 instances of engine stalling or air bags failing to deploy, both symptoms of the ignition problem. Many drivers reported problems with keys sticking in the ignition in addition to the stalling.
Fred Upton of Western Michigan, the chairman of the House committee, said in a statement Monday that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks.
Congress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to NHTSA. The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.

GM Offers $500 Off Next Purchase for Owners of Ignition Recall Cars
By Kelsey Mays
March 11, 2014
Share  
Following the recall of 1.37 million Chevrolet, Pontiac and Saturn compact cars and roadsters over a faulty ignition switch, GM announced it will offer $500 off the purchase or lease of any new car to affected owners. But it's not advertising the rebate or telling dealers to promote it. The program runs through April 30.
More on the GM Ignition Recall
The February 2014 recall affects all model years of the Saturn Ion, plus the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 compacts. The 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR hatchback and 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky roadsters have also been affected by the recall. The recall involves a faulty ignition switch that may slip into the Accessory or Off position and disarm the airbags.
The Detroit News reports GM repurchased at least 13 Chevrolet Cobalts in 2005 and 2006 after consumers reported problems. The automaker will not repurchase any vehicles now, but owners will receive $500 off the purchase or lease of any new 2013, 2014 or 2015 Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet or GMC vehicle, which would be in addition to the affected car's trade-in value.
The ignition issue has been linked to 31 crashes and 12 fatalities when airbags did not deploy, but court documents from 2013 show that GM knew about the issue as early as 2004. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a congressional committee have opened investigations, and federal investigators today launched a criminal probe .
"Everything would be done individually," GM spokesman Alan Adler told us of the $500 deal. "The dealers are not pushing this on them, and they've been told not to do that."
Adler then sent us an official statement from GM: "In keeping with our commitment to help customers involved in this recall, a special $500 cash allowance is available to purchase or lease a new GM vehicle. We have been very clear in our message to dealers that this allowance is not a sales tool and it is only to be used to help customers in need of assistance. Neither GM nor its dealers will market or solicit owners using this allowance."
GM expects replacement parts to be available this April, according to the Detroit News. In the meantime, the automaker will furnish loaner or rental cars to affected owners and tow any affected cars to dealerships if owners feel they're unsafe to drive.

General Motors replacement part costs released
Wednesday, March 12, 2014 2:15 p.m. EDT
DETROIT (WKZO) -- A new report finds the cost of a replacement part for faulty ignition switches in 1.6-million General Motors vehicles may be as little as two-dollars per part. Auto analysts at JP Morgan released their findings related to the recall this week. GM supplier Delphi Corporation may incur some of the costs for the new part. Officials say 13 deaths and 31 accidents were caused by the failure of the ignition switch.

Summary
GM faces a similar situation to the one Toyota faced in 2010.
While the Toyota 2010 recall was different than the GM 2014, Toyota provides framework for GM traders and investors to learn from.
Long-term investors should use weakness to buy GM while traders should look to buy Ford.
Shares of General Motors (NYSE: GM ) have come under significant selling pressure after the company recent announced a 1.6 million vehicle recall. GM shares have fallen even further after Congress announced its own investigation into the problem. Traders and investors should consider how Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM ) shares responded to a similar situation in 2010.
Toyota 2010 Recall Timeline
January 16, 2010: Toyota informs NHTSA that accelerator pedals made by supplier CTS corp may have dangerous sticking effect.
January 21, 2010: Toyota announces recall for 2.3 million Toyota vehicles.
January 25, 2010: NHTSA informs Toyota it is legally obliged vehicles.
January 26, 2010: Toyota halts sales of eight best selling models including Camry and Corolla.
January 27, 2010: Toyota recalls an additional 1.1 million vehicles.
February 2, 2010: Toyota reports 16% drop in monthly sales.
The charts below show how Toyota, and rival Ford, shares traded during the recall and following the recall. The initial response to the recall was quite negative with Toyota shares falling sharply and remaining sharply lower for most of 2010. Comparably, Ford shares received a clear boost from problems and falling sales at Toyota.
TM data by YCharts
While it did take Toyota a considerable amount of time to recover from its woes, the company did ultimately recover and its stock price has eclipsed pre recall levels.

Applying The Toyota Framework To GM
While the issues facing GM do not appear to be quite as difficult as the ones Toyota faced in 2010, the Toyota 2010 episode is a useful framework to use when evaluating GM shares right now.
Long-Term Investors Should Buy GM
Long-term investors should use current weakness as a buying opportunity. While it may take a significant amount of time to resolve current issues, the long-term outlook for GM remains bright. That said, it remains likely that negative headlines will continue to flow for the foreseeable future. Long-term investors should consider making measured buys in GM shares and averaging in to a long position over time. No matter how ugly the headlines get and how far sales fall, I believe GM will recover overtime.
Short Term Traders Should Buy Ford
Perhaps the best way to trade the GM story over the short-term is to buy competitors such as Ford (NYSE: F ). Ford shares have yet to rally much on the GM news but that could change. If the headlines continue to flow and GM takes a reputational hit, I expect Ford to pick up at least some market share over the short-term. Ford shares should move higher on any sales gains.
What Not To Do
At this point, I believe the riskiest thing to do would be to sell GM shares short. While the saga does not appear to be nearing a close, the situation could change at any time. A significant amount of negative news has already been factored into GM shares and the stock could move sharply higher on any positive news.

The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into whether an ignition defect linked to 13 fatalities was ignored by General Motors for over a decade before it launched a massive recall last month.
On Tuesday, a congressional panel launched its own investigation. Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D) of West Virginia has asked for a Senate investigation, as well.
The probe follows a North American recall of GM vehicles with faulty ignition switches including the Chevrolet Cobalt, Pontiac G5 , and Pontiac Pursuit in model years 2005-07 (sold only in Canada); the 2003-07 Saturn Ion; the 2006-07 Chevrolet HHR and Pontiac Solstice; and the 2007 Saturn Sky. 
GM says the ignition defect could cause the engine and electrical systems of an affected vehicle to be switched off while the vehicle is in operation. A faulty ignition switch might be knocked out of the  run  position if the vehicle goes off-road or is jarred in some way, said GM, and could mean airbags won t deploy in a crash. 
Recommended: Top 5 product recalls in US history
GM has linked the defect to 31 accidents and 13 fatalities.  The company also told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it investigated reports of problems with the ignition switches over the past 10 years but never fixed or replace the parts. It didn't launch the recall of the 1.6 million affected vehicles until last month, and it's that inaction that has sparked the investigations.

Even after recall repair, GM recommends only key, fob on key ring
FULL COVERAGE:
INDIA ELECTIONS 2017
DETROIT, March 12 General Motors Co said on Wednesday that even after the vehicles in its ignition-switch recall are repaired, owners should still have only the key and fob on the key ring.
GM has been telling the owners of the more than 1.6 million vehicles with the faulty ignition switches linked to 12 deaths that until the repairs are made only the key should be on the key ring. That remains largely the case after the fix as well, according to a document filed with U.S. safety regulators.
"We recommend that customers only utilize the key, key ring and key fob (if equipped) that came with the vehicle," GM said in the document filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That was in response to a question about whether customers can put their heavy key ring back on after the repair is completed.
A GM spokesman said after the repair is completed, there is no danger of the problem reoccurring.
Automotive research firm Edmunds.com said while there is anecdotal evidence owners should avoid too much weight on their key rings, there is no industry standard language on that subject.
GM disclosed how it is answering customer questions related to last month's recall in a "frequently asked questions" document filed with NHTSA.
The Detroit automaker also said in the filing that it will offer loaner cars in some cases and a $500 cash allowance to unhappy owners affected by the recall.
The problems in the affected vehicles in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. GM previously had said there were 13 deaths linked to the faulty ignition switch, but revised that to 12 on Tuesday because it had double-counted one incident.
The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.
GM said in the NHTSA document on Wednesday that it is providing rental or loaner vehicles in some cases.
The company also said it is not buying back affected vehicles if owners ask for that, but is offering a $500 special cash allowance, through April 30, to buy a 2013, 2014 or 2015 model-year vehicle.
"This special cash allowance must be passed on to the eligible customer at the time of the transaction and is in addition to other national and regional offers," GM said in the filing. "The special cash allowance is not transferable and is intended to assist those customers who are unhappy and may want to trade out of their vehicle or buy a new GM product.
"GM will not market or solicit owners using this allowance," the company added. "We ask that dealers do not market to or solicit these customers either. This special cash allowance is not a sales tool; it is to be used to help customers in need of assistance."
On Tuesday, a source said federal prosecutors have opened a probe of GM, examining whether the company is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that led to the recall.
The federal probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. NHTSA previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.
Also on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM's ignition-switch problems.
GM declined to comment on news of the criminal probe, but has said it is cooperating with regulators and Congress in their probes.
The automaker is also conducting an internal investigation into the matter.
GM faces a fine of up to $35 million from NHTSA, and several analysts have estimated the recall could cost the company $70 million to $280 million.
The automaker has not disclosed what the recall will cost.   Analysts agreed that the biggest costs could come from lawsuits likely to result from the recall and probe.

Better Data Would Have Started GM Recall Sooner: NHTSA
Laura Litvan and Jeff Plungis
U.S. auto-safety regulators didn t force General Motors Co. to recall 1.6 million cars sooner because the connection between defective ignition switches and failing air bags wasn t clear, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.
 If we had that information, if GM had provided us with timely information, we would have been able to take a different course with this,  David Friedman, acting administrator for NHTSA, said in an interview today in Washington.
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, is facing a federal criminal probe and inquiries from NHTSA and both chambers of Congress as to why it didn t act sooner to recall the Chevrolet Cobalt and five other cars over the switch defect now linked to 12 crash deaths. A timeline GM gave regulators last month shows it began investigating complaints about the switch in 2004.
NHTSA has come under criticism by auto-safety advocates for not following up more aggressively when it raised the ignition-switch issue with GM executives at a meeting in 2007. The agency never started a defect investigation, a step that can lead to a recall.
 We took several efforts to look into this data,  Friedman said.  At the end of the day, with the data we had at that time, we didn t think that was sufficient to open up a formal investigation. 
Friedman said NHTSA did three crash investigations, two of which were previously disclosed, to better understand what was happening in instances in which Cobalt air bags didn t deploy.
2006 Probe
 We are fully cooperating with NHTSA, and we welcome the opportunity to help the agency have a full understanding of the facts,  a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, said.
NHTSA looked into complaints that came into the agency to try to understand how much the Cobalt stood out with peers in respect to air-bag failures, Friedman said. The agency received 260 complaints related to the switches, according to the New York Times.
GM recalled the vehicles when it got new information making a direct connection between the ignition-switch failures, which had been known for almost a decade, and air bags not going off, Friedman said.
NHTSA sent investigators to document a high-speed Cobalt crash in Wisconsin in 2006 that killed two women in which the engine cut off and air bags didn t deploy. The team identified a failure similar to one cited by GM in the recall.
Outside investigators hired by NHTSA at that time found six similar complaints in agency databases and a GM technical-service bulletin to dealers acknowledging a faulty switch design and offering free repairs to customers who complained.
Former NHTSA Administrator Joan Claybrook asked the Transportation Department s inspector general to investigate whether the agency failed to meet its legal obligations.
The agency  obviously failed to carry out its responsibilities in this case,  Claybrook wrote in a March 7 letter.  No one is evaluating why NHTSA failed to carry out the law.

GM offers $500 new-car discount to owners affected by recall
Updated March 12, 2014, 1:17 pm
     
  by Justin King
Automaker tells dealers not to use the allowance as a "sales tool."
General Motors has offered $500 towards the purchase of a new car for current owners who have been affected by the controversial ignition-switch recall.
The company cautions that it is not offering vehicle repurchases in response to the recall, however The Detroit News suggests the company already repurchased at least 13 Chevrolet Cobalts due to reports of the problem in 2005 in 2006. With more than 1.5 million vehicles involved in the recall, a broader buyback program would be unprecedented.
"To assist dealers in helping customers who are involved in this recall that request assistance, we are announcing a special cash allowance in the amount $500 available when these customers purchase or lease a new 2013/ 2014 / 2015 model year Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac," the company wrote in a notice to dealers.
The discount program may mark one of the first moves to help mitigate a looming public-relations disaster, as the company faces separate investigations from the US House, Senate, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Justice Department.
At least 12 deaths have been officially associated on the issue, which can spontaneously shut off the engine and disable the airbags, though separate reports claim more than 50 people may have been killed in accidents caused by the defect.
The investigations primarily focus on why GM knew about the problems as early as 2004 but waited an entire decade before issuing a recall.

Pressure on GM from Washington, D.C., escalated Tuesday, as a Congressional investigation gave the automaker two weeks to respond to a documentation request regarding incidents leading up to the recall of 1.6 million vehicles as well as a timeline of reports to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which oversees vehicle recalls.
The legislators have a total of 107 questions about the recall , which covered six models, sold from the 2003 through 2007 model years. At root is an ignition switch that can move out of its normal  on  position while driving leading to the loss of power (and steering and braking assist, in some cases) along with a risk that airbags won t deploy in a resulting accident.
In all, the issue has been attributed in at least 31 crashes and 13 deaths, in the following models that were recalled last month:
The procedure of such a Congressional investigation was laid out by the Tread Act of 2000, which was a piece of auto-safety legislation prompted by the high-profile recall that year, of Ford Explorer SUVs equipped with Firestone tires.  The committee will examine whether GM knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain on the road,  said U.S. Representative Henry Waxman , the top-ranking Democrat of the committee.
NHTSA has already opened a separate investigation into the matter checking that GM reported the issue in what would be considered a timely manner and GM has provided such a chronology.
GM was allegedly first aware of the issue in 2004, when it concerned a 2005 Chevy Cobalt; and according to the Wall Street Journal a GM engineer proposed a new design that could handle additional weight from a key ring (part of the issue); although the revised design was later canceled.
However as lawyers set GM in their sights, one legal issue could get in the way: Under the restructuring that occurred when the  old GM  became the  new GM,  the automaker s product liability only extends back to July 2009; claims on issues prior to that would need to be addressed through bankruptcy court .
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors are considering a criminal probe regarding the matter. And a Senate inquiry? While one hasn t yet been initiated, that could happen in coming days.

Justice looking into decades-long action on safety flaws
Published: 03/12/2014 at 12:21 PM
(NEW YORK TIMES) The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into General Motors  decade-long failure to address deadly safety problems before announcing a huge vehicle recall last month, according to people briefed on the matter.
The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is focused on whether G.M., the nation s largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects. The prosecutors, one of the people said, are questioning whether G.M. misled federal regulators about the extent of the problems.
The investigation is the latest in a widening series of threats to G.M. over its handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.

General Motors starts damage control over recall
Mar. 12, 2014 12:07 PM ET
|About: General Motors Company (GM) |By: Clark Schultz , SA News Editor
General Motors ( GM -1%) will offer the 1.6M owners of the cars recalled due to an ignition switch issue a $500 cash allowance if they want to trade into a new vehicle.
The cash allowance offer expires on April 30.
All indications are that the automaker will be dealing with the backlash over its delayed disclosure of the issue for quite a while.

General Motors ( GM ) is now offering $500 cash back to people who bought its recalled cars -- to use if they want to buy or lease a new vehicle -- as the automaker faces multiple government probes into why it failed to notify consumers in a timely fashion of ignition problems in a number of popular vehicles that are alleged to have caused the deaths of at least 13 people and dozens of crashes.
Continue Reading Below
GM says the  allowance  is for customers who want to trade in their car or buy a new one; the new offer is effectively only through April 30, however. The besieged carmaker disclosed the cash back deal in a filing with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  
A federal prosecutor in New York has launched a criminal investigation into General Motors'  handling of the car flaw that resulted in the fatalities. 
General Motors is said to have known a decade ago about problems with the ignition switches  of the popular models, including the Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac's G5 and Solstice, and Saturn's Sky and Ion. 
The crisis is the first test of GM s new CEO Mary Barra, who ran the carmaker s product development division. GM says it is cooperating with authorities.

General Motors may be facing a criminal investigation over its delay in recalling vehicles with faulty ignition switches blamed for 13 deaths and 31 accidents, The New York Times and Reuters are reporting.
Both news organizations are quoting a person familiar with the investigation.
As NPR's Sonari Glinton reported, GM is already facing a congressional inquiry into its actions. Allan Kam, a retired senior attorney for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told Sonari that the issue here is that GM knew that its cars had ignition issues for 10 years, yet it only recalled 1.6 million vehicles last month.
The New York Times reports that the NHTSA is also investigating and the company has also launched its own internal review. The Times adds:
"It is rare, but not unprecedented for the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against an auto company for how it handles recalls.
"The department, for example, is currently in discussions with Toyota about settling a four-year criminal probe into how the Japanese automaker disclosed complaints related to unintended acceleration of its vehicles.
"The G.M. probe, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company's admission to N.H.T.S.A. on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches at various times over the past ten years, but never moved to fix or replace the parts."

Federal prosecutors open criminal probe of GM recall
Federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first came to light 10 years ago
World Bulletin/News Desk
Federal prosecutors are examining whether General Motors is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths and led to a recall last month, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
The New York-based probe is in its early stages, and the source did not elaborate on the legal theory behind the potential criminal liability.
Federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first came to light 10 years ago, according to the source.
The source did not want to be named because the probe has not been disclosed publicly.
GM declined to comment on Tuesday. Shares of GM closed down 5 percent to $35.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The federal probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.
Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM 's ignition switch problems.
The problems in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected.
The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.
GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.
The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive Plc , said in a statement on Tuesday that the part had not been provided to any other automaker.
One analyst said the recall could have a longer-term impact on GM . "The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share," RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said.
"Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM ," he said. 
TWO WEEKS TO RESPOND
GM is conducting an internal investigation into the matter and announced earlier this week that the probe would be led by Anton "Tony" Valukas , the chairman of law firm Jenner & Block.
The criminal probe of GM opened by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara follows an investigation conducted by the same office into Toyota's disclosure in 2009 of driver complaints of unintended acceleration by some of its vehicles.
Toyota has been engaged in negotiations with Bharara's office to settle that probe, which is also criminal, a source familiar with the investigation previously told Reuters.
The House committee examining the GM issue, led by Michigan Republican Fred Upton , gave the company and NHTSA until March 25 to turn over information about their responses to consumers' complaints about the problem.
The committee has asked GM officials to provide a briefing no later than March 18 on how GM has responded to reports of incidents since 2003 and its interaction with NHTSA since then on problems related to the ignition defect.
Upton led the 2000 investigation into Firestone tire failures on Ford Motor Co vehicles, resulting in the TREAD Act that requires automakers to report complaints of defects to the NHTSA.
That law also makes it a crime to intentionally mislead the agency about defects that lead to serious accidents.
The Justice Department can only open a grand jury investigation into such allegations at the request of the U.S. Transportation Secretary, according to the law.
"We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM 's recall," a Transportation Department spokesman said in a statement.
The person familiar with the criminal probe declined to discuss whether prosecutors were considering liability under the TREAD Act.

Federal prosecutors reportedly open criminal probe of GM recall
By Reuters Media on Mar 12, 2014  at 7:15 a.m.
By Emily Flitter and Aruna Viswanatha and Ben Klayman
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are examining whether General Motors is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths and led to a recall last month, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
The New York-based probe is in its early stages, and the source did not elaborate on the legal theory behind the potential criminal liability.
Federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first came to light 10 years ago, according to the source.
The source did not want to be named because the probe has not been disclosed publicly.
GM declined to comment on Tuesday. Shares of GM closed down 5 percent to $35.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The federal probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.
Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM's ignition switch problems.
The problems in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected.
The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.
GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.
The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive Plc, said in a statement on Tuesday that the part had not been provided to any other automaker.
One analyst said the recall could have a longer-term impact on GM. "The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share," RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said.
"Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM," he said.
TWO WEEKS TO RESPOND

GM Faces Criminal Probe Over Ignition-Switch Recall
By Kelsey Mays
March 12, 2014
Share  
GM's ignition-switch recall has landed the largest U.S. automaker in the sight of federal investigators. USA Today reports the U.S. attorney's office in New York has launched a criminal probe into the recall, which is now responsible for 31 crashes and 12 deaths because of airbags that fail to deploy when the ignition switch is jarred into the Off or Accessory positions leading up to a crash. GM has recalled 1.37 million cars in the U.S.   a slew of mid-2000s compact cars, which you can click below to see   but court documents from 2013 showed the automaker knew about the issue as early as 2004.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and a congressional committee have already opened separate probes. Our friends at USA Today have the whole story, which you can read here .

General Motors shares took a big hit Tuesday as a federal probe was launched into the automaker's handling of defects complaints tied to 12 deaths.
General Motors stock fell 5%, or $1.91 per share to close at $35.18 in trading Tuesday on reports of the news, and continued to fall Wednesday morning.
The kingpin automaker is under intense scrutiny for its response to complaints about faulty ignition switches, which led last month to a recall of 1.6 million cars. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York is leading the probe, reports the Wall Street Journal, but lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives are also investigating. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) said Monday the House Energy and Commerce Committee will examine whether GM knowingly allowed faulty and dangerous cars to remain in use without recalling them.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recorded a July 2005 death when safety bags did not deploy in a Chevrolet Cobalt, and pointed out the problem to GM in March 2007. The automaker did not recall the vehicles until this year.
The recall of 1.6 million autos covers the 2003-'07 Saturn Ion, the 2006-'07 Chevrolet HHR, the 2006-'07 Pontiac Solstice, the 2007 Saturn Sky, and the 2005-'07 Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5.

General Motors: The Recall and the Damage Done
By Ben Levisohn
Discounts . Competition . Lousy earnings . They ve all caused big problems for General Motors ( GM ). But none might have the potential to linger as the automaker s recall , now reported to be subject of an investigation by the Justice Department .
Agence France-Presse/Getty Images
JPMorgan s Ryan Brinkman and team note that General Motors  financial exposure seems limited:
Based upon the information currently available, we see the following key takeaways: (1) the financial cost of the recall itself seems de minimus; (2) GM s earlier bankruptcy protection shields it from liabilities resulting from accidents occurring prior to July 10, 2009   a significant majority of the cases in question; (3) GM could be liable to pay a $35 mn fine if it is found to have delayed in reporting a safety-related defect to NHTSA, which, while likely costlier than the recall itself, we still consider immaterial in the context of GM s financials; (4) the financial cost to end a possible Justice Department criminal probe does have the potential to be material, although not enough is known at this stage to assign a likelihood to this outcome; and (5) reputational risk with the potential to impact market share is, in our view, the biggest factor to currently consider; however, we expect any market share fallout to be more minor and temporary in nature than, for example, in the case of Toyota  ( TM ) in 2009-2010 or Ford ( F ) in 2000-2001   for the simple reason that there is not alleged to be any safety-related defects in GM vehicles currently on sale, with all of the affected nameplates (and even some of the affected brands) having long since been retired.
Sterne Agee s Michael Ward says General Motors should take steps to reduce that reputational risk:
Thus far, GM s actions have been voluntary and we believe the company will remain proactive in addressing the problem and will continue to comply with all government requests. In our view, the headline risk will remain until the company takes action but we believe GM is in a position to step it up by making an offer to affected customers and improve consumer perception (such as offering coupons toward the purchase of a new vehicle).
Shares of General Motors have dipped 0.2% to $35.10, while Ford Motor has dropped 0.4% to $15.24 and Toyota Motor, which announced that it s giving its Japanese workers a raise , has fallen 1.4% to $110.87.

Delay in GM recall triggers investigation

The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into General Motors  decade-long failure to address deadly safety problems before announcing a huge vehicle recall last month, according to people briefed on the matter.
The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is focused on whether GM, the nation s largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects. The prosecutors, one of the people said, are questioning if GM misled federal regulators about the extent of the problems.
The investigation is the latest in a widening series of threats to GM over its handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.
On Tuesday, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he would ask Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to hold hearings on a panel that oversees consumer product safety. The hearings are expected to begin within weeks.
A House committee said on Monday that it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM s recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide, and it sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
That agency is also investigating GM s actions since the company learned of possible defects in its ignition systems in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll of fatal accidents.
It is unclear whether any of the inquiries will lead to charges against GM. If the prosecutors in New York are unable to prove criminal liability, they could pursue civil charges.
The federal inquiry is the Justice Department s latest move to investigate how automakers have responded to recalls.
The GM investigation, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company s admission to the safety agency on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches over the last 10 years but never moved to fix or replace the parts.
When asked on Tuesday about the inquiry, a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Bloom-berg News first reported the probe.
 It s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,  said Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, a private watchdog group.

How GM plans to ride out a disturbing safety problem The Exchange Wednesday, March 12, 2014
The first indication of a problem with the ignition switch on the Chevrolet Cobalt came in 2004, right around the time General Motors ( GM ) was launching the vehicle for the first time. It took nearly a decade for GM to issue a recall to fix it. In the meantime, at least 13 people died in 31 crashes that may have been related to the faulty switches. GM and federal safety regulators have known about many of those crashes for years.
Why it took so long to act on an urgent safety matter is now a key question GM must answer. On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Justice Dept. investigators are considering pressing criminal charges against the automaker. Meanwhile, Congress is planing public hearings and personal-injury lawyers are circling. GM began the recall in early February, then expanded it a couple of weeks later. The recall tally now includes about 1.4 million Chevy Cobalts and Pontiac G5s, plus a few lower-volume models. (Full details are here .) As the controversy has grown, GM's stock has gone the other direction, falling by about 4% so far in March and 15% for the year.
The basic problem is that a key in the ignition could inadvertently slip or get bumped into the accessory or off position   even while the car is moving   which can disable power brakes, steering and airbags. GM is advising owners of the vehicles to use the key alone, without a key chain or anything else that could add weight to the ignition switch, until replacement parts are shipped to dealers and owners are notified a fix is ready.
The potential death toll makes the GM recall the most significant since Toyota recalled more than 6 million vehicles in 2009 and 2010, in a safety controversy linked to more than 80 deaths. That fiasco could ultimately cost Toyota more than $2 billion in fines, lost sales and litigation. But GM seems to have learned from Toyota s troubles, and may not face nearly the damage to its sales or brand image that Toyota did. Here are 4 reasons why:
The problem happened at the  old GM.  All recalled models were manufactured before GM declared bankruptcy and received a federal bailout in 2009. GM no longer makes any of the vehicles. And since the recalled vehicles were built, GM has undergone a vast transformation under four CEOs, including the current chief, Mary Barra.  I don t think this is going to get as big as the Toyota issue,  says Karl Brauer of car-research site KBB.com .  These are old models that GM never hung its hat on. It was a long time ago. 
So far, consumers seem to agree. GM s  buzz score,  as measured by research firm YouGov Brand Index, has ticked down a little bit recently, but so have the scores for Ford ( F ) and Chrysler, as this chart shows:
That buzz could weaken further, however, since a drumbeat of negative news is like as Congress holds hearings, victims' stories make the news and a criminal probe deepens. Congressional investigators will also probe why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which enforces safety rules, never forced a recall even though it was aware of the problem.
GM is conducting the recall voluntarily. Toyota erred grievously in 2009 by aggressively resisting a recall and dismissing the complaints of customers, insisting there was nothing wrong with its vehicles until basically forced by Washington to conduct a massive recall. GM, by contrast, is admitting there s a problem and seemingly cooperating with investigators. What s still unclear, however, is whether GM stiff-armed the NHTSA and managed to prevent a recall in the years leading up to its bankruptcy, when the company was bleeding money.
There are suggestions to that effect in a timeline GM provided to the NHTSA. After investigating an early report of an ignition-switch failure, GM engineers replicated the problem during tests and proposed several solutions.  After consideration of the lead time required, cost, and effectiveness of each of these solutions, the [matter] was closed with no action,  GM reported to the government. GM was under severe cost pressure at the time, as a $2.8 billion profit in 2004 swung to a startling $10.6 billion loss in 2005.
GM didn t manufacture the part in question . A supplier, Delphi, did. That doesn't let GM off the hook, especially given that GM knew the ignition switches didn t meet its own standards shortly after they hit the market. But it might help deflect a bit of the blame and legal liability.
GM has been contrite. Barra, the CEO, has yet to make a public statement about the recall, and her personal credibility on the issue will aid or harm GM s own image. But other officials have signaled humility.  We are deeply sorry and we are working to address this issue as quickly as we can,  Alan Batey, president of GM North America, said in a statement.  The process employed to examine this phenomenon was not as robust as it should have been.  Toyota's defiance in 2009, by contrast, backfired, ultimately prompting CEO Akio Toyoda to make a public apology while saying the company he led was  grasping for salvation. 
Automotive recalls happen all the time, usually with little notice by consumers, except for those faced with the inconvenience of bringing their car in for a fix at the automakers  expense. But the combination of harmed drivers and corporate arrogance   whether real or perceived   can quickly turn an obscure technical matter into a corporate disaster, especially if criminal probes and other types of litigation drag on. Toyota, for instance, still hasn't settled all the legal matters relating to its 2009 and 2010 recalls, and data from research site Edmunds.com shows that Toyota's market share and popularity with buyers suffered for at least two years following the controversy.
GM, meanwhile, is finally healthy again after years of struggle and a bankruptcy that could have ended in liquidation if not for the taxpayer bailout. "They re as galvanized as they could be,  says Brauer.  Overall, the company is as strong as it s been since the 1970s.  That might make it a good time for GM to bear the cost of an unwelcome recall. As long as it didn t delay the cost, at its customers  expense, during leaner times.

SwitchGate: Feds Open Criminal Probe of GM s Ignition Switch Recall

General Motors  massive recall action involving more than 1.6 million vehicles has attracted the attention of federal prosecutors, who are examining whether the carmaker is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths.

NHTSA Now Under Scrutiny With GM Over Ignition Switch Defect
Posted by Greg Webb
Tweet
The GM-National Traffic Highway Safety Administration debacle continues with much finger pointing and rhetoric. The story of General Motor s failure to issue a timely recall started when they issued the first notice of a recall on February 13.     They expanded the recall on February 25, adding more models and raising the number from 778,00 to over 1.6 million vehicles.  By the end of February questions began to arise about why GM has taken so long to fix a problem that began causing crashes and deaths as far back as 2004.
Now the scrutiny is being extended to the NHTSA. Why did they wait so long? The New York Times did a thorough investigation of the accidents, consumer complaints to both GM and the NHTSA, and the ongoing communications between the two. I think this comment from Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, states the dilemma,   While GM bears complete responsibility for failing to recall these vehicles by 2005, when it knew what the defect was and how to fix it, NHTSA has responsibility for failing to order a recall by early 2007, when it knew what the effect was and how to fix it.   Ditlow is calling for a probe of the government agency, which is tasked with consumer highway safety. 
Joan Claybrook, who led the safety agency during the Carter administration, seems to agree with him,  The ability to spot trends is a huge issue, and N.H.T.S.A. has not got it under control by any means. 
General Motors announced on March 10, 2014, that it is launching an internal investigation to be led by a former federal prosecutor, Anton R. Valukas, who was the court-appointed examiner of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. And the Energy and Commerce subcommittee is launching its own investigation, under the leadership of Fred Upton, a Republican from Michigan, who led the 2000 investigation of the Ford Explorer rollover issue.  When questioned, Mr. Upton indicated that he is interested in knowing how both GM and the NHTSA failed to see a trend in the reports of the faulty ignition.   Here we are over a decade later, faced with accidents and tragedies , and significant questions need to be answered,  he said.  Did the company or regulators miss something that could have flagged these problems sooner?
To date, there are no official plans to investigate the NHTSA. However they do appear to be stepping up the intensity of their investigation. GM has until April 3 to answer 107 questions posed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about  how it mishandled the switch problems and what individual employees were responsible for not taking action on what G.M. now admits was a deadly safety defect.   
As early as 2006, GM disclosed the problem to dealers, quietly issuing a service bulletin, which resulted in repairs to 474 cars. Yet, NHTSA told Congressman Barney Frank, in a 2010 letter that it had reviewed its database of complaints to determine if a  safety defect trend  existed.  At this time, there is insufficient evidence to warrant opening a safety defect investigation,  the letter concluded.     (NYT, 3/11/14)
In its investigation the New York Times concludes that there have been reports of at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries, involving the now-recalled cars, since 2003.  Though the records mention potentially defective components, how many of these records were related to the ignition problem is unclear. Even with that additional information, regulators appear to have overlooked disturbing complaints of engine shutdowns.   (NYT, 3/11/14)
The NHTSA is in defensive mode, citing the small number of complaints relative to overall consumer concerns. They say that data alone did not show a safety defect trend; there must be a combination of consumer complaints, crash investigations and other evidence in order to warrant an investigation.
The NHTSA s justification for its failure to act has to be painful for the surviving family members of those who died as a result of the GM ignition switch defect. The story is far from over but at least consumers finally have the knowledge to take action and attempt to protect themselves a job the NHTSA has failed to do to date.

Why hang safety entirely on an ignition switch?
GM and other car companies should delay the time between the ignition switch shut off and the cutoff of power to the steering, the brakes, the airbags and the entire electronic monitoring system.
Moreover, if the car is moving, power cutoff time should be delayed further to give the driver a chance to safely pull off the road   or turn the ignition back on.
Electric powered systems are safe and the way of the future.
And they don t need to be shut off as soon as the ignition goes off.
What s the hurry, anyway?

GM criminal probe of recalls seen complicating Barra turnaround

Washington/ Michigan: The criminal investigation that opened on Tuesday into General Motors Co.  s handling of an ignition flaw linked to 13 deaths adds to legal challenges that threaten to overshadow the company s turnaround.
GM, the largest US automaker, is now at the beginning of a potentially years-long road dotted with inquiries, lawsuits, government fines and public skepticism. Besides the US justice department probe, GM must answer to Congress, the transportation department and lawyers the company hired to investigate itself.
Toyota Motor Corp. is still being examined over recalls in 2009-10 related to reports of unintended acceleration in some cars. GM similarly faces repercussions for waiting to recall 1.6 million vehicles last month, even though records show it was aware as far back as 2004 of ignition switches that could slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. The crisis arrives weeks after Mary Barra took over as chief executive officer amid rising investor and consumer optimism as GM shook off the last vestiges of its 2009 bankruptcy.
Barra is getting her feet thrown right into the fire, Dave Sullivan, an industry analyst with Southfield, Michigan- based AutoPacific Inc., said in an interview.  There s no way she is going to come out of this looking like some kind of hero. The best thing is to be honest and upfront and hopefully put this to bed as quickly as possible. 
A spokesman for Detroit-based GM, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Martin said March 10 the company was cooperating with regulators and lawmakers and that it welcomed the opportunity to help parties have a full understanding of the facts.
Consumer lawsuits
GM tumbled 5.1%  to $35.18 on Tuesday, its worst one- day share drop at the close since March 2012.
 While the immediate financial impact of GM s recall of Chevrolet Cobalts, Pontiac G5s and other vehicles is insignificant, some hard-to-quantify reputational risk is emerging, Joseph Spak, an RBC Capital Markets LLC analyst,  said in a note to investors on Tuesday.
 Remember while this was old (pre-bankruptcy) GM, the consumer won t differentiate,  Spak said.  It does appear that GM employees have known about the risk for a while, so it does seem there is a failure to act somewhere along the way. 
New legal activity is already bubbling. Todd Walburg, a personal-injury lawyer with Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein LLP, said his firm began looking into GM s ignition switches in mid-February. Walburg said the firm has been contacted by more than 200 people about the issue in the past week.
Higher stakes
It wasn t possible to verify that number and Walburg declined to say whether GM s initial recall announcement on February 13 initiated the firm s investigation or how it generated inquiries. A Google search for GM recall and GM ignition switch pulls up a sponsored ad that links to Lieff Cabraser, which also represented plaintiffs in some of the Toyota incidents.
The Justice Department s preliminary investigation raises the stakes considerably. Federal prosecutors will look at how the company handled the recalls, focusing on whether GM violated criminal or civil laws by failing to notify regulators in a timely fashion about the switch failures, according to a person familiar with the investigation who asked not to be identified discussing an open inquiry.
The chaos from the recall and the multiple investigations hits just as GM had finished shaking off the Government Motors stigma tied to the $49.5 billion US bailout that saved the automaker from liquidation.
The same week in mid-December that the government sold its last shares in the automaker, GM said it would promote Barra to CEO, the first woman to lead a major automaker. GM shares reached a post-bankruptcy high of $41.53 on December 17. Since then the shares have tumbled 15%  through Tuesday.
Improving reputation
GM s reputation with consumers had also been improving as it brought to market 18 new or updated cars and trucks, transforming its lineup into one of the freshest in the industry from one of the oldest. It also boosted quality to record levels, according to reviewers including J.D. Power & Associates and Consumer Reports magazine.
Its latest version of the Chevrolet Impala was the first US car chosen as the best sedan on the market by Consumer Reports, a first in at least 20 years, and the Cadillac CTS was picked as Motor Trend s Car of the Year for 2014.
The justice department investigation is now stealing some of that spotlight. Federal prosecutors decided to start its GM probe after discussions with officials at the Transportation Department, according to another person familiar with the inquiry who asked not to be identified.
Congressional probe
 We are in communication with the department of justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM s recall,  said Ryan Daniels, a Transportation Department spokesman.   Our timeliness investigation and our efforts to ensure GM makes consumers aware of the steps they should take in response to the recall are currently our top priorities. 
The US attorney s office in the Southern District of New York is leading the investigation. James Margolin, a spokesman for that office, declined to comment, as did Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington.
GM has hired Jenner & Block LLC Chairman Anton Valukas, who probed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. s 2008 downfall, to help lead an internal investigation.
Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Tuesday asked Barra for documents and field reports related to the recall. Committee Chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, said March 10 that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks to explore whether GM or NHTSA missed something that could have flagged these problems sooner.
2004 complaints
The initial recall on February 13 covered 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s. It was widened less than two weeks later by more than 800,000 additional vehicles. Those include 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstices and 2006-2007 Saturn Skys. Other models affected are the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada and the 2007 Opel GT sold in Europe.
NHTSA, whose decision not to investigate the switch failures years ago is also under scrutiny by Congress, is focusing on what steps GM took to investigate and rectify engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating back to at least 2004. GM has until April 3 to answer questions posed by NHTSA in a 27-page order issued last week.
Company documents show that between 2004 and the decision to initiate the recall, layers of GM engineers and corporate committees analysed and failed to fix the ignition flaw.
$35 million fine
GM has said that heavy key rings or jarring can cause the ignition switches to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. The automaker has linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including 13 deaths.
NHTSA could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the US, if it finds the automaker didn t pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective.
Sean Kane, president of Safety Research & Strategies Inc., who researches product hazards and frequently works with plaintiffs  attorneys, said the ignition-switch defect wasn t obvious enough to trigger early-on, widespread investigations by trial lawyers.
 Unless there s some reason to examine that further, a lot of crashes just go as unremarkable events,  said Kane, who testified during 2010 congressional hearings on Toyota.  With the product recall, now everyone s taking a look back.  BLOOMBERG

The human shoulder is a very strange joint in the way that it allows for maximum movement in many directions but it also has to remain stable at the same time. There is some symphony of millisecond-timed and millimeter-oriented precision that must allow the ball for staying in one tight region in relation to the socket as you keep moving.
 
While the rotator cuff and other muscles that play a big role in torn labrum surgery , there are also strong ligaments that does make it sure that ball joint stays perfectly seated in the shallow socket.
 
Surgeons usually pay attention to such ligaments only when the joint has been dislocated out of the socket and everything else might be well invisible.  However, for each patient who has dislocated a shoulder and is left with a horrible unstable joint, the doctor has to perform for individual attention. There are positive aspects in evaluating shoulder labral tear surgery which is hidden shoulder instability. The surgery used now-a-days is that of interventional orthopedics instead of orthopedic surgery and should be using placing imaging-guided injections of the advanced platelet and stem cells mixes directly into the labral tear and into the weak ligaments.
 
Top Labrum surgery means placing precise imaging guided injections of the advanced platelet and stem cell that are experienced through the downtime which is a fraction of that of surgery and in the experience of the people, the results may be better or as good as surgery.

Criminal Probe Into Recalls Complicates GM's Turnaround
Before you go, we thought you'd like these...
By Jeff Plungis, Jeff Green and Del Quentin Wilber
The criminal investigation that opened Wednesday into General Motors' handling of an ignition flaw linked to 13 deaths adds to legal challenges that threaten to overshadow the company's turnaround.
GM ( GM ), the largest U.S. automaker, is now at the beginning of a potentially years-long road dotted with inquiries, lawsuits, government fines and public skepticism. Besides the U.S. Justice Department probe, GM must answer to Congress, the Transportation Department and lawyers the company hired to investigate itself.
Toyota Motor ( TM ) is still being examined over recalls in 2009-10 related to reports of unintended acceleration in some cars. GM similarly faces repercussions for waiting to recall 1.6 million vehicles last month, even though records show it was aware as far back as 2004 of ignition switches that could slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. The crisis arrives weeks after Mary Barra took over as chief executive officer amid rising investor and consumer optimism as GM shook off the last vestiges of its 2009 bankruptcy.
"Barra is getting her feet thrown right into the fire," Dave Sullivan, an industry analyst with Southfield, Mich.-based AutoPacific, said in an interview. "There's no way she is going to come out of this looking like some kind of hero. The best thing is to be honest and upfront and hopefully put this to bed as quickly as possible."
A spokesman for Detroit-based GM, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Martin said March 10 the company was cooperating with regulators and lawmakers and that it welcomed the opportunity to help "parties have a full understanding of the facts."
Consumer Lawsuits
GM tumbled 5.1 percent to $35.18 Wednesday, its worst one-day share drop at the close since March 2012.
While the immediate financial impact of GM's recall of Chevrolet Cobalts, Pontiac G5s and other vehicles is "insignificant," some hard-to-quantify reputational risk is emerging, Joseph Spak, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note to investors Wednesday.
"Remember while this was old [pre-bankruptcy] GM, the consumer won't differentiate," Spak said. "It does appear that GM employees have known about the risk for a while, so it does seem there is a failure to act somewhere along the way."
New legal activity is already bubbling. Todd Walburg, a personal-injury lawyer with Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein, said his firm began looking into GM's ignition switches in mid-February. Walburg said the firm has been contacted by more than 200 people about the issue in the past week.
Higher Stakes
It wasn't possible to verify that number and Walburg declined to say whether GM's initial recall announcement on Feb. 13 initiated the firm's investigation or how it generated inquiries. %VIRTUAL-article-sponsoredlinks%A Google ( GOOG ) search for "GM recall" and "GM ignition switch" pulls up a sponsored ad that links to Lieff Cabraser, which also represented plaintiffs in some of the Toyota incidents.
The Justice Department's preliminary investigation raises the stakes considerably. Federal prosecutors will look at how the company handled the recalls, focusing on whether GM violated criminal or civil laws by failing to notify regulators in a timely fashion about the switch failures, according to a person familiar with the investigation who asked not to be identified discussing an open inquiry.
The chaos from the recall and the multiple investigations hits just as GM had finished shaking off the "Government Motors" stigma tied to the $49.5 billion U.S. bailout that saved the automaker from liquidation.
The same week in mid-December that the government sold its last shares in the automaker, GM said it would promote Barra to CEO, the first woman to lead a major automaker. GM shares reached a post-bankruptcy high of $41.53 on Dec. 17. Since then the shares have tumbled 15 percent through Wednesday.
Improving Reputation
GM's reputation with consumers had also been improving as it brought to market 18 new or updated cars and trucks, transforming its lineup into one of the freshest in the industry from one of the oldest. It also boosted quality to record levels, according to reviewers including J.D. Power & Associates and Consumer Reports magazine.
Its latest version of the Chevrolet Impala was the first U.S. car chosen as the best sedan on the market by Consumer Reports, a first in at least 20 years, and the Cadillac CTS was picked as Motor Trend's Car of the Year for 2014.
The Justice Department investigation is now stealing some of that spotlight. Federal prosecutors decided to start its GM probe after discussions with officials at the Transportation Department, according to another person familiar with the inquiry who asked not to be identified.
Congressional Probe
"We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall," said Ryan Daniels, a Transportation Department spokesman. "Our timeliness investigation and our efforts to ensure GM makes consumers aware of the steps they should take in response to the recall are currently our top priorities."
The U.S. Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York is leading the investigation. James Margolin, a spokesman for that office, declined to comment, as did Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman in Washington.
GM has hired Jenner & Block Chairman Anton Valukas, who probed Lehman Brothers Holdings's 2008 downfall, to help lead an internal investigation.
Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday asked Barra for documents and field reports related to the recall. Committee Chairman Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, said March 10 that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks to explore whether GM or NHTSA missed "something that could have flagged these problems sooner."
2004 Complaints
The initial recall on Feb. 13 covered 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s. It was widened less than two weeks later by more than 800,000 additional vehicles. Those include 2003-2007 Saturn Ions, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHRs, 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstices and 2006-2007 Saturn Skys. Other models affected are the 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit sold in Canada and the 2007 Opel GT sold in Europe.
NHTSA, whose decision not to investigate the switch failures years ago is also under scrutiny by Congress, is focusing on what steps GM took to investigate and rectify engineering concerns and consumer complaints dating back to at least 2004. GM has until April 3 to answer questions posed by NHTSA in a 27-page order issued last week.
Company documents show that between 2004 and the decision to initiate the recall, layers of GM engineers and corporate committees analyzed and failed to fix the ignition flaw.
$35 Million Fine
GM has said that heavy key rings or jarring can cause the ignition switches to slip out of position, cutting off power and deactivating air bags. The automaker has linked the defect to at least 23 crashes, including 13 deaths.
NHTSA could fine GM as much as $35 million, which would be the most ever by the U.S., if it finds the automaker didn't pursue a recall when it knew the cars were defective.
Sean Kane, president of Safety Research & Strategies, who researches product hazards and frequently works with plaintiffs' attorneys, said the ignition-switch defect wasn't obvious enough to trigger early-on, widespread investigations by trial lawyers.
"Unless there's some reason to examine that further, a lot of crashes just go as unremarkable events," said Kane, who testified during 2010 congressional hearings on Toyota. "With the product recall, now everyone's taking a look back."

March 12, 2014
by Tom Krisher and Dee-Ann Durbin, The Associated Press
DETROIT General Motors Co. (GM) faced more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars this week as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened probes into the matter.
The United States Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars from model years 2003 to 2007, according to a person briefed on the matter.
The probe is being handled by the U.S. Attorney s Office in New York, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the investigation has not been made public.
Representatives for the Justice Department and GM would not comment.
The investigation was first reported by Bloomberg News.
At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade.
The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths.
Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government s road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), didn t take action sooner.
GM announced last month it will replace ignition switches that can shut off car motors unexpectedly.
When that happens, drivers lose power-assisted steering and brakes and can lose control of the cars.
The ignition can slip from the run position to accessory or off, due partly to heavy key chains dangling from the steering column.
Also, if the ignition switch isn t in the run position, air bags may not inflate if a crash occurs.
An Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found that drivers started submitting complaints about the problem in early 2005, shortly after the first Chevrolet Cobalt went on sale.
The review of complaints about the Cobalt, GM s top-selling small car in the mid-2000s, found 173 instances of engine stalling or air bags failing to deploy, both symptoms of the ignition problem.
Many drivers reported problems with keys sticking in the ignition in addition to the stalling.
Fred Upton of Western Michigan, the chairman of the House committee, said in a statement that a hearing will be held in the coming weeks.
Congress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to the NHTSA.
The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.
Upton said the committee wants to know if GM or the agency missed something that could have flagged the problems sooner.
 If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,  Upton said.
The NHTSA has said the rate of problems in the GM cars was not significantly different from similar vehicles.
The prospect of congressional hearings means more bad publicity for GM, which is trying to distance itself from a reputation for building lousy cars.
The company has said it s more focused on quality since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2009.
 It s the old GM haunting the new GM,  said Jake Fisher, director of auto testing at Consumer Reports magazine.  They have a lot of the old products still hanging around. 
Fisher said GM s new cars and trucks will have to be better than the competition to lure back buyers who swore years ago to never again to buy a GM car.
The NHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the ignition problem.
The agency could fine GM up to US$35-million for a delayed response.
Automakers must report safety problems to the NHTSA within five days of learning about them.
GM said in a statement that it s co-operating with the NHTSA and the House committee.
On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Cobalts and Pontiac G5s from the 2005 to 2007 model years.
Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts from 2003 to 2007, and Chevrolet HHRs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars from 2006 and 2007.
GM said this week it has hired attorney Anton Valukas to investigate the company s actions before the recall.
Valukas investigated the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers for a bankruptcy court.
GM has promised an  unvarnished  investigation into the recall.

NYT: Justice Department Looking Into Whether GM Misled Regulators
March 12th, 2014,  8:30 AM
The New York Times reports Wednesday that the Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into General Motors  decade-long failure to address deadly safety problems before announcing a huge vehicle recall last month, according to people briefed on the matter.
Bill Vlasic and Ben Protess write that federal prosecutors in New York focus on whether GM failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects. The prosecutors are question whether GM misled federal regulators about the extent of problems.
News of the federal probe heighten the stakes in a major challenge for Mary Barra, the compamny's new CEO.
The investigation is the latest in a widening series of threats to GM over its handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.
On Tuesday, Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, said he would ask Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, to hold hearings on a panel that oversees consumer product safety. The hearings are expected to begin within weeks.
A House committee said on Monday that it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM's recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide, and it sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
That agency is also investigating GM's actions since the company first learned of possible defects in its ignition systems, in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll of fatal accidents.

(Newser)                                   General Motors is facing more pressure over its handling of a deadly defect in certain compact cars as word leaked of a criminal investigation and two congressional committees opened inquiries into the matter. The Justice Department is investigating whether GM broke any laws with its slow response to a problem with ignition switches in compact cars, including the Cobalt, from model years 2003 to 2007, says a person briefed on the matter. The probe is being handled by the US Attorney's Office in New York and is in its early stages, reports Reuters .
At issue is why GM waited until February to recall 1.6 million older-model compact cars worldwide, even though it admitted knowing about the problem for a decade. The faulty ignition switches have been linked to 31 crashes and 13 deaths. Committees in the House and Senate also want to know why the government's road safety watchdog, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, didn't take action sooner. If no criminal charges result, federal prosecutors could pursue civil charges, notes the New York Times .

Federal prosecutors open criminal probe of GM recall: source

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are examining whether General Motors is criminally liable for failing to properly disclose problems with some of its vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths and led to a recall last month, according to a source familiar with the investigation.
The New York-based probe is in its early stages, and the source did not elaborate on the legal theory behind the potential criminal liability.
Federal investigators are reviewing information about how GM handled reports of problems with ignition switches that first came to light 10 years ago, according to the source.
The source did not want to be named because the probe has not been disclosed publicly.
GM declined to comment on Tuesday. Shares of GM closed down 5 percent to $35.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The federal probe by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan adds to a growing list of U.S. authorities examining the recall, which GM announced in February. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) previously opened an investigation into whether GM reacted swiftly enough in its recall.
Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that a U.S. Senate committee chairman is seeking a hearing on the issue. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also ordered GM and NHTSA to turn over information about GM's ignition switch problems.
The problems in some instances allowed the engine and other components, including front airbags, to turn off while the vehicle was traveling at high speed. More than 1.6 million older vehicles are affected.
The failure is believed to be caused when weight on the ignition key, road conditions or some other jarring event causes the ignition switch to move out of the "run" position, turning off the engine and most of the car's electrical components mid-drive, with sometimes catastrophic results.
GM has recommended that owners use only the ignition key with nothing else on the key ring.
The supplier of the ignition switch, Delphi Automotive Plc, said in a statement on Tuesday that the part had not been provided to any other automaker.
One analyst said the recall could have a longer-term impact on GM. "The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share," RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said.
"Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM," he said.
TWO WEEKS TO RESPOND
GM is conducting an internal investigation into the matter and announced earlier this week that the probe would be led by Anton "Tony" Valukas, the chairman of law firm Jenner & Block.
The criminal probe of GM opened by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara follows an investigation conducted by the same office into Toyota's disclosure in 2009 of driver complaints of unintended acceleration by some of its vehicles.
Toyota has been engaged in negotiations with Bharara's office to settle that probe, which is also criminal, a source familiar with the investigation previously told Reuters.
The House committee examining the GM issue, led by Michigan Republican Fred Upton, gave the company and NHTSA until March 25 to turn over information about their responses to consumers' complaints about the problem.
The committee has asked GM officials to provide a briefing no later than March 18 on how GM has responded to reports of incidents since 2003 and its interaction with NHTSA since then on problems related to the ignition defect.
Upton led the 2000 investigation into Firestone tire failures on Ford Motor Co vehicles, resulting in the TREAD Act that requires automakers to report complaints of defects to the NHTSA.
That law also makes it a crime to intentionally mislead the agency about defects that lead to serious accidents.
The Justice Department can only open a grand jury investigation into such allegations at the request of the U.S. Transportation Secretary, according to the law.
"We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall," a Transportation Department spokesman said in a statement.
The person familiar with the criminal probe declined to discuss whether prosecutors were considering liability under the TREAD Act.

Congress Looking at GM Safety Issue
Tuesday
Mar 11, 2014 at 12:01 AM Mar 12, 2014 at 12:08 AM
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DETROIT | A congressional committee is investigating the way General Motors and a federal safety agency handled a deadly ignition switch problem in compact cars.
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration received a large number of complaints about the problem during the past decade. But GM didn't recall the 1.6 million cars worldwide until last month.
Ignition switches on older-model Chevrolet Cobalts and five other GM models can shift from the "run" position to "accessory" or "off" without warning, shutting off the engine and turning off power-assisted steering and brakes. The problem also can stop the front air bags from inflating in a crash. GM says 13 deaths and 31 crashes have been linked to the problem.
Upton says the committee will seek information from the automaker and hold a hearing in the coming weeks. A Senate subcommittee hearing also is possible.
Congress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to NHTSA. The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.
Upton said in a statement that the committee wants to know whether GM or the agency missed something that could have flagged the problems sooner.
"If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended," Upton said.
An Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found dozens of driver complaints about the problem, some as early as 2005. GM has admitted in documents filed with NHTSA that it knew of the problem in 2004.
NHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the problem. The company could be fined up to $35 million if the agency finds it responded too slowly. Automakers are required to report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them.
GM, in a statement issued Monday night, said it is cooperating with NHTSA "and will do so with the committee, too. We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts." GM already has admitted that its processes weren't effective enough when the problem first surfaced.
A spokesman for NHTSA said Tuesday morning that he was checking on a response.
On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it added 842,000 Saturn Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007).

TU seeks former/current owners of recalled GMs who've had trouble with one or more of recalled vehicles
The Times-Union is seeking anyone who s experienced troubled or been involved in any accidents in GM vehicles involved in a massive nationwide recall due to faulty ignition switches, which have been attributed to at least 13 deaths.
MORE ON THE STORY
Questions and answers on the recall
The switches may allow the key to unintentionally move or switch to the  accessory  or  off  position, turning off the engine and most of the electrical components on the vehicle, according to a press release from GM. The recall condition may have caused or contributed to the non-deployment of the frontal airbags, the release said.

Culture at GM blamed for recall delay
By KEITH NAUGHTON
BLOOMBERG NEWS | 
Wire Service
At the heart of General Motors Corp.'s slow response to fatally flawed ignition switches is a committee culture that impeded the flow of information from the engineering ranks to the corner office.
Associated press
GM
The company began investigating reports of faulty switches in 2004. Yet Mary Barra, the new chief executive officer, wrote March 4 that GM's top executives, including herself, didn't know of the situation until a "few weeks ago."
Company documents show that during that period, multiple layers of engineers and corporate committees analyzed and failed to fix a flaw that led to the deaths of 13 people. GM told authorities that before announcing the recall, the company engaged in several internal probes featuring an array of committees that left federal bureaucrats baffled.
Now, as it tries to shake off a humbling bankruptcy and period of government stewardship, GM is grappling with a damaging recall of 1.6 million cars. In the coming months, the world's second-largest automaker will replace switches that could slip out of the "on" position when jarred or used with heavy key rings, cutting off power and deactivating air bags.
"At the old, lethargic, slow-moving GM, people didn't want to push bad news upward," said George Cook, a former Ford Motor Co. executive who is now an executive professor of marketing at the University of Rochester's Simon Business School. "They laid on it way too long. You can't gamble with people's lives."
The House Energy and Commerce Committee will explore whether the automaker or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration missed "something that could have flagged these problems sooner," Fred Upton, the panel's chairman and a Michigan Republican, said in a statement Monday night. GM said it would fully cooperate with the panel.
In the Senate, Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat, has asked for a subcommittee hearing on the matter from Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said a person familiar with the matter. The Detroit News reported the request earlier.
For Barra, the recall poses a challenge: Can the new CEO change the culture at a company where she has worked for 34 years? The recall, issued a month after she became CEO on Jan. 15, risks harming GM's reputation just as it tries to shake the "Government Motors" tag from its federally funded bankruptcy.
"We're looking for evidence that they can move more quickly," said Brian Johnson, an auto analyst for Barclays. "The committee culture of the old GM was rooted in organizational paralysis and characterized by a lack of accountability."
Still, while the cars involved were built before the 2009 bankruptcy, the slow-motion investigation into the ignition switches continued after GM was reborn as a supposedly leaner organization.
The cars recalled were the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevy HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice, 2007 Saturn Sky, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit in Canada and 2007 Open GT in Europe.
Greg Martin, a spokesman for GM, said the automaker had "nothing further to add to the previous statements" it had made.
Barra has a responsibility to explain what took so long, said Joan Claybrook, a former NHTSA administrator and a longtime consumer advocate.
Claybrook said it suggests a "failure of communications at General Motors on a massive scale, so that the various sections of the company didn't talk to each other about the need for a recall."

GM says faulty ignition switches in some of its models have been linked to 31 accidents and 13 fatalities.

NEW YORK  
The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into the decadelong failure by General Motors to address deadly safety problems in some of its cars before announcing a massive recall last month, according to a person briefed on the matter.
The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is expected to center on whether GM, the nation s largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects.

A House committee on Monday said it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM s recall of 1.6 million vehicles, and sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
NHTSA is also investigating GM s actions since the company first learned of possible defects in its ignition systems in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own internal review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll accidents.
It is rare but not unprecedented for the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against an auto company for how it handles recalls.

The department, for example, is currently in discussions with Toyota about settling a four-year criminal investigation into how the Japanese automaker disclosed complaints related to unintended acceleration of its vehicles.
The GM inquiry, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company s admission to NHTSA on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches at various times over the past 10 years but never moved to fix or replace the parts.
When asked on Tuesday about the criminal inquiry, a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, declined to comment.
One safety advocate said the Justice Department investigation is likely to center on whether GM withheld information from regulators in violation of the Safety Act.
 It s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,  said Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington.

A US congressional committee has said it is investigating General Motors' recall of nearly 1.6 million vehicles over faulty ignition switches.
The problem could turn off the engine in affected vehicles while they were being driven, disabling the airbags.
The carmaker announced the recall last month, but it has admitted employees knew about the defect as early as 2004.

US highway safety agency abetted GM cover-up of defect linked to fatal crashes
By     Shannon Jones
12 March 2014
Clear evidence has surfaced revealing the complicity of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the prolonged cover-up of a defect in General Motors vehicles tied to at least 13 fatalities. The deaths related to frontal crashes in which airbags did not deploy.
In February GM issued a recall of 1.6 million vehicles worldwide due to a problem with the ignition system of certain models, which can shift unexpectedly out of the  run  position causing the engine to cut off while driving. The recall involves the 2005 2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, the 2003 2007 Saturn Ion and four other models. The company could face civil as well as criminal penalties for failing to respond to the problem in a timely manner.
On Monday the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it would hold hearings on the protracted delay by GM in announcing the recall. For its part, GM has shifted into full damage control mode, appointing a high-profile attorney to lead an internal investigation of the matter.
According to a March 8 report in the New York Times, the NHTSA received more than 260 complaints over the last 11 years about the safety defect, but refused to carry out an investigation. The complaints involved the cars  engines suddenly cutting off, sometimes at high speeds, seriously impairing steering and braking. The defect can also lead to the failure of the air bag to deploy in the event of a crash.
In one case, a woman in New Jersey informed the NHTSA and GM in June 2005 that her daughter s 2005 Cobalt shut down completely three times while in operation, including in traffic. Both the mother and daughter brought the matter to the attention of the dealer, who merely suggested removing extra keys from the keychain. When the problem continued they terminated the lease at a cost of thousands of dollars.
While GM has only publicly admitted to 31 crashes linked to the defect, a review of NHTSA records shows there were at least 78 deaths and 1,581 injuries since 2003 involving the now recalled cars. How many were linked to the defect is not known at this time.
According to a timeline released by GM management, the automaker was aware of the problem in 2004, but rejected a fix proposed by engineers. By the end of 2007 GM knew of at least 10 frontal crashes in which airbags did not deploy, but still refused to issue a recall order.
Documents from a lawsuit show that in 2005 GM issued a technical service bulletin for the Cobalt for engine stalling as a result of the key moving in the ignition. The suit was filed by the parents of a 29-year-old Georgia woman, Brooke Melton, who died in a March 2010 crash while driving her 2005 Cobalt. The ignition switch had shifted out of the  on  position at the time of the crash. Melton s death is not included in GM s count of 13 people killed in frontal crashes where airbags failed to deploy.
The case also forced GM to turn over documents showing that it bought back at least 13 Cobalts from customers who complained about engines stalling or power loss as early as the spring of 2005. During a deposition related to the case, attorneys for the Melton family also learned that GM set up a team headed by a high-ranking company executive in 2011 to investigate the ignition problem.
The defect has led to an undisclosed number of lawsuits against GM. Those seeking to sue GM for the deaths of family members are being told that the automaker is not liable for claims arising from incidents or accidents prior to July 2009 when it emerged from bankruptcy.
The NHTSA, the government agency that is supposed to serve as a watchdog over the auto manufacturers, was well aware of the problem by 2007. Crashes involving Cobalts triggered three Special Crash Investigations seeking to determine why new  smart  airbags were not deploying.
One investigation looked at a fatal crash in Wisconsin involving a 2005 Cobalt in which the airbag did not inflate. The report noted that the ignition switch was not in the  on  position at the time of the crash. The NHTSA also noted that it had at least six complaints on record where the engine suddenly shut off on the Cobalt.
Center for Auto Safety Executive Director Clarence Ditlow spoke to the World Socialist Web Site about the GM recall.  The first responsibility is General Motors. But it is a broader problem,  he said.  The NHTSA knew about it. There was an accident in Maryland that identified the problem. They had a meeting about it, but there are no records. When you have the auto industry and NHTSA work behind closed doors you get dirty deals like this. The NHTSA identified the defect in 2007, but failed to act. 
He indicated that the 13 deaths related to the defect were likely only the tip of the iceberg.  Thirteen is what GM admits to, but it doesn t include the Melton death. 
Ditlow compared the present crisis to the recall of the Ford Pinto in the 1970s whose gas tank could easily rupture, causing a fire.  I would rank it with the Pinto it is one of the worst defects ever and you have such a clear cover-up. 
The cover-up of the defect with the Cobalt also recalls the 2000 recall involving the failure of Firestone tires on the Ford Explorer sports utility vehicle. Both companies were well aware of the problem, which was eventually tied to more than 200 deaths, but failed to take any action for years. For its part the NHTSA had been alerted to the fact that the tires were separating from their treads by insurance researchers, but also failed to act.
In the wake of that recall Congress enacted legislation requiring automakers to more promptly report accidents related to safety defects. But with the Cobalt, GM simply ignored the law, abetted by government regulators.
The revelations in the latest recall point to the systematic dismantling of serious oversight of safety throughout US industry. It follows decades in which safety regulations covering everything from automobiles to food and medicine have been gutted in the name of  free market  principles and government oversight agencies staffed with frontmen for big business.
A case in point is David Strickland, the former head of the NHTSA, who resigned in late 2013 to take a job with a law firm that deals in auto regulation. The company, Venable LLP, gained notoriety for its role in fighting the moratorium on offshore drilling following the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Strickland has been assigned to work on the firm s regulatory group, which represents automakers on a number of issues, including matters before the NHTSA.

Federal prosecutors are investigating General Motors (NYSE:GM), or GM, to find out whether it is criminally liable for not disclosing problems with its vehicles that were linked to 13 deaths and 31 accidents in the past decade, forcing the company to recall 1.6 million vehicles worldwide in February, news reports said citing sources.
The investigators are reportedly examining how GM handled reports of faulty ignition switches, which were first revealed in 2004, and why the company did not react sooner to fix the problem, the New York Times reported Tuesday. The investigation will also address the question of whether GM tried to mislead federal regulators about the extent of its problems that led to the production of faulty switches, which reportedly caused cars to shut down unexpectedly and disabled the airbags.
 It s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,  Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, a private watchdog group said, according to the Times.

Detroit-based GM, which is also conducting an internal investigation into the matter, reportedly announced this week that Anton "Tony" Valukas, the chairman of law firm Jenner & Block will lead the internal probe, according to Reuters.
A Department of Transportation spokesman said in a statement, according to Reuters: "We are in communication with the Department of Justice but have not asked Justice to investigate because we are still in the midst of our own investigation regarding the timing of GM's recall." 
The GM recalls involve six models that are not being currently produced -- 2005-07 Chevrolet Cobalts; the 2007 Pontiac G5; 2003-07 Saturn Ions; 2006-07 Chevrolet HHRs; 2006-07 Pontiac Solstices; and the 2007 Saturn Sky -- and the company could be charged up to $35 million in fines by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, if GM is found guilty of not reacting promptly to the complaints, Bloomberg reported.
The initial recall on Feb. 13 covered 778,562 Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s and widened to include a further 800,000 vehicles within the next two weeks.
GM stock plummeted 5.15 percent on Monday at close. 
 The immediate financial impact is insignificant; however, there could be some reputational risk which could impact share,  RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said, according to Reuters.  Obviously, the longer this stays in the headlines the worse it could be for GM.

GM facing most costly recall... ever?

General Motors veteran Mary Barra. AFP    
General Motors is facing questions over why it took nearly a decade to recall 1.6 million cars sold in North America for defects that have been tied to 13 deaths.
The world's number three automaker is now facing two official probes over the issue, one from the government's National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, and a second from a powerful congressional committee, asking why both GM and the NHTSA were so slow to move after hundreds of complaints.
Republican Congressman Fred Upton said the House Energy and Commerce Committee would hold hearings in the coming weeks.
Upton noted that he pushed through legislation in 2000 aimed at ensuring automakers reported and acted on defects before they became an ongoing problem.
"Yet, here we are over a decade later, faced with accidents and tragedies, and significant questions need to be answered," he said.
That was bad news for GM, and its shares tumbled 5.2 percent to $35.18 on Tuesday.
GM employees already knew in 2004 and 2005 of ignition problems in the Chevrolet Cobalt, according to an official chronology from investigators, seen by AFP.
Drivers said the ignition turned off by itself, while they were moving. That would shut down electrical systems, including the safety air bags, as shown in a number of accidents.
Over the years, more reports came in, including links to crashes in which the airbags did not deploy, resulting in sometimes fatal injuries.
But it was only last month that any concrete action was taken, and even then, haltingly.
At first, GM announced a recall involving 780 000 cars in the US, Canada and Mexico, saying the ignition could be jarred from "run" position to "accessory" or "off", especially if the vehicle was off-road or the key ring was particularly heavy.
GM said it knew of 22 crashes involving frontal impact where the front seat airbags did not deploy, with six deaths resulting.
But the automaker added that all of the fatal crashes "occurred off-road and at high speeds, where the probability of serious or fatal injuries was high regardless of airbag deployment."
Just 12 days later the company expanded the recall to 1.6 million cars, saying it had recorded 31 crashes in which the defect may have stopped the airbags from deploying, and 13 deaths.
The list of cars was expanded to six popular models manufactured between 2003 and 2007: Chevrolet Cobalt and HHR, Pontiac G5, Pursuit and Solstice, and Saturn Ion and Sky.
The initial investigation was "not as robust as it should have been," admitted GM North America President Alan Batey.
"We are deeply sorry and we are working to address this issue as quickly as we can."
The recall is the first big crisis for new chief executive Mary Barra, who took the company's helm on 15 January as the first woman to lead a major automaker.
Last week she announced an internal review into why the company was slow to act, promising an "unvarnished" report.
The review will be led by a respected lawyer, Anton Valukas, who earlier led an examination of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
"I deeply regret the circumstances that brought us to this point," Barra said in a memo to employees on the company's website.
"We will hold ourselves accountable and improve our processes so our customers do not experience this again."
Barra's transparency recognises the damages the company faces. In 2009-2010, Toyota was forced to call back some 12 million vehicles worldwide at a cost of $2.4-billion.
The Japanese company's executives were forced to appear in Congressional hearings, where they were sharply denounced for allegedly hiding and downplaying dangerous defects in some of the company's most popular models.
GM faces only small official fines at the moment: a possible $35-million, minute compared to $155-billion in revenues last year.
But analyst Douglas McIntyre at 24/7 Wall Street said ultimately GM's recall "could prove to be one of the most costly in automotive history," running "well into the billions of dollars".
"The legal liability triggered by what could be thousands of personal injury lawsuits may be just as damaging to the reputation of GM's important brands," he said.

Justice Department opens criminal inquiry into GM recall

The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation into the decade-long failure by General Motors to address deadly safety problems in some of its cars before announcing a massive recall last month, according to a person briefed on the matter.
The preliminary inquiry by federal prosecutors in New York is expected to center on whether GM, the nation s largest automaker, failed to comply with laws requiring timely disclosure of vehicle defects.
The action is the latest in a widening series of investigations of GM s handling of faulty ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt sedan and other cars that the company says are linked to 31 accidents and 13 deaths.
On Tuesday, Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he would ask Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to hold hearings on a panel that oversees consumer product safety. The hearings are expected to begin within weeks, a spokesman for Rockefeller said.
A House committee on Monday said it would conduct its own investigation and hearings into events leading to GM s recall of 1.6 million vehicles, and sent letters demanding extensive records to the company and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The NHTSA is also investigating GM s actions since the company first learned of possible defects in its ignition systems in 2004. And GM has hired outside lawyers to lead its own internal review of why it failed to fix or replace switches tied to a mounting toll of fatal accidents.
It is rare but not unprecedented for the Justice Department to consider criminal charges against an auto company for how it handles recalls.
The department, for example, is currently in discussions with Toyota about settling a four-year criminal investigation into how the Japanese automaker disclosed complaints related to the unintended acceleration of its vehicles.
The GM inquiry, while still in its early stages, reflects the escalating reaction among government officials to the company s admission to NHTSA on Feb. 24 that it knew of problems with ignition switches at various times over the past 10 years but never moved to fix or replace the parts.
When asked Tuesday about the criminal inquiry, a GM spokesman, Greg Martin, declined to comment. Bloomberg News first reported the investigation.
One safety advocate said the Justice Department investigation is likely to center on whether GM withheld information from government regulators in violation of a criminal penalty provision of the Safety Act.
 It s high time for the Justice Department to conduct criminal investigations of automakers who conceal defects and people die,  said Clarence Ditlow, head of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington.
Ditlow said the inquiry would probably parallel a special order by NHTSA demanding that GM answer 107 detailed questions about its internal actions and the people involved.
 To impose the criminal penalties, Justice has to find who did the criminal act,  Ditlow said.  NHTSA s Special Order has multiple questions on who the individuals were in the various acts that resulted in a 10-year delay. 
A House committee is also stepping up pressure on GM to disclose records and documents related to the ignition switches.
Letters signed by Republican and Democratic leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee were sent Monday night to GM s chief executive, Mary Barra, and David Friedman, the acting head of NHTSA.
In the letters, the committee called for all records of consumer complaints, field reports and reports of deaths, injuries or property damage.
The committee also said it wanted  a detailed timeline of interactions and communications between GM and NHTSA related to stalls, air bags and/or ignition switches in the GM vehicles subject to recall. 
The letters gave the company and the agency until March 25 to reply.
The committee chairman, Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the House inquiry is geared toward finding out whether GM and government regulators complied with reporting requirements in the Tread Act, which was designed to streamline the flow of information on vehicle problems between carmakers and NHTSA.
 We must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress intended to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended,  Upton said in a prepared statement.
Once the committee gets the requested information, it is expected to hold hearings that could include testimony by Barra and other GM officials.

DETROIT
A congressional committee is investigating the way General Motors and a federal safety agency handled a deadly ignition switch problem in compact cars.
House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton of Michigan says the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration received a large number of complaints about the problem during the past decade. But GM didn't recall the 1.6 million cars worldwide until last month.
Ignition switches on older-model Chevrolet Cobalts and five other GM models can shift from the "run" position to "accessory" or "off" without warning, shutting off the engine and turning off power-assisted steering and brakes. The problem also can stop the front air bags from inflating in a crash. GM says 13 deaths and 31 crashes have been linked to the problem.
Upton says the committee will seek information from the automaker and hold a hearing in the coming weeks. A Senate subcommittee hearing also is possible.
Congress passed legislation in 2000 requiring automakers to report safety problems quickly to NHTSA. The laws came after an investigation into a series of Ford-Firestone tire problems.
Upton said in a statement that the committee wants to know if GM or the agency missed something that could have flagged the problems sooner.
"If the answer is yes, we must learn how and why this happened, and then determine whether this system of reporting and analyzing complaints that Congress created to save lives is being implemented and working as the law intended," Upton said.
An Associated Press review of a NHTSA database found dozens of driver complaints about the problem, some as early as 2005. GM has admitted in documents filed with NHTSA that it knew of the problem in 2004.
NHTSA already has demanded information from GM about when it knew of the problem. The company could be fined up to $35 million if the agency finds it responded too slowly. Automakers are required to report safety problems to NHTSA within five days of learning about them.
GM, in a statement issued Monday night, said it is cooperating with NHTSA "and will do so with the committee, too. We welcome the opportunity to help both parties have a full understanding of the facts." GM already has admitted that its processes weren't effective enough when the problem first surfaced.
A spokesman for NHTSA said Tuesday morning that he was checking on a response.

General Motors is coming under mounting criticism for its handling of a serious defect. Last month, the company recalled 1.6 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches linked to 13 deaths. The cars, made from 2003-2007, could stall or fail to deploy their airbags.
It's an issue GM has known about for a while, and now Congress wants to know why it took the automaker almost a decade to warn the public about it.
When there is an accident with a car that could involve new technology or a defect, the government sends in a team: the special crash investigators .
Allan Kam, a retired senior attorney for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, says when investigators for the government first heard rumblings of problems with the now-discontinued Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, they filed a report.
The report, he says, "indicated loss of power and it was a kind of report which should have raised all kinds of red flags in the agency. It should have been referred to the Office of Defects Investigation to consider opening up a formal investigation."
It turns out the problem was the ignition. Essentially, a heavy keychain can put the ignition switch into the wrong position: Like when your car is sort of halfway on, and just the lights and radio are working but you can't drive.
Kam says NHTSA can only investigate problems that are brought to its attention. Carmakers are always hearing about potential defects from dealers, consumers and suppliers. GM had the first inklings of the problem 10 years ago.
"What you have is a failure, an apparent failure, of General Motors to make a defect determination which would result in a mandatory recall in a timely manner," Kam says. "And we're not talking here just about weeks and months   we're talking about years."
When a car company finds out about a defect, it's supposed to let authorities know within five days. NHTSA is asking GM what it knew and when.
The company has opened its own investigation and it hired a former U.S. attorney to lead the inquiry.
Now Congress has opened its own inquiry. Republican Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania is on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating . He says he wants to know what GM knew and what the government knew as well.
"It sounds like there was enough loose ends here, enough data taking place that at least in retrospect we see there were trends pointing to a deadly problem," Murphy says. "And I want to know what each side knew."
Jack Nerad, with Kelley Blue Book, says the auto industry and its regulators work closely together.
"Well, I think NHTSA is viewed now as a part of the industry," Nerad says. NHTSA walks the line that any agency must when it oversees an industry, he says. "Well, I think most often NHTSA and the industry work together quite well. I think there is good, healthy give and take. One can question occasionally how quickly they move."
By law it doesn't matter necessarily how quickly the government moves   carmakers have a responsibility to point out problems. How quickly GM moves, however, could have wider effects.
"GM is a really a very special case because there really is an old GM and a new GM," says Jake Fisher, with Consumer Reports. He says the Cobalt is a sign of how bad the old GM was.
"It wasn't pretty. We weren't fans of the Cobalt. It was [an] uncompetitive vehicle that wasn't reliable."
Fisher says the company has improved tremendously in the last several years, but that may not matter.
"The vehicles of the old GM, which is ... the majority of the fleet out there, those bad experiences are having with those vehicles is going to make them not want to give the new GM a chance," he says. "Forget about the recall. Even in the best situation [if it's] not a very good car, why would you want to come back to GM."
In addition to the Cobalt, the recall includes the Chevrolet HHR, the Pontiac G5 and Solstice and the Saturn Ion and Sky.

And I'm Robert Siegel. General Motors is coming under mounting criticism for its handling of a serious defect. Last month the company recalled 1.6 million vehicles because of faulty ignition switches. They've been linked to 13 deaths. The cars could stall or fail to deploy their airbags. It's an issue GM has known about for a while and now Congress wants to know why it took the automaker almost a decade to warn the public about it.
NPR's Sonari Glinton reports.
SONARI GLINTON, BYLINE: When there's an accident with a car that could involve new technology or defect, the government sends in a team, the Special Crash Investigators, or SCI unit. Allan Kam is a retired senior attorney for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA. He says when investigators for the government first heard rumblings of problems with the now-discontinued Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5, they filed a report.
ALLAN KAM: The SCI report indicated loss of power and it was a kind of report which should have raised all kinds of red flags in the agency. It should have been referred to the Office of Defects Investigation to consider opening up a formal investigation.
GLINTON: It turns out the problem was the ignition. Essentially a heavy keychain can put the ignition switch into the wrong position. You know how when your car is sort of halfway on, and just the lights and radio are working, but you can't drive? That's what was happening. Kam says NHTSA can only investigate problems that are brought to its attention. Carmakers are always hearing about potential defects from dealers, consumers and suppliers, and GM had the first inklings 10 years ago.
KAM: What you have is a failure, an apparent failure, of General Motors to make a defect determination which would, you know, result in a mandatory recall in a timely manner. And we're not talking here just about weeks and months, we're talking about years.
GLINTON: When a car company finds out about a defect, it's supposed to let authorities know within five days. NHTSA is asking GM what did it know and when. General Motors has opened its own investigation and it hired a former U.S. attorney to lead. Now Congress has opened its own probe. Republican Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania is on the House committee that's investigating. He says he wants to know what GM knew and what the government knew as well.
REPRESENTATIVE TIM MURPHY: It sounds like there was enough loose ends here, enough data taking place that at least in retrospect. We see there were trends pointing to a deadly problem and I want to know what each side knew.
JACK NERAD: Well, I think NHTSA is viewed now as a part of the industry.

Flight MH370: Debris images Chinese 'mistake'
13 March 2014 Last updated at 11:09 GMT
Chinese satellite images that were said to show debris from a missing Malaysian airliner were released by mistake, Malaysia's transport minister has said.
Hishammuddin Hussein also denied a US report that the plane might have flown for hours after contact was lost with the Boeing 777.
In a news briefing the Mr Hussein, said that the "images were released by mistake" by the Chinese, "and did not show any debris from MH370".

Adding to the mystery, The Wall Street Journal reported that US investigators suspect the plane flew on for four hours once it lost contact with air traffic controllers.
By Chris Brummitt and Joan Lowy Associated Press 
March 13, 2014
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP)   A Malaysia Airlines plane sent signals to a satellite for four hours after the aircraft went missing, an indication that it was still flying for hundreds of miles or more, a U.S. official briefed on the search said Thursday.
Six days after the plane with 239 people aboard disappeared, Malaysian authorities expanded their search westward toward India, saying the aircraft may have flown for several hours after its last contact with the ground shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing.

A string of previous clues about Flight MH370 have led nowhere.
  MH370 went completely silent over the open ocean,   said Malaysia s acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein.   This is a crisis situation. It is a very complex operation, and it is not obviously easy. We are devoting all our energies to the task at hand.

The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn t authorized to discuss the situation by name, said the Boeing 777-200 wasn t transmitting data to the satellite, but was instead sending out a signal to establish contact.
What s known and unknown
Boeing offers a satellite service that can receive a stream of data during flight on how the aircraft is functioning and relay the information to the plane s home base. The idea is to provide information before the plane lands on whether maintenance work or repairs are needed.
Malaysia Airlines didn t subscribe to that service, but the plane still had the capability to connect with the satellite and was automatically sending pings, the official said.

  It s like when your cellphone is off but it still sends out a little  I'm here  message to the cellphone network,   the official said.   That s how sometimes they can triangulate your position even though you re not calling because the phone every so often sends out a little bleep. That s sort of what this thing was doing.  
The plane had enough fuel to fly about four more hours, the U.S. official said.
Boeing did not comment.
Messages involving a different, more rudimentary data service also were received from the airliner for a short time after the plane s transponder   a device used to identify the plane to radar   went silent, the official said.
If the plane had disintegrated during flight or had suffered some other catastrophic failure, all signals   the pings to the satellite, the data messages and the transponder   would be expected to stop at the same time.
One part of the hunt is in the South China Sea, where the aircraft was seen on civilian radar flying northeast before vanishing without any indication of technical problems. A similar-sized search is also being conducted in the Strait of Malacca because of military radar sightings that might indicate the plane turned in that direction after its last contact, passing over the Malay Peninsula.
The total search area being covered is about 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometers)   about the size of Portugal.
Asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said:   Of course. We can t rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search. We are expanding our search into the Andaman Sea.   The sea is northwest of the Malay Peninsula.
He said Malaysia was asking for radar data from India and other neighboring countries to see if they can trace it flying northwest. India says its navy, air force and coast guard will search for the plane in the south Andaman Sea.
  Because of new information, we may be part of an effort to open a new search area in the Indian Ocean,   White House spokesman Jay Carney said earlier Thursday, declining to offer additional details about that information or the new area.
The U.S. Navy 7th Fleet said it is moving one of its ships, the USS Kidd, into the Strait of Malacca, west of Malaysia.
In the latest disappointment, search planes failed to find any debris from the plane after they were sent Thursday to an area of the South China Sea off the southern tip of Vietnam, where satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects.
  There is nothing. We went there. There is nothing,   Hishammuddin said.
More than two-thirds of those on Flight MH370 were from China, which has shown impatience with the absence of any results. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Thursday in Beijing he would like to see better coordination among countries in the search.
The passengers    families and friends are burning with anxiety. The Chinese government and Chinese people are all deeply concerned about their safety,   he said at the close of the annual session of the country s legislature.   As long as there is a glimmer of hope, we will not stop searching for the plane.  
He said China had eight ships and 10 satellites searching for the plane.
Malaysia has been criticized for its handling of the search, in part because it took several days to fully explain why it couldn t say whether the plane had turned back. Officials say they are not hiding anything and are searching areas where the plane is most likely to be, while trying to establish its actual location.
Besides the Chinese satellite photos and the so-far fruitless search based on the possible sighting on military radar, there have been other developments in the aviation mystery that have failed to lead to finding the plane or the cause of its disappearance:
  Oil slicks seen Saturday were found to have nothing to do with the jetliner.
  A yellow object spotted by a search plane turned out to be ordinary sea trash.
  Officials initially said four or five passengers checked in for the flight but did not board, fueling speculation about terrorism. Officials later said some people with reservations never checked in and were simply replaced by standby passengers, and no baggage was removed.
  Officials said two men, later identified as Iranians, boarded the plane with stolen passports. It was later reported that they were unlikely to be linked to terrorist groups.
Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the plane s disappearance.
Experts say one possibility that could explain why the transponders were not working is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.
Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean, some debris should be floating even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.
Associated Press reporters Jim Gomez in Kuala Lumpur and Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report.

Missing Malaysia airline said to have flown west with beacon off
The aviation specialists say evidence suggests the MH370 flight travelled west over Malaysia for hours

Washington: The missing plane Malaysia Airlines MH370 kept flying after it dropped off controllers  radar screens, raising new questions about whether foul play was involved,according to people familiar with data gathered in the inquiry.
Aviation specialists investigating last week s loss of MH370 say evidence gathered so far suggests the plane travelled west over Malaysia, possibly continuing for hours, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the probe is active.
 News reports that the aircraft may have continued flying for some time after the last transmission of engine data are inaccurate,  acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in Kuala Lumpur.
The comments by investigators adds a new note of mystery to the 8 March disappearance of the Malaysian Airline System BHD . plane carrying 239 people that vanished while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Data compiled so far show no evidence of a crash near the Malaysian peninsula, the people said.  The airline has no information on this,  a spokeswoman at Malaysian Air said, declining to be identified.
 I can t think of a single example of a large airplane completely disappearing without seemingly leaving a trace for this many days,  said Hans Weber, president of Tecop International Inc. , a San Diego-based consultant.  It remains a mystery. 
 US investigators increasingly suspect the act was criminal,  one person said without elaborating.
Fuel reserves
Radar signals sent from the ground continued to reflect back from the plane after its transponder went dead as the aircraft headed north from Malaysia toward Vietnam, said the people, who weren t permitted to speak publicly about the probe.
After the transponder shut off, making it harder to follow on radar, the plane turned left toward the west instead of continuing on its path. An automatic system that sends data about the health of the plane s engines may also have continued to function, indicating the aircraft was being operated intentionally, the people said.
 That suggests The Boeing Co. 777-200 may have been flown off course with the intent to fly undetected, by the pilots or hijackers. Malaysia isn t cutting back on the search, and instead has intensified its efforts,  Hishammuddin said.
 Malaysia has nothing to hide,  he said.  We have spared no expense and no effort. 
Andaman Sea
The 777 had enough fuel to fly the 2,700 miles (4,345km) to Beijing and reserves to fly to a diversion airport. That meant it was capable of flying at least 2,000 miles after it changed course. The Wall Street Journal reported that the plane stayed in the air for about four hours after reaching its last confirmed location.
The aircraft s transponder normally sends radio beacons to ground radar stations making it easier to follow and providing other information, such as its identity and altitude. While it s possible for it to malfunction or be accidentally switched it off, it is highly suspicious for the device to fail at the same time a plane makes an abrupt change of course.
 The plane continued to fly west toward the Andaman Sea, only dropping off Malaysian radars as it reached the end of their range,  the people said.  The information raises as many questions as it answers about the case and was still being assessed by officials. 
 Indian Navy and Coast Guard have sent ships and aircraft to aid Malaysia in its search for the missing plane,  said a government official, who asked not to be identified as the person wasn t authorized to speak on the subject.  India will search the Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand starting Thursday, based on a request by Malaysia,  the official said.
Satellite images
Planes and ships from a dozen countries scouring land and sea on both sides of Peninsular Malaysia have yielded few answers on what caused Flight MH370 to disappear. Vietnam sent a plane to verify Chinese satellite images that appeared to show three floating objects, only to find nothing there.
The images were the newest that investigators were chasing, including an unexplained radar blip detected in the area of the Malacca Strait, about 2.15am. (local time) on 8 March, or 45 minutes after contact was lost with the jet flying to Beijing through the Gulf of Thailand.
Transponder signals
 The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is supporting the Department of Defence to find the missing aircraft,  said spokesman Donald Kerr in an e-mailed statement. DoD is following up on all leads on the potential path of the aircraft, and is assisting the US pacific command in their wide area search for debris fields.
Planemaker Boeing said it already has investigators on site to assist the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).  These teams would probably include 777 structures experts who can quickly identify crucial aircraft components,  said John Purvis, a retired accident investigator who headed Boeing s investigations unit for much of the 1980s and 1990s.
Miles Kotay, a Boeing spokesman, wouldn t say whether the world s largest planemaker is reviewing the satellite imagery to determine whether the pieces came from the Malaysian Air jet.  While we stand ready to assist investigators as needed, we do not comment on specifics,  Kotay said in an e-mail.
All energies
Flight MH370 s route took it over the Gulf of Thailand, where the plane was approaching Vietnamese airspace when controllers lost contact. Signals from the jet s transponder, a beacon that helps increase the plane s visibility on radar screens, also ended then.
The absence of wreckage has kept alive various theories about the plane s disappearance, from an accident to hijacking to sabotage.
While the Gulf of Thailand initially took primacy in the hunt because of Flight MH370 s last known position, Malaysia expanded the search this week to the Malacca Strait. On Wednesday, Malaysia sought help from US investigators in interpreting an unexplained radar blip detected over the strait, far from the route.
 We are devoting all our energies to the task at hand,  Hishammuddin said.  And I want to be very clear: our focus has been on finding the aircraft. We have not done anything that could jeopardize the search effort.  Bloomberg

US says  new information  may lead to expanded jet search
White House spokesman says US  consulting with international partners about  assets to deploy
Thu, Mar 13, 2014, 06:51
Updated: Thu, Mar 13, 2014, 23:01
   
 
 
A new search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean as authorities try to determine what happened to a missing Malaysian airliner, the White House said tonight.
 It s my understanding that based on some new information that s not necessarily conclusive - but new information - an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean,  White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
 And we are consulting with international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy. 
Mr Carney did not specify the nature of the  new information. 
Mr Carney sidestepped a question as to whether the United States has confidence in the investigation being conducted by the Malaysian government.
 I just don t have an evaluation to make,  he said.  What I can tell you is that we re working with the Malaysian government to try to find the plane; find out what happened to it for the sake of the families and, obviously, for the sake of knowing what caused the plane to disappear. 
The United States has been helping in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, including the deployment of US Navy vessels. It also has sent  transportation safety board and federal aviation administration officials there.
 There are a number of possible scenarios that are being investigated as to what happened to the flight. And we are not in a position at this time to make conclusions about what happened, unfortunately. But we re actively participating in the search,  Mr Carney told a regular news briefing.
 We re looking at information, pursuing possible leads, working within the investigation being led by the Malaysian government. 
US defence officials told Reuters the guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd was en route to Strait of Malacca, west of the Malaysian peninsula, to continue the search for the missing jetliner, answering a request from the Malaysian government. The officials said they were unaware of any new evidence indicating where the plane might have crashed.

The Kidd had been searching the areas south of the Gulf of Thailand , along with the destroyer USS Pinckney. A US defence official noted that a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft had already searched the Strait of Malacca.
Earlier today, Malaysian authorities  expanded their search for the missing Boeing 777 jet into the Andaman Sea and beyond after acknowledging it could have flown for several more hours after its last contact with the ground.
That scenario would make finding the plane a vastly more difficult task, and raises the possibility that searchers are currently looking in the wrong place for the aircraft and its 229 passengers and crew.
In the latest in a series of false leads, planes were sent to search an area where Chinese satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects off the southern tip of Vietnam.
 There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,  said acting Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein.
Compounding the frustration, he later said the Chinese Embassy had notified the government that the images were released by mistake and did not show any debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.
The plane was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early on Saturday when it lost contact with ground controllers and civilian radar.
An international search effort is sweeping the South China Sea and also the Strait of Malacca because of unconfirmed military radar sightings that might indicate the plane changed course and headed west after its last contact.
The Wall Street Journal newspaper quoted US investigators as saying they suspected the plane remained in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing data from the plane s engines that are automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance programme.
Mr Hishammuddin said the government had contacted Boeing and Rolls-Royce, the engine manufacturer, and both said the last data was received at 1.07am   around 23 minutes before the plane lost contact.
But asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Mr Hishammuddin said:  Of course, we can t rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search. 
He said the search had been widened into the Andaman Sea, and Malaysia is asking for radar data from neighbouring countries. India plans to deploy air and sea assets in the southern section of the sea to join the search.
Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the disappearance of the plane.
Experts say a massive failure knocking out its electrical systems, while unlikely, could explain why its transponders, which identify it to civilian radar systems and other planes nearby, were not working.
Another possibility is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.
The jet had enough fuel to reach deep into the Indian Ocean.
Dozens of ships and aircraft from 12 nations have been searching the Gulf of Thailand and the strait, but no confirmed trace has been found.
The search area is about the size of Portugal.
Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean then some debris should be floating on the surface, even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.
Malaysia s air force chief said yesterday that an unidentified object appeared on military radar records about 322km north-west of Penang, Malaysia, and experts are analysing the data in an attempt to determine whether the blip is the missing plane.

'Increasing hope' in search for missing plane
KUALA LUMPUR/WASHINGTON - Satellites picked up faint electronic pulses from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 after it went missing on Saturday, but the signals gave no information about where the stray jet was heading and little else about its fate, two sources close to the investigation said on Thursday.
But the "pings" indicated its maintenance troubleshooting systems were switched on and ready to communicate with satellites, showing the aircraft, with 239 people on board, was at least capable of communicating after losing touch with air traffic controllers.
The system transmits such pings about once an hour, according to the sources, who said five or six were heard. However, the pings alone are not proof that the plane was in the air or on the ground, the sources said.
An international search for the 777, which left Kuala Lumpur early Saturday bound for Beijing, involves at least a dozen countries. Ships and aircraft are now combing a vast area that has been widened to cover the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman Sea and on both sides of the Malay Peninsula.
The United States, which has sent ships and planes, said the search area may soon expand into the Indian Ocean, consistent with the theory that the plane may have detoured to the west about an hour after take-off from the Malaysian capital.
"It's my understanding that based on some new information that's not necessarily conclusive - but new information - an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters in Washington.
India's defence ministry has already ordered the deployment of ships, aircraft and helicopters from the remote Andaman and Nicobar Islands, 1,190 km (740 miles) east of Chennai, at the juncture of the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea.
The Indian armed forces will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide how to coordinate their search efforts with other countries that are participating, a senior command officer said.
An Indian P8I Poseidon surveillance plane was sent to the Andaman islands on Thursday, ready to join the search once cleared, the head of India's Andaman and Nicobar air force command, Air Marshal P.K Roy, said on Thursday.
The U.S. Navy was sending an advanced P-8A Poseidon to help search the Strait of Malacca, separating the Malay Peninsula from the Indonesian Island of Sumatra. It had already deployed a Navy P-3 Orion aircraft to those waters.
U.S. defense officials later told Reuters that the U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer, USS Kidd, was en route to Strait of Malacca, answering a request from the Malaysian government. The Kidd had been searching the areas south of the Gulf of Thailand, along with the destroyer USS Pinckney.
LITTLE FRESH LIGHT
The new information about signals heard by satellites shed little light on the mystery of what happened to the plane, whether it was a technical failure, a hijacking or another kind of incident on board.
While the troubleshooting systems were functioning, no data links were opened, the sources said, because the companies involved had not subscribed to that level of service from the satellite operator, the sources said.
Boeing Co, which made the missing 777 airliner, and Rolls-Royce, which supplied its Trent engines, declined to comment.
Earlier Malaysian officials denied reports that the aircraft had continued to send technical data and said there was no evidence that it flew for hours after losing contact with air traffic controllers early Saturday.
The Wall Street Journal had reported that U.S. aviation investigators and national security officials believed the Boeing 777 flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from its engines as part of a standard monitoring program.
Malaysian authorities have said the last civilian contact occurred as the Boeing 777-200ER flew north into the Gulf of Thailand. They said military radar sightings indicated the plane may have turned sharply to the west and crossed the Malay Peninsula toward the Andaman Sea.
It is one of the most baffling mysteries in the history of modern aviation - there has been no trace of the plane since nor any sign of wreckage despite a search by the navies and military aircraft of over a dozen countries across Southeast Asia.
"It's extraordinary that with all the (satellite and telecommunication) technology that we've got that an aircraft can disappear like this," Tony Tyler, the head of the International Air Transport Association that links over 90 percent of the world's airlines, told reporters in London.
WRONG IMAGES
On the sixth day of the search, planes scanned an area of sea where Chinese satellite images had shown what could be debris but found no sign of the airliner.
Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference the images were provided accidentally, saying the Chinese government neither authorised nor endorsed putting them on a website. "The image is not confirmed to be connected to the plane," he said.
It was the latest in a series of contradictory reports, adding to the confusion and agony of the relatives of the passengers, about two-thirds of whom were Chinese.
As frustration mounted over the failure to find any trace of the plane, China heaped pressure on Malaysia to improve coordination in the search.
Premier Li Keqiang, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, demanded that the "relevant party" step up coordination while China's civil aviation chief said he wanted a "smoother" flow of information from Malaysia, which has come under heavy criticism for its handling of the disaster.
Indonesia and Thailand have said their militaries detected no sign of any unusual aircraft in their airspace.
Malaysian police have said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure.
Two of the passengers on board were discovered by investigators to have false passports, but they were apparently seeking to emigrate illegally to the West.
The Boeing 777 has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft in service. Its only previous fatal crash came on July 6 last year when Asiana Airlines Flight 214 struck a seawall with its undercarriage on landing in San Francisco, killing three people.

The Malaysian air force, with help from about a dozen other nations, continues to search the seas on both sides of the Malay Peninsula for any sign of Flight 370.
/ Xinhua/Landov
Originally published on March 13, 2014 7:49 pm
This post is being updated.
Just a few hours after a stunning report from The Wall Street Journal   headlined " U.S. Investigators Suspect Missing Airplane Flew On For Hours "   the Malaysian officials in charge of the investigation say that story's central premise isn't true.
The last data received from devices installed in the Rolls-Royce engines of the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 that disappeared Saturday were transmitted at 1:07 a.m. local time, Malaysia's acting defense minister told reporters Thursday . That would be a little more than 30 minutes after Beijing-bound Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur. The minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, appeared at a news conference with the airline's CEO.
If the Malaysian official's account is correct, then the underpinnings of the Journal's story are knocked away. The newspaper reported early Thursday that:
"U.S. investigators suspect that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 stayed in the air for about four hours past the time it reached its last confirmed location, according to two people familiar with the details, raising the possibility that the plane could have flown on for hundreds of additional miles under conditions that remain murky.
"Aviation investigators and national security officials believe the plane flew for a total of five hours, based on data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground from the Boeing Co. 777's engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring program."
Update at 4:25 p.m. ET. The Journal eventually ran a correction saying the data did not come from the engines; instead U.S. investigators believe the plane kept flying past its last known contact based "on an analysis of signals sent through the plane's satellite-communication link designed to automatically transmit the status of onboard systems."
The Journal, though, isn't the only news outlet reporting Thursday about evidence that the plane may have been in the air for hours more than first thought. Bloomberg News writes that :
"Aviation specialists investigating last week's loss of Flight 370 say evidence gathered so far suggests the plane traveled west over Malaysia, possibly continuing for hours, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the probe is active. ...
"Radar signals sent from the ground continued to reflect back from the plane after its transponder went dead as the aircraft headed north from Malaysia toward Vietnam, said the people, who weren't permitted to speak publicly about the probe. After the transponder shut off, making it harder to follow on radar, the plane turned left toward the west instead of continuing on its path." (Update at 10:45 a.m. ET.)
Later Thursday, ABC News' Martha Raddatz weighed in to report that "U.S. officials have an 'indication' the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner may have crashed in the Indian Ocean and is moving the USS Kidd to the area to begin searching. It will take another 24 hours to move the ship into position, a senior Pentagon official told ABC News."
CNN, though, was saying that correspondent Richard Quest had been told by "a senior aviation source ... that there was no technical data suggesting the airplane continued flying for four hours." (Update about ABC News and CNN reports added at 12:45 p.m. ET.)
As we've written , the now six-day-old search for Flight 370 and any sign of the 239 people who were aboard has been marked by confusion and conflicting claims from Malaysian officials. The country's air force chief, for example, was quoted as saying radar had tracked the plane flying at least 200 miles west of its intended course, then later denied he had said that, then conceded the air force did indeed see radar blips that might have been the jet headed west.
Rolls-Royce is declining to comment on either the Journal's report or the Malaysian official's response, The Guardian writes . (Update at 9:50 a.m. ET.)
Meanwhile, Hussein also told reporters Thursday that Chinese satellite images showing some large objects floating in the South China Sea "did not show any debris" from the missing flight, the BBC reports . The release of those photos late Wednesday prompted speculation that the plane might finally have been found.
So, the search continues on both the eastern side of the Malay Peninsula, in the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam, and on the western side in the Malacca Strait, where the plane might have flown if it did indeed turn west for some reason.
The Journal said in its report that "as part of its maintenance agreements, Malaysia Airlines transmits its engine data live to Rolls Royce for analysis. The system compiles data from inside the 777's two Trent 800 engines and transmits snapshots of performance, as well as the altitude and speed of the jet. Those snippets are compiled and transmitted in 30-minute increments, said one person familiar with the system."
Also at Thursday's news conference, Malaysian police said reports that the homes of the jet's pilots had been searched were incorrect.
One other development: The airline announced that "as a mark of respect to the passengers and crew of [Flight] 370," it is retiring that flight number and that of Flight 371, the return trip from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Starting Friday, the Kuala Lumpur to Beijing flight's number will be 318. The Beijing to Kuala Lumpur flight will be No. 319.

INTERACTIVE: Malaysia Airlines plane carrying 239 disappears
]
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia   Malaysian authorities expanded their search for the missing jetliner westward toward India on Thursday, saying it may have flown for several hours after its last contact with the ground.
That scenario would make finding the Boeing 777 a vastly more difficult task, and raises the possibility that searchers have been looking in the wrong place for the plane and its 239 passengers and crew since it disappeared early Saturday en route to Beijing.
In the latest in a series of false leads in the hunt, search planes were sent Thursday to search an area off the southern tip of Vietnam where Chinese satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects.

Answer to Malaysian plane s mystery eluding modern sleuths

NEW YORK   There aren t supposed to be any mysteries in the Digital Age.
The answers to most questions, it seems, can be found using Google or Twitter. So maybe that s why the world is captivated by the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 and why it has created a legion of armchair sleuths, spouting theories in some cases so strange they belong in science-fiction films.
Casual conversations in supermarket aisles, barbershop chairs and office-building cafeterias have centered on the mystery and how much we don t know. With the search for the missing Boeing 777-200 entering its seventh day, the intrigue   and hypotheses   continue to grow.
 We re fascinated by it. We don t know what happened, and we hope for a miracle,  says John DiScala, who runs the travel advice site JohnnyJet.com.  People want an answer, and the suspense is killing them. 
The pros are just as perplexed. On TV and in online forums, aviation experts are more measured and analytical than the amateurs but in the end can t say with any certainty what happened.
With no distress call, no sign of wreckage and very few answers, the disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines plane is turning into one of the biggest aviation mysteries since Amelia Earhart vanished over the Pacific Ocean in 1937.
 Anybody who travels is intrigued with this story. How can a plane disappear? We ve got satellites beaming down on everybody,  says Andrea Richard, a French-American in Paris who travels widely.
Theories abound. Some are serious: There was a catastrophic failure in the airframe or engines or there might have been a pilot error. Other ideas are the kinds to be found in science-fiction movies: a new Bermuda Triangle or an alien abduction.
Terrorism isn t suspected but hasn t been ruled out, either. But some people have come up with elaborate plots where the plane is hijacked and lands on a remote island, undetected by radar.
Others have sat in their homes or offices scouring new commercial satellite images of the ocean, looking for any debris from the plane.
False leads and conflicting information have only added to the mystery, the speculation and the frustration. It s still unclear how far the plane may have flown after losing contact with civilian radar   and in which direction. On Thursday, planes were sent to search an area off the southern tip of Vietnam where Chinese satellite images released by the Chinese government reportedly showed floating objects believed to be part of the plane. Nothing turned up.
Even if the plane is found soon, the speculation likely won t fade. It can take months or years after a crash to learn definitively what happened.
That s an anomaly in an age of instant answers. If something isn t known, we just Google it. If we are lost, we use the GPS on our smartphones to find our location. And if our flight is delayed, the airline sends us a text message.
In this situation   to everybody s frustration   we still don t have a conclusion.
TV shows like Lost and movies like Castaway, where people survive a plane crash only to have the rest of the world give up on them, just feed the curiosity.
 This feeds into everyone s fear of flying. It s one thing for people to have a fear of dying in a plane crash. It s another one to die in a plane crash and never be found,  says Phil Derner, founder of the aviation enthusiast website NYC Aviation.
Those within the aviation industry are enthralled with the mystery, too, but from a much more methodical, scientific viewpoint.
 There s a lot of head scratching going on,  says Daniel Rose, a partner with the aviation accident law firm Kreindler & Kreindler, which is representing the survivors and victims  families of July s Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco.  It becomes like a murder mystery almost, these clues that you re getting and trying to piece it together in a way that makes technical and logical sense. 
Jason Rabinowitz, a self-proclaimed aviation geek whose hobby includes snapping photographs of airplanes taking off and landing, said those in the industry are bringing up previous incidents and previous searches  rather than clinging to straws. 
 The aviation community is more puzzled than the general population because we know more of what would cause an accident and we still have no clue,  Rabinowitz says.  I keep going to sleep every night and hoping that I wake up with some shred of good news, but it isn t happening.

Chinese satellite images could provide clues to missing Malaysian airliner
Today's Top Stories

Euronews
Could newly released satellite images from China provide the clue searchers have been waiting for in the hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet?
Photos have appeared on a Chinese government website showing what could be floating debris from the plane. The images were taken one day after the aircraft vanished.
The unconfirmed objects were found in the vicinity of where the plane with 239 people board disappeared on its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
China is losing patience with Malaysian efforts to coordinate the search and has demanded more accurate information about the missing plane.
It is not clear why the images took so long to be released but China, whose nationals made up the majority of those on board, has intensified its satellite checking.
Vietnam s military has said the area where the photos were taken will be searched once more.

Timeline - The search for missing Malaysian jet
SINGAPORE Here is a timeline of events in the disappearance of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner which vanished from radar screens on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early on Saturday:
SATURDAY, MARCH 8
- Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 Flight departs at 12:41 a.m. (1641 GMT Friday), and is due to land in Beijing at 6:30 a.m. (2230 GMT) the same day. On board the Boeing 777-200ER are 227 passengers and 12 crew.
- Airline loses contact with plane between 1-2 hours after takeoff. No distress signal and weather is clear at the time.
- Missing plane last has contact with air traffic controllers 120 nautical miles off the east coast of the Malaysian town of Kota Bharu.
- Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam says plane failed to check in as scheduled at 1721 GMT while flying over sea between Malaysia and Ho Chi Minh City.
- Flight tracking website flightaware.com shows plane flew northeast over Malaysia after takeoff and climbed to altitude of 35,000 feet. The flight vanished from website's tracking records a minute later while still climbing.
- Malaysia search ships see no sign of wreckage in area where flights last made contact. Vietnam says giant oil slick and column of smoke seen in its waters.
- Two men from Austria and Italy, listed among the passengers on a missing Malaysia Airlines flight, are not in fact on board. They say their passports were stolen.
SUNDAY, MARCH 9
- Malaysia Airlines says fears worst and is working with U.S. company that specialises in disaster recovery.
- Radar indicates flight may have turned back from its scheduled route to Beijing before disappearing.
- Interpol says at least two passports recorded as lost or stolen in its database were used by passengers, and it is "examining additional suspect passports".
- Investigators narrow focus of inquiries on possibility plane disintegrated in mid-flight, a source who is involved in the investigations in Malaysia tells Reuters.
MONDAY, MARCH 10
- The United States review of American spy satellite imagery shows no signs of mid-air explosion.
- As dozens of ships and aircraft from seven countries scour the seas around Malaysia and south of Vietnam, questions mounted over whether a bomb or hijacking could have brought down the Boeing airliner.
- Hijacking could not be ruled out, said the head of Malaysia's Civil Aviation Authority, Azharuddin Abdul Rahmanthe, adding the missing jet was an "unprecedented aviation mystery".
- The disappearance of the Malaysian airliner could dent the national carrier's plan to return to profit by end-2014, equity analysts said. Shares in MAS hot a record low on Monday.
TUESDAY, MARCH 11
- Interpol Secretary General Ronald Noble names the two men who boarded jet with stolen passports as Iranians, aged 18 and 29, who had entered Malaysia using their real passports. "The more information we get, the more we are inclined to conclude it is not a terrorist incident," Noble said.
- Malaysian police chief said the younger man appeared to be an illegal immigrant. His mother was waiting for him in Frankfurt and had been in contact with authorities, he said.
- Malaysian police say they are investigating whether any passengers or crew on the plane had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure.
- Malaysia's military believes missing jet turned and flew hundreds of kilometres to the west after it last made contact with civilian air traffic control off the country's east coast, a senior officer told Reuters. The jet made it into the Strait of Malacca, one of the world's busiest shipping channels, along Malaysia's west coast, said the officer.
- A Colorado-based company has put "crowdsourcing" to work in search for a missing jet, enlisting Internet users to comb through satellite images of more than 1,200 square miles (3,200 square km) of open seas for any signs of wreckage.
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 12
- The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet expands to an area stretching from China to India, as authorities struggle to answer what had happened to the aircraft that vanished almost five days ago with 239 people on board.
(The story corrects time of departure on Saturday to 12:41 a.m. (1641 GMT Friday)).

Possible signals from lost Malaysian plane's black boxes heard

PERTH, Australia (AP) -- Underwater sounds detected by a ship searching the southern Indian Ocean for the missing Malaysia Airlines jet are consistent with the pings from aircraft black boxes, an Australian official said Monday, dubbing it "a most promising lead" in the monthlong hunt for the vanished plane.
Angus Houston, the head of a joint agency coordinating the search, warned that it could take days to confirm whether the signals picked up by the Australian navy ship Ocean Shield are indeed from the black boxes that belonged to Flight 370, but called the discovery very encouraging.
"Clearly this is a most promising lead, and probably in the search so far, it's probably the best information that we have had," Houston said at a news conference. "We've got a visual indication on a screen and we've also got an audible signal - and the audible signal sounds to me just like an emergency locator beacon."
After a monthlong search for answers filled with dead ends, Monday's news brought fresh hope given that the two black boxes, which contain flight data and cockpit voice recordings, are the key to unraveling exactly what happened to Flight 370 and why.
Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammudin Hussein told reporters that in light of the new information, "We are cautiously hopeful that there will be a positive development in the next few days, if not hours."
There was little time left to locate the devices, which have beacons that emit "pings" so they can be more easily found. The beacons' batteries last only about a month - and Tuesday marks exactly one month since the plane disappeared during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing with 239 people on board.
The Australian navy's Ocean Shield, which is carrying high-tech sound detectors from the U.S. Navy, picked up two separate signals late Saturday night and early Sunday morning within a remote patch of the Indian Ocean far off the west Australian coast that search crews have been crisscrossing for weeks. The first signal lasted two hours and 20 minutes before it was lost. The ship then turned around and picked up a signal again - this time recording two distinct "pinger returns" that lasted 13 minutes, Houston said.
"Significantly, this would be consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder," Houston said.
Still, Houston cautioned that it was too early to say the transmissions were coming from the missing jet.
"I would want more confirmation before we say this is it," he said. "Without wreckage, we can't say it's definitely here. We've got to go down and have a look."
The airliner's black boxes normally emit a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz, and the signals picked up by the Ocean Shield were both 33.3 kilohertz, said U.S. Navy Capt. Mark Matthews. But officials contacted the device's manufacturer and were told the frequency of black boxes can drift near the end of their shelf lives.
The Ocean Shield was slowly canvassing a small area trying to find the signal again, though that could take another day, Matthews said.
The ping locator is designed to detect signals at a range of 1.8 kilometers (1.12 miles), meaning it would need to be almost on top of the black boxes to detect them if they were on the ocean floor, which is about 4,500 meters (14,800 feet) deep.
"It's like playing hot and cold when you're searching for something and someone's telling you you're getting warmer and warmer and warmer," he said. "When you're right on top of it you get a good return."
If they pick up the signal again, the crew will launch an underwater vehicle to investigate, Matthews said. The Bluefin-21 autonomous sub can create a sonar map of the area to chart where the debris may lie on the sea floor. If it maps out a debris field, the crew will replace the sonar system with a camera unit to photograph any wreckage.
But that may prove tricky, given that the sub can only dive to about 4,500 meters (14,800 feet) - the approximate depth of the water. That means the vehicle will be operating to the limits of its capability.
Given the difficulties involved, officials warned the mystery of Flight 370 would still take time to resolve.
"It could take some days before the information is available to establish whether these detections can be confirmed as being from MH370," Houston said. "In very deep oceanic water, nothing happens fast."
Geoff Dell, discipline leader of accident investigation at Central Queensland University in Australia, said it would be "coincidental in the extreme" for the sounds to have come from anything other than an aircraft's black box.
"If they have a got a legitimate signal, and it's not from one of the other vessels or something, you would have to say they are within a bull's roar," he said. "There's still a chance that it's a spurious signal that's coming from somewhere else and they are chasing a ghost, but it certainly is encouraging that they've found something to suggest they are in the right spot."
Meanwhile, the British ship HMS Echo, was using sophisticated sound-locating equipment to try to determine whether two separate sounds heard by a Chinese ship about 555 kilometers (345 miles) away from the Ocean Shield were related to the plane. The patrol vessel Haixun 01 detected a brief "pulse signal" on Friday and a second signal on Saturday.
The crew of the Chinese ship reportedly picked up the signals using a sonar device called a hydrophone dangled over the side of a small boat - something experts said was technically possible but extremely unlikely. The equipment aboard the British and Australian ships is dragged slowly behind each vessel over long distances and is considered far more sophisticated.
The search effort was also continuing on the ocean surface Monday. Twelve planes and 14 ships were searching three designated zones, one of which overlaps with the Ocean Shield's underwater search. All of the previous surface searches have found only fishing equipment or other sea trash floating in the water, but have found no debris related to the Malaysian plane.

CORRECTED-Malaysia failing credibility test as flight confusion deepens
(Reverts to author's correct spelling of Hishammuddin)
By Stuart Grudgings
KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 One of the world's most perplexing aviation mysteries is casting a harsh spotlight on Malaysia's government, as a leadership unused to heavy scrutiny comes under intense international criticism for a litany of confusing messages and a perceived lack of transparency.
Five days after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared from civilian radar screens, a huge international search operation has failed to turn up a trace of the Boeing  jetliner that was carrying 239 passengers and crew.
Frustration over the fruitless search has increasingly been directed at Malaysian officials after a series of fumbling news conferences, incorrect details given by the national airline, and a long delay in divulging details of the military's tracking of what could have been the plane hundreds of miles off course.
The missteps have ranged from conflicting information about the last time of contact with the jet to the sharing of photos of two passengers in which they had the same pair of legs.
"The Malaysians deserve to be criticized - their handling of this has been atrocious," said Ernest Bower, a Southeast Asia specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
Government officials say they are coping as best they can with an exceptional, highly complex crisis.
Confusion, false leads, and misinformation are common in the initial hours of air disasters in any country.
But China, whose citizens made up around two-thirds of the passengers on board the flight, has barely hidden its impatience with Malaysia, urging it several times to step up the search and investigation efforts.
The head of the Civil Aviation Authority of China, Li Jiaxiang, told reporters on Thursday that the message had been repeated to Malaysia's special envoy in the Chinese capital.
"Yesterday Malaysia's special envoy arrived in Beijing, and the CAAC asked of him that Malaysia step up search efforts and increase their scope, and that we hope that Malaysia's information release and communication can be smoother," he said.
FAMILIES ANGRY
Some families of the up to 154 missing Chinese have voiced fury at what they said was the slow release of information. Verbal abuse and water bottles were hurled at representatives of the government-owned airline in Beijing.
"The core of Malaysia's information hasn't been consistent from start to finish," said China's widely read and influential Global Times tabloid, published by the Communist Party's official People's Daily.
"It certainly hits at the confidence that the rest of the world has in Malaysia's ability to be the nucleus of the rescue mission," the paper added.
Other governments have praised the Malaysian effort, but some officials have complained of a lack of communication and information sharing that has slowed initial fact-finding.
U.S. officials said Malaysia's failure to disclose the military's radar tracking data until days after the plane's disappearance meant important evidence may have disappeared.
"The lack of communication about what is going on is catastrophic," said one Western regulatory source, asking not to be identified. "We are in the fourth dimension here."
COMMUNICATION DEFICIT
Malaysia's government, one of the longest-serving in the democratic world with the same coalition in power for the 57 years since independence, has struggled to cope with the harsh glare of international scrutiny.
The ruling United Malays National Organisation has long been criticised, including by some of its own members, for cronyism, an authoritarian streak and breeding a political culture in which loyalty is prized over talent.
Majority ethnic Malays have benefited from a system of economic and social privileges that has steadily alienated ethnic Chinese and Indians, who make up large minorities in the nation of 29 million people.
Just a day before the plane vanished, a court convicted opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim of sodomy and sentenced him to five years in prison, overturning his acquittal two years ago in a ruling that supporters and international human rights groups say was politically influenced.
Ministries often meet requests for information or interviews with silence.
"There was a lot of confusion on the first and second days of this incident," a senior Malaysian defence official with knowledge of the operations told Reuters.
"A lot of permissioning, especially when you start sharing information with other ministries in government. I admit there is a lot of bureaucracy and we were slow."
Malaysia's response has been overseen personally by Prime Minister Najib Razak, who put his cousin - the defence and acting transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein - in charge of day-to-day operations and interaction with the media.
"This is unique what we are going through," Hishammuddin told reporters at a Wednesday news conference, batting away their complaints over a lack of transparency. "Coordinating with so many countries is not easy."
The frequency of news conferences given to hundreds of reporters now massed at a hotel next to the international airport has dwindled sharply since the first day. The delayed briefing on Wednesday evening was the first to give details on the search operation in two days.
CONFUSION FROM START
The confusion began hours after the flight vanished from air traffic control radar early on Saturday morning. Malaysian Airlines initially said the plane lost contact at 2:40 a.m., two hours after its departure. Hours later, it corrected the time to 1:30 a.m.
As details emerged that some passengers had boarded the flight using stolen passports, Malaysia's home minister was quoted by state news agency Bernama as saying that two men travelling on Italian and Austrian documents had "Asian faces".
That was denied by Hishammuddin, and the muddle deepened when Malaysia's aviation chief attempted a confusing analogy with the black Italian footballer Mario Balotelli.
The men turned out to be Iranians who were not suspected of being connected with the disappearance of the plane.
On Tuesday, police displayed pictures of the two in which their legs appeared exactly the same, sparking speculation of a cover-up. Police later said this was a photocopying error, according to local media.
National police chief Khalid Abu Bakar flatly denied a statement by the aviation chief that there were five passengers who checked-in for the flight and did not board. Malaysia Airlines later clarified there had been four passengers who did not show up at the airport for the flight.
Perhaps the greatest confusion was generated by the Malaysian military's revelation on Sunday that the plane may have turned back from its scheduled path off Malaysia's east coast before disappearing.
Officials did not give more details on the suspected "turnback" until Wednesday, leaving a gap that was filled by speculation the government was hiding something and doubts over whether the search was being conducted in the right place.
On Wednesday, officials confirmed they tracked an unidentified aircraft into the Malacca Strait, hundreds of miles and off the opposite coast from where the jet went missing.
Bowers, the Southeast Asia specialist, said Malaysia's apparent mishandling of the situation could have long-term strategic consequences in a region where China's economic and military might is growing rapidly.
"They have no maritime domain awareness and it doesn't look like they have a strong command and control structure and they're not well coordinated with friends. Sadly, that's what the MH370 situation demonstrates," he said of Malaysia.
"It's not good and it fits in with the narrative I believe is forming in Beijing that China should and needs to take control."

Officials deny that missing Malaysian plane flew for four hours after losing contact
Today's Top Stories

There is no breakthrough in the search for flight MH370, but strong denials of dramatic media reports.
Officials have rejected a Wall Street Journal report that the plane may have flown for four hours after losing contact with air traffic controllers.
The paper said this was based on data automatically sent to the ground from the Boeing engines. But Malaysian officials deny that.
Transport Minister Hishammudin Hussein told a news conference:  Rolls Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS (the airline) and the investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised.
 Whenever there are new details they must be corroborated. Since today s media reports MAS has asked Rolls Royce and Boeing specifically about the data; as far as Rolls Royce and Boeing are concerned, those reports are inaccurate. 
Officials also said reports of debris showing up on Chinese satellite images have come to nothing.
Amid mounting criticism, officials have also again strongly defended their search efforts, in what is being described as the most baffling mystery in modern aviation history.
It is an agonising wait for relatives of the 239 people on board.
Efforts to locate the plane are being hampered by conflicting reports about its possible flight path. The searchers are now combing an area of 100,000 square kilometres.

Four days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished somewhere between Kuala Lumpur and Beijing, its fate remains unknown, adding a cruel uncertainty to the grief of the families and friends of the 239 people onboard.
Planes, ships and satellites from 10 countries   the United States for instance, has dispatched two destroyers, an oiler and a patrol plane   are conducting an extensive and expensive search. Yet much of the excruciating mystery surrounding the plane s loss could have been averted if the recommendations ensuing from an earlier crash had been followed.
On June 1, 2009, an Air France Airbus A330 flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris disappeared off the coast of Brazil. It took five days to find the site of the crash   and two more years to retrieve the plane s data recorders from waters some 3,900 meters (12,000 feet) deep.
Three years after that tragedy, France s air-accident investigation bureau issued its final report, with more than 40 recommendations. Many relate to the specific circumstances that led to the plane s crash, and it s not yet clear whether they would be relevant to the Malaysia Airlines flight.
There is at least one area, however, where their applicability is glaringly apparent: the recording and transmission of flight data. In particular, the bureau recommended that the European Aviation Safety Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organization  make mandatory as quickly as possible, for aeroplanes making public transport flights with passengers over maritime or remote areas, triggering of data transmission to facilitate localisation as soon as an emergency situation is detected on board. 
Such systems exist, but airlines have balked at the expense of installation (which one manufacturer put at less than $100,000 per aircraft) and the cost of transmitting and storing huge amounts of data. Yet the bureau was not recommending continuous transmission, but rather  triggered transmission    when, say, there are unusual changes in a plane s altitude (a steep bank, for instance), speed or proximity to the ground. A working group of more than 150 people gathered from manufacturers to regulators concluded that such a system could detect anomalies as they happen, and that  nuisance transmissions    that is, false alarms   could be all but eliminated. The stream of data would not only make travel safer, but also help companies save money on maintenance and fuel efficiency. Cheaper but still effective would be off-the-shelf technology that continually transmits, in short bursts, just a plane s position and velocity when it s over water and out of radar range.
The International Civil Aviation Organization, an unwieldy group that moves more like an aircraft carrier than a jet, has so far not made triggered transmission part of its standards and recommended practices. Nor does it seem to have speedily adopted some of the report s many other sensible recommendations   on coordinating and training for search and rescue efforts, for instance, or requiring all underwater locating beacons to send transmissions for 90 days.
Which leaves a question that will linger after Flight 370 is found: How many more planes will have to vanish before that happens?

Six days after flight MH370 disappeared, the Indian Ocean has become the latest area that authorities will scour in an attempt to find the aircraft and her 239 passengers and crew that disappeared without a trace.
"It's my understanding that based on some new information that's not necessarily conclusive - but new information - an additional search area may be opened in the Indian Ocean," White House spokesman Jay Carney said yesterday, without disclosing the nature of the "information".
"We are consulting with international partners about the appropriate assets to deploy," he told a press conference.
He continued: "There are a number of possible scenarios that are being investigated as to what happened to the flight. And we are not in a position at this time to make conclusions about what happened, unfortunately. But we're actively participating in the search."
"We're looking at information, pursuing possible leads, working within the investigation being led by the Malaysian government," Carney added.
His announcement follows a press conference in Kuala Lumpur where Malaysia s Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said a search involving 12 nations and more than 80 aircraft and planes had still failed to uncover any trace of the Boeing 777.
 There is no real precedent for a situation like this. The plane vanished,  he said.
Mr Hussein strongly denied reports that data from the plane s engines showed that it had flown for a further four hours from its last confirmed location and may have been intentionally diverted.
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported that investigators in the US were  examining whether the missing plane was  intentionally diverted  from its planned route.

The report said US counter-terrorism officials were examining the possibility that the plane s course had been changed  with the intention of using it later for another purpose  and that its transponders were intentionally turned off to avoid radar detection.
It said said data downloaded automatically from the plane s engines, suggested the plane flew for a total of five hours. Its final confirmed location was at 1.31am last Saturday, about 40 minutes after it took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport. At that point it was heading north-east across the mouth of the Gulf of Thailand on what should have been a six-hour flight to Beijing.
If true, the information downloaded from the plane s Rolls Royce engines as part of a routine maintenance and monitoring programme, suggested the plane could have flown on for up to 2,000 more miles and reached as far as northern India or even the north-west coast of Australia. It would expand the possible search area almost limitlessly.
But during a press conference on Thursday afternoon local time, Mr Hussein rejected the reports. He said experts from both Boeing and Rolls Royce were assisting the investigation and that the last transmission received from the engines was at 1.07am on Saturday morning. It had suggested everything was normal.
 Rolls Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with Malaysia Airlines investigation teams since Sunday,  he said.  This issue has never been raised. Since today s media reports Malaysia Airlines has asked Rolls Royce and Boeing specifically about the data. As far as Rolls Royce and Boeing are concerned those reports are inaccurate. 
He added:  Whenever there any any details they must be corroborated. 
Mr Hussein also denied reports in the Malaysian media which claimed the police had raided the home of the plane s main pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, to determine whether or not he was encountering any psychological problems.

Can satellites help find missing flight MH370?
March 13, 2014                        by Linlin Ge, The Conversation

China has released several satellite images its officials say could be wreckage from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 with 239 people onboard.
If they are proved to be true it shows how remote sensing satellites can play an important role in locating the wreckage of a crashed plane. It can be done within a couple of hours after the accident if multiple high-resolution satellites are used.
About satellites
Remote sensing satellites can be broadly classified into two categories   optical and radar satellites.
Optical satellites can now deliver unclassified images at a resolution of half a metre while radar satellites can provide unclassified images at one metre resolution.
Metallic structures such as plane wreckage can produce strong return on radar images, making them easily visible. Satellite imaging radar can also "see" through any cloud and can take images day and night.
According to China's satellite images   taken over the suspected crash area a day after flight MH370  went missing on Saturday   the largest object shown is about 24m by 22m. This is clearly large enough to be imaged by both optical and radar satellites.
It should be noted from the images that the object is closely surrounded by cloud. Any potential wreckage would not be spotted by optical satellite if it were covered by cloud but it would still be visible on a radar image.
That's why it makes sense to use both optical and radar satellites in any search for the location of plane wreckage.

Eye in the sky
Satellite remote sensing has many advantages over conventional air and sea search using ships and aircraft.
The satellites orbit around Earth at a height between 200km to 900km and can cover a large area, typically 100km by 100km (100,000 square kilometres   about the size of Cuba) or even 500km by 500km (250,000 square kilometres   about the size of the UK), with a single image collected in only a few seconds.
It would take an aircraft between 1.5 and 34 hours to cover the same area. A ship will take much longer.
So it is much more cost effective to use remote sensing satellites to search over large areas.
Another advantage of satellites is that once in orbit the cameras and radar sensors on board are always on standby. They can be switched on immediately, as soon as the space agencies are informed of an accident, and be pointed straight at the area around the last known coordinates of the aircraft.
This also makes them much quicker to respond to incidents such as the air crash than the air and sea search vessels.
Another advantage is that satellites can take images globally without the issue around border protection so it is much easier to use them in international search.
Any limits?
Although the remote sensing satellites have the potential for global coverage some do have difficulty in imaging the two poles. That's because they use near-polar orbits and not all of them have side-looking capability   they mostly look only down.

If an aircraft goes missing in the mountains, there is also a good chance that any wreckage may be hidden under the forest canopy. Although long wavelength radars can penetrate tree canopy, they may still have difficulty in seeing through the dense tropical forest.
In contrast, the open sea is a more favourable environment for searching a missing aircraft with satellite remote sensing, because the main features in a satellite image will be just sea water and the plane wreckage   there is less chance of confusing any wreckage with any other targets, such as trucks, trains or farm houses, as in the case of a plane crash on land.
Satellites in other disasters
Since 2008 the Geodesy and Earth Observing Systems group ( GEOS ), at the UNSW School of Civil & Environmental Engineering has responded, in near real-time, to a range of natural disasters using both optical and radar satellite remote sensing .
These events include major earthquakes in China and New Zealand, bushfire in Victoria and floods in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.
The team has repeatedly demonstrated that intelligence such as ground deformation, fire and flood extent can be extracted and delivered to relevant authorities within two hours of satellite image capture.

Satellites join search for missing plane

A fleet of Earth-monitoring satellites has joined the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.
China on Tuesday requested activation of the so-called International Charter on Space and Major Disasters, the organisation said on its website on Wednesday.
Under the agreement, 15 space agencies or national space institutes help emergency or relief efforts by passing on images from satellites flying over the location.
 Satellite imagery is now being employed to search for any evidence of the plane, both before and after it disappeared,  the website said.
 As of 12 March 2014, the search remains ongoing. 
The activation request came from the China Meteorological Administration, it said.
 They are providing high-resolution data,  said a European Space Agency (ESA) official, whose organisation is a charter member.
He was unable to say which geographical areas were being covered.
The Charter, which took effect in 2000, has been activated more than 400 times, but this is the first time it has been called in to help the search for a missing aircraft, according to records of its operations.
It has been mostly used in the aftermath of earthquakes and floods when rescue teams needed to identify badly damaged zones or roads, railways and bridges that are still passable.
It was invoked last November to aid swathes of the Philippines ravaged by Typhoon Haiyan.
Once activated, space technicians determine which satellites are available and best suited for the task of providing ground radar data or photos.
They then send a request to the satellite s operator, which programs the orbiter to take pictures as it flies a zone. The data are usually available within 24 hours and are provided for free.
US satellite firm DigitalGlobe has set up a crowd sourcing platform, inviting internet users to comb through images to search for clues of the missing aircraft.

Chinese satellite images may show missing Malaysia Airlines plane

The report Wednesday says the images from around 11 a.m. on March 9 appear to show "three suspected floating objects" of varying sizes. 
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia   China's official Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday that a government website has satellite images of suspected debris from the missing Malaysia Airlines plane off the southern tip of Vietnam.
The report Wednesday says the images from around 11 a.m. on March 9 appear to show "three suspected floating objects" of varying sizes.
The report includes coordinates of a location in the sea off the southern tip of Vietnam and east of Malaysia, which apparently was part of the original search area after the plane disappeared early Saturday. The images were posted on a national defense technology website.
The Xinhua report says the largest of the suspected pieces of debris measures about 24 meters (79 feet) by 22 meters (72 feet).
The search for the missing plane, which left Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, has encompassed 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometers) of Southeast Asia and on Wednesday expanded toward India.
Two-thirds of the passengers on the flight were Chinese, and the Chinese government has put increasing pressure on Malaysian officials to find solve the mystery of the plane's disappearance.
Also, Wednesday, it was revealed that the last message from the cockpit of the missing flight was routine. "All right, good night," was the signoff transmitted to air traffic controllers five days ago.
Then the Boeing 777 vanished as it cruised over the South China Sea toward Vietnam, and nothing has been seen or heard of the jetliner since.
Those final words were picked up by controllers and relayed Wednesday in Beijing to anguished relatives of some of the 239 people aboard Flight MH370.
The new Chinese reports of the satellite images came after several days of sometimes confusing and conflicting statements from Malaysian officials.
Earlier Wednesday, the Malaysian military officially disclosed why it was searching on both sides of country: A review of military radar records showed what might have been the plane turning back and crossing westward into the Strait of Malacca.
That would conflict with the latest images on the Chinese website.
For now, authorities said the international search effort would stay focused on the South China Sea and the strait leading toward the Andaman Sea.
Chinese impatience has grown.
"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."
"We have nothing to hide," said Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein. "There is only confusion if you want to see confusion."
Flight MH370 disappeared from civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. Saturday at an altitude of about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing problems.
The Malaysian government said it had asked India to join in the search near the Andaman Sea, suggesting the jetliner might have reached those waters after crossing into the Strait of Malacca, some 400 kilometers (250 miles) from the flight's last-known coordinates.
Malaysian officials met in Beijing with several hundred Chinese relatives of passengers to explain the search and investigation, and to relay the last transmission that Malaysian air traffic controllers received before the plane entered Vietnamese airspace, according to a participant in the meeting.
Aviation officials in Vietnam said they never heard from the plane.
Its sudden disappearance led to initial speculation of a catastrophic incident that caused it to disintegrate. Another possibility is that it continued to fly despite a failure of its electrical systems, which could have knocked out communications, including transponders that enable the plane to be identified by commercial radar.
Authorities have not ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage and terrorism, and they are waiting to find any wreckage or debris to determine what went wrong.
In June 2013, Boeing issued a safety alert to Boeing 777 operators, telling them to inspect for corrosion and cracks in the crown fuselage around a satellite antenna. The alert says one airline found a 16-inch crack in one plane, then checked other 777s and found more cracking.
"Cracks in the fuselage skin that are not found and repaired can propagate to the point where the fuselage skin structure cannot sustain limit load," Boeing said. "When the fuselage skin cannot sustain limit load, this can result in possible rapid decompression and loss of structural integrity."
Two U.S. Federal Aviation Administration technical experts and a regional representative are in Kuala Lumpur as part of an NTSB team supporting the investigation. Experts in air traffic control and radar are providing technical help, the board said.
Hishammuddin described the multinational search as unprecedented. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area to the east and west of Peninsular Malaysia.
"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he told a news conference. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families of those on board."
Confusion over whether the plane had been seen flying west prompted speculation that different arms of the government might have different opinions about its location, or even that authorities were holding back information.
Earlier in the week, Malaysia's head of civil aviation, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, was asked why the Strait of Malacca was being searched and replied, "There are things I can tell you, and things I can't," suggesting that the government wasn't being completely transparent.
If all those on board are confirmed dead, it would be the deadliest commercial air accident in 10 years.
Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian, said his family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His 45-year-old daughter-in-law, Goh Sock Lay, was the chief flight attendant. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.
"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.

Missing Malaysia Airlines plane may be 'act of piracy' and could have LANDED somewhere
Missing Malaysia Airlines plane may be 'act of piracy' and could have LANDED somewhere
THE MISSING Malaysian plane may have disappeared as "an act of piracy", with officials today admitting for the first time the jet could have been hijacked.

India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea
Sources have confirmed that sabotage is a real possibility with military-radar tracking evidence suggesting Flight MH370 could have been flown hundreds of miles off course towards the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, north-west of Malaysia.
A senior Malaysian police official said inquiries were focusing increasingly on the theory that someone who knew how to fly a plane deliberately diverted the Boeing 777, with 239 people on board, off its intended course from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
A U.S official in Washington said that investigators are examining the possibility of "human intervention" in the plane's disappearance, adding it may have been "an act of piracy."
The official, who wasn't authorised to talk to the media and spoke on condition of anonymity, also said it was possible the plane may have landed somewhere.
India has now taken to using heat sensors on flights over hundreds of uninhabited islands in the Andaman Sea as search efforts continue to expand.
Two Indian air force reconnaissance planes flew over the Andaman and Nicobar Islands after they and two naval ships and two coast guard vessels scoured the surrounding seas without finding evidence of the plane.
A spokesman declined to give details about the rest of the search operation, including the use of technologies such as the heat sensors aboard the Dornier planes.
The Andaman and Nicobar archipelago stretches south of Myanmar and contains 572 islands covering an area of 447-by-32 miles. 
Only 37 are inhabited, with the rest covered in dense forests.

As the search for the missing plane entered its seventh day, a senior Malaysian police official said: "What we can say is we are looking at sabotage, with hijack still on the cards." 
Two sources said an unidentified aircraft believed to be Flight MH370 was following a route between navigational waypoints - indicating it was being flown by someone with aviation training - when it was last plotted on military radar off Malaysia s northwest coast. 
The position suggested the plane was flying toward India's Andaman Islands, which lie between the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal.
That would mean it flew for up to five hours after the last contact and officials are now likely to have to dramatically extend the current 27,000sq nautical mile search area out into the vast Indian Ocean. 
Malaysian police have previously said they were investigating whether any passengers or crew had personal or psychological problems that might shed light on the mystery, along with the possibility of a hijacking, sabotage or mechanical failure. 
The comments by the three sources are the first clear indication that foul play is the main focus of official suspicions in the Boeing 777's disappearance. 
 Earlier reports that two passengers boarded the plane with stolen passports sparked speculation the plane could have been hijacked by terrorists, but the theory weakened after Malaysian authorities determined that one of them was an Iranian seeking asylum in Europe. 
Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar said: "We believe he is not likely to be a member of any terrorist group. 
 Speaking at a press conference this morning, the country s transport minister Hishammuddin Hussein said they were looking into the possibilty one of the pilots may have been involved. 
 He also said the plane s tracking systems could have been turned off by someone intentionally, or under duress.
 In the week that the plane has been missing, several other theories have been put forward.

 The last words heard from pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, by air traffic control were  Alright, good night' as the plane switched from Malaysian to Vietnamese airspace.
 Retired British Airways pilot Alastair Rosenschein believes Flight MH 370 has plunged into the Indian Ocean half way between Madagascar and Australia.
 Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, he claimed the Malaysian jetliner is around 5,000 miles away from where rescuers are looking in the South China Sea after flying on a course set by the pilots before the crew passed out from a drop in cabin pressure.
He said: "The initial reaction for pilots in that case would be to put on oxygen masks immediately.
 "However, had they failed to do that the next option would be to turn off the airway in order to do a rapid descent.
"Without the oxygen masks they would have passed out within a few seconds.
"That would have left the aircraft on autopilot heading in whichever direction they had turned the aircraft on the autopilot.
"I'm suggesting that they would have made that initial heading a reciprocal one back towards Kuala Lumpur airport.
 "That doesn't mean they turned the aircraft directly and exactly toward Kuala Lumpur airport it could quite happily have been a parallel track with the airway.
"With the fuel on board that would put the aircraft finally as it ran out out of fuel, with everybody unconscious on board, somewhere around the mid-Indian Ocean which is thousands of miles away from where they're looking at present.
"The worst case scenario for the location of the aircraft would be half-way between Madagascar and Australia, a very very difficult area to search and of course a huge area."
Satellite images released by Chinese authorities earlier this week appeared to show the outline of a plane's wreckage floating in between the Gulf of Thailand the South China Sea. 
But Malaysia's transport minister said the pictures do not show the wreckage of the missing aircraft and were released by mistake and a Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency surveillance plan had been dispatched to the area and had found nothing. 
Mr Hussein also dismissed a report by the Wall Street Journal that MH 370 kept flying for several hours after it lost contact, claiming teams from Boeing and Rolls Royce confirmed engine data cited in the article was inaccurate.

Malaysia denies report missing jet may have flown for hours after last contact
( Xinhua )    19:15, March 13, 2014

KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 -- Malaysian authorities on Thursday denied news reports that a Malaysian Airlines passenger jet may have continued flying for some time after last contact, saying these reports "were inaccurate."
"The last transmission from the aircraft was at 01: 07 a.m., which indiMalaysiacated everything was normal," Malaysian Acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin. "Rolls Royce and the Boeing team are here in Kuala Lumpur, and are working with us and the investigation team since Sunday, these issues have never been raised."
The official also said nothing has been found at the site where Chinese satellites spotted three floating objects in the hunt for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370.
A Malaysian surveillance plane was dispatched this morning to investigate potential debris shown on Chinese satellite images, the minister said, "we deployed our assets, but found nothing."
The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200ER with 239 aboard, disappeared suddenly early Saturday on its way to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 mystery deepens; officials don't know which way it was flying
Email
Last Updated Mar 12, 2014 2:17 PM EDT
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian authorities defended their handling of the hunt for the missing Boeing 777 on Wednesday even as they acknowledged they were unsure which direction the plane was headed when it disappeared, highlighting the massive task facing an international search mission now in its fifth day.
Authorities investigating the mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are now considering the possibility of a deliberate crash. CBS News aviatio...
The mystery over the plane's whereabouts has been confounded by confusing and occasionally conflicting statements by Malaysian officials, adding to the anguish of relatives of the 239 people on board the flight -- two thirds of them Chinese.
"There's too much information and confusion right now. It is very hard for us to decide whether a given piece of information is accurate," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters in Beijing. "We will not give it up as long as there's still a shred of hope."
Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein described the multinational search for the missing plane as an unprecedented and complicated effort and defended his country's efforts. Some 43 ships and 39 aircraft from at least eight nations were scouring an area of 35,800 square miles.
"It's not something that is easy. We are looking at so many vessels and aircraft, so many countries to coordinate, and a vast area for us to search," he said. "But we will never give up. This we owe to the families" of those on board.
Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early Saturday morning and fell off civilian radar screens at 1:30 a.m. about 35,000 feet above the Gulf of Thailand between Malaysia and southern Vietnam. It sent no distress signals or any indication it was experiencing any problems.
For an unknown reason, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's transponder, which sends out location information to radar stations, apparently stopped wor...
Malaysian authorities have since said that air defense radar picked up traces of what might have been the plane turning back and flying until it reached the Strait of Malacca , a busy shipping lane west of the narrow nation some 250 miles from the plane's last known coordinates.
Military and government officials on Wednesday said American experts, and the manufacturer of the radar systems, were examining that data to confirm it showed the Boeing 777. Until then, they said the search would continue on both sides of the country, with an equal focus.
Dozens of ships and planes searching waters have failed to turn up anything, prompting officials to expand the hunt. Malaysia asked India to join the search for the missing jet in waters near the Andaman Sea -- far to the northwest of its last reported position.
"As of today, we have not found anything, but we are extending (the search) further," Hishammuddin said.
Search efforts continue for missing Boeing 777 more than a week after the flight vanished
CBS News correspondent Bob Orr says the U.S. government has offered wide-ranging assistance, including investigators from the FBI, FAA and National Transportation Safety Board.
On Wednesday, the NTSB said in a statement that its investigators, who have expertise in air-traffic control and radar, were providing technical assistance to Malaysian authorities. The investigators traveled to Kuala Lumpur during the weekend.
Air force chief Gen. Rodzali Daud said air defense radar showed an unidentified object at 2:15 a.m. about 200 miles northwest of Penang.
"I am not saying it's flight MH370. We are still corroborating this. It was an unidentifiable plot," he said.
It's unlikely the plane would have flown across Malaysia without being detected by civilian radar unless its electrical systems, including transponders allowing it to be identified by radar, were either knocked out or turned off.
There is confusion about whether military radar showed the plane veering hundreds of miles off course. CBS News' Bob Orr reports on the continuin...
Orr says veteran crash investigators have been confounded by the Malaysian military reports on the radar sighting.
If it did in fact change direction so dramatically to the southwest, the jet might have flown hundreds of miles off course without maintaining radio or data contact with controllers.
For that to be possible, experts say the plane must have either suffered an electrical failure that disabled the transponder which reports location, altitude, and speed, or somebody in the cockpit deliberately turned it off. Orr says that's why investigators cannot rule out hijacking or a criminal act by the flight crew at this stage.
Authorities in fact haven't ruled out any possible cause, including mechanical failure, pilot error, sabotage or terrorism. Both the Boeing 777 and Malaysia Airlines have excellent safety records. Until wreckage or debris is found and examined, it will be very hard to say what happened.
Malaysian authorities had contacted their Indian counterparts seeking help in searching areas near the Andaman Sea, India's ministry of external affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.
Hishammuddin praised India for joining the efforts and vowed to keep up the search until the plane was found.
Earlier, Gen. Rodzali released a statement denying remarks attributed to him in a local media report saying that military radar had confirmed that aircraft flew west over and made it to the Malacca strait. The Associated Press contacted a high-level military official, who confirmed the remarks.

Indonesia air force Col. Umar Fathur said the country had received official information from Malaysian authorities that the plane was above the South China Sea, about 12 miles from Kota Bharu, Malaysia, when it turned back toward the strait and then disappeared. That would place its last confirmed position closer to Malaysia than has previously been publicly disclosed.
Confusion over whether the plane had been spotted flying west has prompted speculation that different arms of the government have different opinions over where the plane is most likely to be, or even that authorities are holding back information.
Asked about this, Hishammuddin said his government had been transparent from the start.
"There is only confusion if you want to see confusion," he said.
Choi Tat Sang, a 74-year-old Malaysian man, said the family is still holding out hope that the plane and all on board are safe. His daughter in law, Goh Sock Lay, 45, is the chief stewardess on the flight. Her 14-year-old daughter, an only child, has been crying every day since the plane's disappearance.
"We are heartbroken. We are continuing to pray for her safety and for everyone on the flight," he said.
The mother of passenger Zou Jingsheng, who would only give her name as Zou, wept and spoke haltingly about her missing son while staying at a hotel near the Beijing airport. She expressed frustration with the airline and the Malaysian government over their handling of the case.
"I want to talk more, but all this is very stressful, and after all it is my son's life that I am concerned about. I just want to know where he is, and wish he is safe and alive," she said.

Search for Malaysian plane continues as frustrations grow
13/03/2014
SHARE:
(Vatican Radio) As the  search goes on for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 which disappeared             from radar screens five days ago tensions are rising as this aviation mystery continues             to make world headlines. Listen to Lydia O Kane s report
The spotlight is being shone squarely on the Malaysian government             for its handling of  Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 s disappearance.
There have             been accusations of conflicting information and a long delay in divulging details             of the military's tracking of what could have been the plane hundreds of miles off             course.
Families of those who were aboard the missing plane are also voicing their             frustration.
Government officials responding to the barrage of criticism say they             are coping as best they can with an exceptional, highly complex crisis, adding that             confusion, false leads, and misinformation are common in the initial hours of air             disasters in any country.
China too whose citizens make up around two-thirds of             the passengers is less than impressed with the progress and has urged Malaysia to             step up the search and investigation efforts.
China's Premier has pledged to continue             search efforts for the missing flight "as long as there is a glimmer of hope".
Chinese             authorities have released satellite images of three objects detected in the South             China sea, on the day the Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing.
Malaysian             officials are now asking experts at the US Federal Aviation Authority and National             Transportation Safety Board to help analyze data.
Michael Daniel from Aviation             Insight blog explains what expertise the FAA could bring:  "They have experts in interpreting             radar data, flight data and cockpit voice recording data."
The plane bound             for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur went missing last Friday an hour after take off with             239 people on board and its disappearance is turning into one of the world's most             baffling aviation mysteries.

Malaysian Missing Plane: Geography Students Urged To Help In Hunt For MH370 Aircraft
13/03/2014 12:08 | Updated 13 March 2014

Students at a UK university campus based in Malaysia have been urged to help hunt for the missing plane, which disappeared almost a week ago.
Geography students at the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC) have been given the opportunity to join in the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370.
Using the latest crowd-sourcing techniques for satellite image interpretation they will be able to join volunteers across the globe in the search for the missing aircraft.
Geospatial scientist Dr Tuong-Thuy Vu, a professor at the university, is an expert in disaster responses and crowd-sourcing.
HE says:  Earth Observation satellite platforms play an important role in every aspect of our life. They capture frequent and up to date images everywhere on Earth with the very latest synoptic views   up to 0.5 m resolution   of the Earth surface.
"In the area of emergency and post-disaster responses it is sometimes the sole data source when accessibility on the ground becomes impossible. As the search for flight MH370 enters its sixth day with ships, aircraft and helicopters, Earth observation satellite platforms have been deployed as another option. 
Dr Vu, who is working with international organisation DigitalGlobe to help search, has asked his students at UNMC if they will be willing to participate in the hunt.
The company is working with volunteers, who have been assigned a collection of satellite images to scour, in the hope of pinpointing any clues or wreckage.
Dr Vu adds:  I have looked at 40 tiles [images] so far, but no news yet. I also informed students today and asked if they want to participate. I also hope that satellite images of more extended area will be soon available.

Malaysian jetliner may have flown undetected for hours

KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia   Malaysian authorities expanded their search for the missing jetliner into the Andaman Sea and beyond on Thursday after saying it could have flown for several hours after its last contact with the ground.
That scenario would make finding the jetliner a vastly more difficult task, and raises the possibility that searchers are currently looking in the wrong place for the Boeing 777 and its 229 passengers and crew.
In the latest in a series of false leads, planes were sent Thursday to search an area where Chinese satellite images published on a Chinese government website reportedly showed three suspected floating objects off the southern tip of Vietnam.
They saw only ocean.
 There is nothing. We went there, there is nothing,  said acting Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein.
Compounding the frustration, he later said the Chinese Embassy had notified the government that the images were released by mistake and did not show any debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370.
The plane was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing early Saturday when it lost contact with ground controllers and civilian radar.
An international search effort is sweeping the South China Sea and also the Strait of Malacca because of unconfirmed military radar sightings that might indicate the plane changed course and headed west after its last contact.
The Wall Street Journal newspaper quoted U.S. investigators on Thursday as saying they suspected the plane remained in the air for about four hours after its last confirmed contact, citing data from the plane s engines that are automatically transmitted to the ground as part of a routine maintenance program.
Hishammuddin said the government had contacted Boeing and Rolls Royce, the engine manufacturer, and both said the last engine data was received at 1:07 a.m., around 23 minutes before the plane lost contact.
But asked if it were possible that the plane kept flying for several hours, Hishammuddin said:  Of course, we can t rule anything out. This is why we have extended the search. 
He said the search had been widened into the Andaman Sea and Malaysia was asking for radar data from neighbouring countries. India plans to deploy air and sea assets in the southern section of the sea, a senior official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Investigators have not ruled out any possible cause for the disappearance of the plane.
Experts say a massive failure knocking out its electrical systems, while unlikely, could explain why its transponders, which identify it to civilian radar systems and other planes nearby, were not working. Another possibility is that the pilot, or a passenger, likely one with some technical knowledge, switched off the transponders in the hope of flying undetected.
The jet had enough fuel to reach deep into the Indian Ocean.
Dozens of ships and aircraft from 12 nations have been searching the Gulf of Thailand and the strait, but no confirmed trace has been found. The search area has grown to 35,800 square miles (92,600 square kilometres), or about the size of Portugal.
Experts say that if the plane crashed into the ocean then some debris should be floating on the surface even if most of the jet is submerged. Past experience shows that finding the wreckage can take weeks or even longer, especially if the location of the plane is in doubt.
Malaysia s air force chief said Wednesday that an unidentified object appeared on military radar records about 200 miles (320 kilometres) northwest of Penang, Malaysia, and experts are analyzing the data in an attempt to determine whether the blip is the missing plane.

In China, family members ramp up pressure over missing plane
FULL COVERAGE:
By Natalie Thomas and Adam Rose | BEIJING, March 13
BEIJING, March 13 Furious relatives of passengers on a missing Malaysia aircraft are ramping up pressure on the Malaysian and Chinese governments to give them answers about what has happened, threatening lawsuits and demanding to see Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Surrounded by reporters who have flocked to the nondescript Beijing hotel where they have been told by the airline to gather, relatives are lashing out at the media, the airline and their own government for ignoring their plight.
"I really want to see President Xi - I don't know right now what could possibly be more important than the lives of these 200 people," said a young woman who gave her family name as Wen, fighting back tears.
"I also want to ask Mrs Xi, if your husband, President Xi, was on the plane, just imagine, if it was you, how would your parents feel?
"My husband was on the plane, every day my children are asking me about their dad, what am I supposed to do? ... We're helpless, we need our government to support us."
Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur early on Saturday and dropped off civilian radar screens less than an hour into its flight to Beijing, a mystery that has yet to be solved.
Another person, who declined to give his name, said a lawsuit was the only way forward.
"We are definitely going sue them. This is really bad. (We are not suing) Malaysia Airlines, but the Malaysian government," he told reporters.
One man from Beijing, speaking to reporters after a meeting between the families and Malaysian diplomats, said it was ridiculous the Malaysians seemed to have no information about even the most basic facts.
"The exact demands were the exact position the plane disappeared at, the time it disappeared, and what happened in the time between the time when the plane was first reported missing and 2.40," he said, recounting the meeting on Thursday with the diplomats, who left without speaking to reporters.
Malaysia Airlines, the Malaysian and Chinese governments say they are doing all they can for the relatives, though Beijing has demanded Kuala Lumpur drastically step up its efforts.
Hugh Dunleavy, Malaysia Airlines' commercial director, told Reuters on Wednesday they were having a problem with some people who were turning up at the hotel and claiming free meals and rooms when they had nothing to do with the flight.
"I'm trying to get that organised with the family members, to say, let's take a real look at this, because they're complaining that they don't want them in there," he said.
The loss of a relative threatens to cause real difficulty for some of the families left behind.
Feng Zhishan, 50, said his son Feng Dong, 22, was flying back to China via Kuala Lumpur from Singapore, where he had been working on building a new subway line.
"Our family has no money," Feng told Reuters. "They all said, you can make more money in Singapore."
Another man, who refused to give his name, said his cousin was on the flight, having transited in Kuala Lumpur on his way home from a business trip in Australia.
"He's a really outgoing guy, loves travelling and sports. He was just 27 this year, and with a six month old son," he said, visibly distressed.
"It's been more than 70 hours. By now their officials should have given us some kind of explanation."
Paul Yin, a U.S.-trained psychologist, said he was at the hotel to offer counselling services.
"They go through ups and downs every day. Some are even suicidal," he said.
"Chinese society is based on the family unit. Especially with the one-child policy, if your kids are gone... for many people their purpose in life is circled around the next generation, and if they're gone some people don't see a purpose in being around any more."

Missing Malaysia Airlines jet  may have flown on for four hours , say US investigators

Learning the lessons of ill-fated flight MH370
24 Jan 2017
US investigators suspect the missing Malaysia Airline passenger jet was in the air for four after its last confirmed contact, and may have been diverted to an unknown location, it was reported on Thursday.
Aviation investigators and national security officials are basing their theory on data automatically downloaded and relayed to the ground from the Boeing 777 s Rolls-Royce engines, which suggested the plane flew for a total of five hours, The Wall Street Journal reported. It attributed the details to two unidentified sources "familiar with the details".
The missing Malaysia Airlines jet sent two bursts of technical data back to Rolls-Royce, to the plane s engine maker s global engine health monitoring centre, before it vanished off the radar, the New Scientist reported on Thursday.
If confirmed, it could aid the protracted investigation looking for clues that might pinpoint the last known movements of the Boeing 777-200ER.
Flight MH370 sent data as it took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport, and subsequently during the plane s climbing phase.
 US counterterrorism officials are pursuing the possibility that a pilot or someone else on board the plane may have diverted it toward an undisclosed location after intentionally turning off the jetliner s transponders to avoid radar detection,  the WSJ reported, citing  one person tracking the probe .
The new information raises questions as to how far the aircraft may have travelled after losing contact with air traffic control officials, and whether anyone was in control of the plane, which had 239 people onboard.
Rolls-Royce said today it could not comment on the investigation.  We continue to monitor the situation and offer our support to Malaysia  Airlines,  the British engine maker said in a statement.
The manufacturer had on Sunday told the South China Morning Post that it tracks all of its engines and that if there had been a change in power it would know "first hand if there is something wrong with the engine". A spokeswoman said at the time any information they had would be passed to the airline and Malaysian authorities.
Flight MH370's last known position was recorded roughly halfway between Malaysia and Vietnam. Malaysian authorities earlier said that they had tracked what could have been the craft changing course and heading west.
The fresh suspicions come following the publication of pictures by China which appear to show large chunks of debris floating in the sea.
The pictures, posted on a Chinese government department's website, show three large objects in the South China Sea off the southern tip of Vietnam, near to where the flight was last tracked, Xinhua news agency reported.
The images, captured at around 11am on Sunday - more than 24 hours after the plane disappeared - appear to show "three suspected floating objects", the Xinhua report stated.
The largest was estimated to measure 24 metres by 22 metres, Xinhua said.
The images were originally posted on the website of China s State Administration of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense.
China's Premier Li Keqiang said today work was ongoing to try and identify the "suspicious spots" in the images.
However, the Vietnamese said today that two spotter planes sent to the area had failed to find anything.
It was hoped the images would provide investigators with the first real clue as to the fate of the plane, which disappeared after leaving Kuala Lumpur for Beijing in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Since then, the search has covered 92,600 square kilometers (35,800 square miles), first east and then west of Malaysia and even expanded toward India on Wednesday.
No other governments have confirmed the Xinhua report, which did not say when Chinese officials became aware of the images and associated them with the missing plane.
China's aviation chief Li Jiaxiang said Tuesday: "We have been waiting for a search result, but regrettably there has been no certain outcome yet.
"On one hand, we still have expectations, and sincerely hope that the missing flight can be found, but on the other hand, we have to be prepared for different scenarios.
"We'll never give up when there is a slice of hope."
He said China had made a number of suggestions in relation to the hunt, again urging Malaysia to step up the search and make the exchange of information smoother.
Malaysia s civil aviation chief, Datuk Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, said Malaysia had not been officially informed by China about the images, which he said he was learning about from the news.
He said if Beijing informs them of the coordinates, Malaysia will dispatch vessels and planes immediately.
"If we get confirmation, we will send something,  he said on Thursday morning.

Rogue jet not missing plane, Malaysian diplomat assures families
Frustrated relatives assured unidentified aircraft was not the missing plane

Learning the lessons of ill-fated flight MH370
24 Jan 2017
The Malaysian ambassador to China has received confirmation from the Malaysian military that it detected a rogue jet just an hour after flight MH370 vanished - but denied rumours it was shot down.
Iskandar Sarudin, confronted by the frustrated families of Chinese passengers, called up a military source to dispel rumours on social media that the aircraft was shot down - and that it could have been the Beijing-bound flight.
Sarudin was bombarded by questions from concerned relatives at a Malaysia Airlines briefing at Beijing's Lido Hotel.
Watch: Malaysia says hunt for jet not in disarray
The military confirmed spotting the unidentified aircraft on its radar about an hour and 20 minutes after MH370's signal went cold on Saturday, the ambassador said.
A Malaysia Airlines representative at the same briefing said the military had not determined if it was the missing plane.
The ambassador was quoted as saying the military official had said the rogue aircraft was not deemed a threat, otherwise it would have notified its response teams.
The press was barred from the briefing, but some Chinese correspondents managed to get accounts and pictures from the event. They posted these on their newspapers' microblogs.
The families also asked about the mental health of the pilots, Captain Zaharie Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. Shah had more than 18,300 hours of flight experience, while Hamid had 2,800 hours.
Malaysia Airlines said its investigation of the crew had not brought up anything unusual.
The airline representative also shed some light on the mystery of the continuing connection to some MH370 passengers' mobile phones. He said that at least two numbers could be reached and that the ringtones could be heard when dialled, but no one picked up.
But Malaysia Airlines said they had yet to confirm if the calls were actually connecting to the phones or if they were being redirected to telecom providers' servers.
Asked if the military radar had not been fully activated, the airline representative said the military could not track flight MH370's signal after it vanished from civil aviation radar.
Accounts described the meeting as tense. The aggrieved relatives stopped the officials proceeding to a media briefing until their questions were answered.

No sign of debris as US investigators suspect MH370 plane flew for hours
Search planes have found no sign of missing flight MH370 in an area where debris was reported. Meanwhile, a US newspaper report has said the plane may have stayed in the air for a total of five hours.

Clues missing as search continues
After officials said they found no signs of plane wreckage Thursday in an area where Chinese satellite images claimed to show "three suspected floating objects," Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said the images were released "by mistake and did not show any debris."
China reported the objects late Wednesday and said they were at a suspected crash site near the airplane s last confirmed location. The last contact was made halfway between Malaysia and Vietnam at 1:30 a.m. on Saturday, less than an hour after the Malaysia Airlines plane took off from Kuala Lumpur en route to Beijing with 239 people on board.
The search effort has been repeatedly dogged by false leads and conflicting information, drawing mounting criticism against Malaysian rescue officials.
Around two-thirds of the flight's passengers were Chinese, and China has been pressuring the Malaysian government to get to the bottom of the plane's disappearance. Premier Li Keqiang, speaking at a news conference in Beijing, demanded that the "relevant party" step up coordination.
On Wednesday, Malaysian authorities said they tracked what could have been the plane changing course and heading west but they remain uncertain about in which ocean to search for the plane.
MH370 'flew for hours'
US investigators suspect that the missing passenger jet stayed in the air for about four hours past the time it lost contact with air traffic controllers, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
The report said aviation investigators and national security officials had come to this conclusion based on "data automatically downloaded and sent to the ground" from the engines of the Boeing plane, which is part of routine maintenance programs.
The report raises the possibility that the missing Boeing 777 could have flown on for hundreds of additional miles. It also questions whether anyone was in control during that time and under what conditions.
However, the report has been denied by Malaysian officials. "Those reports are inaccurate," Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said Thursday. He said the aircraft's Rolls-Royce engines last transmitted data at 1:07 a.m.
"Rolls-Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS and investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised," he added.
Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines said Thursday it would retire the flight codes MH370 and MH371 "as a mark of respect" to the people on board its missing passenger jet.
"Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families of our colleagues and passengers of MH370," the national carrier said in a statement.

Malaysia denies report that jet flew on after contact lost

KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia on Thursday denied a media report that its missing airliner flew on for hours after last making contact, and said Chinese photos that raised hopes of a search breakthrough actually showed no wreckage.
"Those reports are inaccurate," Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said of a Wall Street Journal report that said US investigators suspected the plane had flown on.
The report said data automatically sent to the ground from the aircraft's Rolls-Royce engines suggested the Boeing 777 was in the air for four hours after its last contact with air traffic control at 1.30 am Malaysian time.
"The last transmission from the aircraft was at 01:07 hours which indicated that everything was normal," Hishammuddin said.
The Malaysia Airlines (MAS) jet was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on an overnight flight when it disappeared.
"Rolls-Royce and Boeing teams are here in Kuala Lumpur and have worked with MAS and investigation teams since Sunday. These issues have never been raised."
He also said China had told Malaysia that satellite photos released on the website of a Chinese state oceanic agency, apparently showing three large objects in a suspected crash site, were released "by mistake and did not show any debris."
A huge search effort has failed to find any evidence of the plane's fate despite scouring land and sea for six days.
It has been repeatedly dogged by false leads and conflicting information, drawing mounting accusations that Malaysia is bungling the response.
The effort involves dozens of vessels and aircraft from countries around Asia, plus the United States.
The Chinese agency's images had prompted Malaysia and Vietnam to dispatch planes to the area in question in the South China Sea to hunt for the suspect objects.
"The publication of the images on the website is an accident," Hishammuddin said, relating a statement he said he had received from China's ambassador to Malaysia.
He said the Chinese government did not endorse the action and was investigating.

It comes as the search for the missing plane enters its sixth day and now covers an area of a massive 27,000 square nautical miles in two separate areas   the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea.

Authorities are continuing to search in both areas   in the South China Sea where the plane dropped off civilian radar and where Chinese satellites picked up images of what appeared to be debris on the weekend   and in the Malacca Strait, where an unidentified aircraft was logged about 45 minutes later, at 2.15am, 200 miles northwest of Penang.
There have been sightings from people in both areas of what appeared to be a plane at the times MH370 is said to have disappeared.
An oil rig worker has also reported seeing what looked like a plane burning for 10 to 15 seconds from his oil rig, 300km southeast of the Vietnamese island of Vung Tau, in the area where the plane disappeared from civilian radar.
And at least six different groups of locals in the Kota Baru region, on the western side of Malaysia, near the Thai border, have reported seeing a low-flying aircraft between 1.30am and 1.45am on the morning of March 7. The reports come from fishermen, a farmer and a local security officer   all of whom have made police reports.
The search for missing Flight MH370 - with 42 ships and 39 aircraft - continues.Source:AFP
Police say they are taking all the reports seriously, especially as the fishermen are out in the ocean every night fishing and know well the different flight paths and what is normal and abnormal for aircraft flying overhead.
While the search, with 42 ships and 39 aircraft continues, a police task force is hunting down every detail they can find about all the passengers in a bid to identify anything suspicious.
They are studying video from the Kuala Lumpur airport and looking closely at the behaviour of all passengers and crew in the hours before they boarded the plane.
 We are looking very closely at the video footage taken on the whole of KLIA (the airport) from the seventh (March) until the plane takeoff. So we are studying the behavioural pattern of all the passengers,  Malaysia s police chief, Insp General Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said.
Colleagues have paid tribute to the chief pilot and have told that Capt Shah was so passionate about this job that he even had a homemade Boeing 777 simulator at his home which he would often use to help hone his skills.
And as a mark of respect to the passengers and crew of MH370, Malaysian Airlines has announced that the flight codes MH370 and MH371 will be retired from the Kuala Lumpur-Beijing routes.
From tomorrow the routes will be renamed MH318 and MH319.
 Our thoughts and prayers remain with the families of our colleagues and passengers of MH370,  Malaysian Airlines said in a statement

Missing Malaysia Airline Plane: What We Know Now

Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur and heading toward Beijing on the morning of March 8, but lost contact with air traffic control an hour later and disappeared off the radar.
No trace of the plane and the 239 people on board have been found and few details about what could have happened to the plane have been released.
Here's what we know now as of now about the investigation into missing flight MH370.
Check out ABC News' photos of the search for the flight here , too.
Flight MH370 departed Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, headed for Beijing, China, around 12:41 a.m. local time on Saturday. It showed up on radar two minutes later.
Malaysia's radar tracked flight MH370 until 1:20 a.m. when the flight dropped off the radar. At the time the plane was on its route over the South China Sea heading for the southern tip of Vietnam. An air traffic controller told the plane's captain he was about to be handed over to air traffic control out of Ho Chi Minh City. The pilot responded,  All right, good night.  Authorities initially said this was the last time they had contact with the flight.
Authorities have discovered that a flight showed up on the country's military defense radar at 2:15 a.m. local time in the Straits of Malacca, hundreds of miles due west of their last contact point and far from its route to Beijing. They said today that contact could possibly have been MH370.
The military radar also showed something make a turn back, meaning some aircraft reversing course, but they are not sure whether it was flight MH370. Because of the uncertain radar data, they are not sure of the plane's last position.
The engines on the plane, manufactured by Rolls Royce, are designed to send pulses of data at certain stages of the flight. Malaysian authorities said today they are working with Rolls Royce to determine what data MH370's engines sent before it went missing.
An oil rig worker stationed off the coast of Vietnam reported seeing a burning object fall into the ocean early Saturday, which could help show a fiery crash doomed the plane. The worker, a New Zealand resident, wrote an email to Vietnamese authorities explaining what he saw.
Vietnamese authorities said today they searched the area and did not see any evidence of a crash or debris.
Authorities in Malaysia said today they will "not reduce the tempo" and "not spare any effort" in searching for signs of the plane after five days without any hard evidence of what could have happened to Flight 370.
The search has been broadened to encompass 27,000 square nautical miles, an area roughly the size of Indiana.
Forty-two ships and 39 aircraft from 12 countries are scanning the area in the Straits of Malacca and South China Sea where the plane is last thought to have traveled.
Despite reports, there have been no plane parts or signs of passengers found.
Aviation experts say there are two possible causes of the disappearance: mechanical error or human error on board, which could include an electrical outage, a fire, a hijacking or bomb, and many other reasons. There is no hard evidence one way or another at his point, they say.
The transponders on board the plane that transmit signal's about the plane's location were somehow disabled or turned off, according to authorities. Investigators are looking at how and why they transponders were not functioning.
Authorities have not ruled out terrorism but have found no evidence of it.
Malaysian government officials today played a recording of the pilot's last recorded words for passengers' family members. The air traffic control worker said to the pilot, "We have to hand you over to Ho Chi Minh City," to which the pilot replied, "All right, goodnight."
Four passengers who were waiting on the stand-by list to board flight MH370 were given seats on the plane after four ticketed passengers did not show up for the flight.
239 people were on board the flight, made up of 227 passengers (including one infant and one toddler) and 12 crew members.
Three Americans, including two children, are among the missing. Philip Wood, 50, an IBM executive, had just come from Texas where he was visiting family on his way to Beijing.
Fourteen nationalities were on board, though 152 passengers were Chinese.
Twenty passengers on the plane worked for the Austin, Texas, company Freescale Semiconductor. Another passenger, Chng Mei Ling, worked as an engineer for the Pennsylvania company Flexsys America LP.
Pilot Zahari Ahmad Shah, 53, was a veteran pilot who joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and had over 18,000 flying hours.
Investigators discovered that two passengers used stolen passports, one from Austria and one from Italy, to board the flight.
Interpol identified the two as Iranians Seyed Mohammad Reza Delavar, 29, and Pouria Nourmohammadi, 18, and said they have no known links to militant groups, downplaying the possibility they were terrorists.

Malaysian plane still missing, all search futile
Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 with 239 passengers and crew on board vanished without a trace about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur early Saturday
The Malaysian air force Thursday morning sent an aircraft on an eight-hour search mission in areas around Subang, Penang, Phuket and the Andaman Sea, but found no trace of the Malaysia Airlines plane that went missing Saturday..0
The Malaysian air force Thursday morning sent an aircraft on an eight-hour search mission in areas around Subang, Penang, Phuket and the Andaman Sea, but found no trace of the Malaysia Airlines plane that went missing Saturday.
At 5 a.m., the C130 Orion transport aircraft took off from Subang air force airport maintaining a height of 760 metres and flew to the Andaman Sea, covering the area around Subang, Penang and Phuket. But nothing has been found, pilot of the mission said, Xinhua reported.
Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Tun Hussein said Thursday on his Twitter account that the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) also sent an aircraft to the South China Sea where Chinese satellites have reportedly captured images of floating objects.
"MMEA's Bombardier has already been dispatched to investigate claims of debris found by Chinese satellite imagery," Hussein said.
It was reported that the satellite images showed three suspected floating objects of various sizes, the largest one estimated to be roughly 22 metres by 24 metres in size.
Aircraft and vessels sent out by Vietnam Thursday, however, found no debris in the waters where Chinese satellites reportedly spotted the three objects, Vietnamese Deputy Transport Minister Pham Quy Tieu said, according to a report from Phu Quoc.
Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 with 239 passengers and crew on board vanished without a trace about an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur early Saturday. The Boeing 777-200ER was presumed to have crashed off the Vietnamese coast in the South China Sea.
The plane took off from Kuala Lumpur at 12.41 a.m. Saturday and was due to land in Beijing at 6.30 a.m. the same day. The 227 passengers on the flight included five Indians, 154 Chinese and 38 Malaysians.
Contact with the plane was lost along with its radar signal at 1.40 a.m. Saturday when it was flying over the Ho Chi Minh City air traffic control area in Vietnam.
Vietnam authorities dispatched two aircraft and two ships to the waters off the country's southern coast, said Pham, who is leading a frontline command in Phu Quoc island.
In addition, the Vietnam air force sent four aircraft to scour the land area in Vietnam's southern part. These comprised one seaplane, two AN-26 aircraft, and an Mi-171 helicopter.
However, these land area searches across the province of Kien Giang, located about 250 km from Ho Chi Minh City in the Mekong delta region, and U Minh Thuong national forest park yielded no clues, air force officials said.
In Beijing, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang said Thursday that China would not give up search for the missing passenger jet "as long as there is a glimmer of hope".
Li made the remarks at a press conference shortly after the conclusion of China's annual legislative session.
"We will not give up any suspected clue that is being found," he said. "We are also looking very closely at all suspected clues showing on satellite images."
Li said that the Chinese government has asked all engaged in the ongoing massive international search to enhance coordination to investigate the cause and to locate the missing plane.
Currently there are eight Chinese vessels in the area where the aircraft is suspected to have crashed, another one is on its way, and 10 satellites are being used to provide information and technological support, Li said.
The international search for the missing flight has so far involved at least 40 ships and nearly 40 aircraft from 12 countries.

The euro hit a new 2-1/2 year high against the dollar on Thursday as concerns over Chinese growth and political tensions in Ukraine took the fizz out of an attempted rebound in riskier assets, Reuters reports.
The euro reached USD 1.3967 and looked  set to test psychological resistance at a $1.40, in a possible sign that  the currency is regaining safe-haven status following the currency  bloc's prolonged sovereign debt crisis.
The  euro zone's economic recovery seems to be picking up steam even as the  European Central Bank resists pressure to ease policy further to counter  deflation risks.
"The  policy messages and data support the euro and we think that will allow  it to continue to push higher from here," said Ian Stannard, a  strategist at Morgan Stanley in London.
China's industrial output growth came  in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with  retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries that growth  could slow as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.
"The  China economy is slowing quite sharply, in our view... (although) the  lack of inflation and slowing growth does open the door for policy  easing," Gerard Lane, equity strategist at Shore Capital, said in a  note.
The European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.
"Markets  are nervous over China and Ukraine, with the latter weighing the most  because of the uncertainty of what will happen next and the seeming lack  of any coordinated or effective response," Titan Investment Partners  trader Darren Sinden said.

Wall St tumbles as Ukraine tensions rise, China slows
US stocks tumbled, with the Dow and the S&P 500 suffering their worst day since early February, on rising concerns over Ukraine and Russia and new signs of a slowdown in China.
Selling accelerated in afternoon trading after Russia launched military exercises near its border with Ukraine, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex its neighbor's Crimea region despite a stronger-than-expected push for sanctions from the EU and the United States.
In an unusually robust and emotionally worded speech, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.
The S&P 500 broke below its 10-day and 14-day moving averages, which were acting as short-term technical support levels. It also broke below the 1,850 level.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 231.19 points or 1.41 percent, to 16,108.89, the S&P 500 lost 21.86 points or 1.17 percent, to 1,846.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 62.912 points or 1.46 percent, to 4,260.42.
European stocks hit a five-week closing low as worries over economic growth in China and tension in Ukraine took their toll on market sentiment.
A broad sell-off among UK retailers, after a profit warning by supermarket Morrison's, also contributed to the downward momentum.
The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed down 1.1 percent at 1,293.35 points, its lowest close since February 6. The index has slipped more than 4 percent since late February.

Stock markets in Europe edged higher but remained pinned near one-month lows, with a 0.1 percent rise in the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 barely recouping any of the 1.1 percent drop in the previous session.

"This return to domestic bond auctions is the final stage of Ireland regaining full access to capital markets," said Sandra Holdsworth, an investment manager at Kames Capital.
"We expect Thursday's auction to pass successfully... However, one note of caution: at current levels of yield there is little margin to protect investors should the economic outlook worsen or fiscal discipline be lost."

London:
Concerns over China's growth and political tensions in Ukraine took the fizz out of an attempted rally in riskier assets on Thursday, as world shares steadied after their biggest falls for nearly two weeks.
Stock markets in Europe edged higher, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 up 0.2 per cent to recoup some of its 1.1 per cent drop in the previous session.
The move echoed trading in Asia, where MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan managed to rise 0.5 per cent, clawing back half the previous day's losses.
Soft Chinese data dented many markets, however, with Japan's Nikkei slipping 0.1 per cent, erasing gains made after Japanese machinery orders beat expectations, and South Korean shares also erasing most of its gains.

The MSCI All-Country World index edged up 0.1 per cent, not far from an eight-day low hit on Wednesday.
A major victim of concerns over China, copper dropped 0.9 per cent to $6,448 a tonne, a day after it hit a four-year low at $6376.25.
After a tumble in copper of around 8 per cent so far this month, investors are worried about a possible unravelling of Chinese loan deals using the metal as collateral.
Euro: a new safe haven?
Traditional safe-haven assets remained firm even as stocks steadied, as the diplomatic stalemate between Russia and the West over Ukraine continued.
The European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.
Gold hit a six-month high of $1,374.85, while US Treasuries have erased all the losses made following last week's strong payrolls data. The benchmark 10-year yield was 2.72 per cent on Thursday versus its six-week high of 2.82 per cent hit last Friday.

US crude futures steadied, although they remained near one-month lows hit on Wednesday after Washington announced a surprise plan for a test release of strategic oil reserves.
In the currency market, the Swiss franc hit a two-and-a-half year high of 0.8697 francs to the dollar, while the Japanese yen, which is under pressure from the Bank of Japan's loose monetary policy, also ticked up slightly.
The euro hit a new 2 1/2-year high of $1.3954, a possible sign that the currency is regaining safe-haven status as it recovers from the sovereign debt crisis.
Irish government bond yields hit new record lows before Dublin's first regular debt auction since its 2010 bailout, seen as a post-crisis watershed for the country.
Investors expected a solid auction result, which some said could be a catalyst for another leg in the Irish debt rally which has taken 10-year yields to just below 3 per cent from a peak of over 15 per cent in 2011.
"This return to domestic bond auctions is the final stage of Ireland regaining full access to capital markets," said Sandra Holdsworth, an investment manager at Kames Capital.
"We expect Thursday's auction to pass successfully... However, one note of caution: at current levels of yield there is little margin to protect investors should the economic outlook worsen or fiscal discipline be lost."

Europe shares close lower as Ukraine and China still dominate
Thursday, 13 Mar 2014 |  1:10  PM ET
CNBC.com
European stocks closed sharply lower on Thursday, continuing a volatile week that has been dominated by concerns over China's growth as well as the crisis in Ukraine.
UK supermarkets fall
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 Index provisionally closed lower by 1 percent as the referendum in Crimea on whether it should join Russia - a vote seen as illegal by Western powers - draws ever nearer with diplomatic efforts failing and economic sanctions becoming more likely.
European shares extended a two-week slide that began following the occupation of Crimea by Russian troops.
The U.K.'s FTSE 100 also closed down 1 percent -- lower for a fifth straight session -- following a slump in the supermarket sector. Britain's fourth-biggest grocer Wm Morrison posted its lowest profit in five years and slashed its expectations going forward. Morrison shares closed down around 12 percent, dragging other retailers with it, with J. Sainsbury trading lower by 8.4   percent and Tesco sinking 5 percent.

U.S. stocks also turned lower on Thursday, after the S&P 500 came less than four points from its record close, as Wall Street considered data that had retail sales rising last month and weekly jobless claims unexpectedly.
The Commerce Department reported retail sales gained 0.3 percent in February after a 0.6 percent decline the prior month, with the latter figure bigger than initially estimated.
Ukraine nearing referendum; Russian war games
Meanwhile, tensions in Ukraine continued on Thursday with a referendum for the region of Crimea still due to go ahead over the weekend. Leaders from Germany and Poland have said that the EU would go ahead with economic sanctions for Russia if the country decided to miss an arranged meeting which aims to de-escalate the situation.
Russia launched new military exercises near its border with Ukraine on Thursday, showing no sign of backing down in its plans to annex Crimea.
Ukraine's acting president Oleksander Turchinov said on Thursday that Russian forces were "ready to invade" but he believed international efforts could still end Moscow's "aggression."

German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- a leader closer to Valdimir Putin than most of her European counterparts -- warned of "catastrophe" unless Russia changes course.
"We would not only see it, also as neighbors of Russia, as a threat. And it would not only change the European Union's relationship with Russia," she said in a speech in parliament. "No, this would also cause massive damage to Russia, economically and politically."
Russia's MICEX index closed down by 2 percent on Thursday, continuing its slide south this week, having closed lower by 2.6 percent in the previous session.

European stocks hold steady in choppy trade; Dax up 0.04%

Investing.com -
Investing.com - European stocks were steady in choppy trade on Thursday, as the release of disappointing economic reports out of China dampened market sentiment and as the European Central Bank's latest policy move continued to weigh.
During European morning trade, the EURO STOXX 50 eased 0.06%, France's CAC 40 added 0.02%, while Germany's DAX 30 inched up 0.04%.
Investors remained cautious after data showed that Chinese industrial production rose 8.6% in the first two months of 2014, missing market expectations for an increase of 9.5%, while Chinese retail sales rose by a smaller-than-forecast 11.8% in the same period.
The data added to concerns over the strength of the world's second-largest economy.
Meanhile, European equities remained under pressure after the European Central Bank's decision last week to refrain from implementing policy measures to shore up growth in the euro area, despite forecasting low inflation for some years to come.
Speaking Wednesday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble said interest rates in the euro zone are too low from a German point of view. He also said he doesn't expect deflation to materialize in the euro zone.
Financial stocks were broadly lower, as French lenders BNP Paribas and Societe Generale fell 0.12% and 0.50%, while Germany's Deutsche Bank declined 0.72%.
Among peripheral lenders, Spanish banks Banco Santander and BBVA eased 0.06% and 0.21%. Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit overperformed however, rising 0.13% and 0.50% respectively.
Elsewhere, Bouygues shares were down 1.26% after the company raised the cash component of its offer for Vivendi's French phone unit SFR to  11.3 billion to top a competing bid from cable billionaire Patrick Drahi.
Adding to losses, Adecco SA dove 8.33% after its largest investor said it will sell about 16% in the provider of temporary workers.
In London, FTSE 100 dipped 0.05%, led by Morrison, down 9.10%, after the U.K. grocer said profit will plunge this year and pledged to sell  1 billion of property.
Meanwhile, financial stocks were mixed. Lloyds Banking slipped 0.29% and the Royal Bank of Scotland dropped 0.52%, while HSBC Holdings climbed 0.69% and Barclays jumped 1.08%.
On the upside, mining giants Glencore Xstrata and Randgold Resources rose 0.26% and 0.86% respectively, while rivals BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto advanced 0.56% and 1.41% respectively.
In the U.S., equity markets pointed to a higher open. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures pointed to a 0.10% gain, S&P 500 futures signaled a 0.14% rise, while the Nasdaq 100 futures indicated a 0.19% increase.
Later in the day, the U.S. was to release data on retail sales and import prices, in addition to the weekly government report on initial jobless claims.

GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares tick up cautiously but China growth fear weighs
* Asian shares rebound after big losses but gains cut after soft China data
* Concerns over Ukraine, China slowdown and copper rout sap risk appetite
* Gold hits 6-month high; euro, Swiss franc 2 1/2-year high vs dollar
* European shares likely to rise, DAX seen up 0.5 pct
By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO, March 13 Asian shares cautiously rebounded from two-week lows on Thursday but gains were pared after disappointing retail sales and factory output data underscored investors' concerns over slowdown in China.
A standoff in Ukraine and a massive fall in copper prices in recent weeks also spooked investors, although a flat close on Wall Street and some positive data in Australia and Japan helped to cushion the blow.
European shares are expected to recoup some of their heavy losses on Wednesday, with Germany's DAX seen as rising as much as 0.5 percent and France's CAC 0.4 percent.
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent, recouping a half of its losses the previous day, with Australian shares gaining on strong local employment data.
But soft Chinese data dented many markets, with Japan's Nikkei slipping 0.1 percent, erasing gains made after Japanese machinery orders beat expectations. South Korean shares <.KS11 >also erased most of its gains to end up 0.1 percent.
"What we're seeing today is a reaction to yesterday's sharp decline based on price (valuation) merits," said Hana Daetoo analyst Chang Hee-jong.
"But concerns about China remain the biggest issue for the market, and this will continue to affect markets throughout the first half of this year."
China's Jan-Feb industrial output growth came in below forecasts for the combined January/February period, with retail sales also weaker than expected, stoking worries growth could fall as Beijing pushes for economic reforms.
"Jan-Feb figures were disappointing, implying weaker growth momentum in China's economy. Probably a storm is coming," said     Gao Yuan, analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai.
A major victim of concerns over China, copper  dropped 0.4 percent to $6,508 a tonne, a day after it hit a four-year low at $6376.25 hit on Wednesday.
After a drop of around 7 percent so far this month, investors are worried about a possible unravelling of Chinese loan deals using copper as collateral, which could cause some investors more pains.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 reversed early losses and ended nearly flat, outperforming many others thanks in part to a string of positive data on the U.S. economy.
EURO AT 2 1/2 YEAR HIGH
The diplomatic stalemate between Russia and the West over Ukraine has also led investors to buy traditional safe haven assets as the European Union agreed on a framework on Wednesday for its first sanctions on Russia since the Cold War.
Gold hit a six-month high of $1374.85.
U.S. Treasuries have erased all their losses after last week's strong payrolls data, with the benchmark 10-year yield  at 2.73 percent versus its six-week high of 2.82 percent hit on Friday.
In the currency market, the Swiss franc hit a two-and-a-half year high of 0.87322 franc to the dollar, while the Japanese yen, which is under pressure from the Bank of Japan's easing, also ticked up slightly.
The euro also hit 2 1/2-year high of $1.3949, in a possible sign that the currency is regaining a safe haven status as it recovers from the sovereign debt crisis.
In a symbolic move, the Irish government returns to the market with its first regular debt auction on Thursday since it asked for an international bailout three years ago.
On the other hand, the New Zealand dollar hit a 10-month high of $0.8582 after the country's central bank raised rates as expected and pointed to further tightening ahead to curb inflationary pressures.
The action put the Reserve bank of New Zealand well ahead of major central banks in developed economies, who are still grappling with the aftermath of the financial crisis, helping the kiwi against a basket of currencies at a post-float high .
The Australian dollar also jumped 0.7 percent to $0.9045 after data showed an outsized increase in payrolls .
U.S. crude futures traded near one-month lows hit on Wednesday after Washington announced a surprise plan for a test release of strategic oil reserves, trading at $98.06 per barrel, near Wednesday's low of $97.55.
But the European benchmark Brent held relatively firm at $108.14 as it drew support from the unfolding crisis over Ukraine.

Six out of ten economic sectors ended in the red
U.S. stocks finished little changed on Wednesday, 12 March 2014 after erasing early losses that followed a selloff in Asian and European equities. Stocks began the day in the red, but spent the first two hours of action in a steady climb off their lows. The cautious start took place amid broad-based weakness across major European markets where Germany's DAX, Great Britain's FTSE, and France's CAC all posted losses close to 1.0% apiece.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11.24 points, or 0.1%, to close at 16,340.01, slipping for the third day in a row. The Nasdaq Composite gained 16.14 points, or 0.4%, to finish at 4,323.33, halting a four-session losing streak. The S&P 500 ended up 0.57 point, or less than 0.1%, at 1,868.20.
Six out of ten sectors ended in the red. Utilities and technology sectors fared best among the index's 10 sectors.
Traders also attributed the morning selling to worries about China's slowdown and Russia-Ukraine tensions, and they also emphasized a lack of new catalysts.
The Russian troop occupation of Ukraine is still a serious concern among traders and investors at mid-week. This coming weekend could be pivotal in this geopolitical crisis. A referendum from Crimean citizens on secession is scheduled for Sunday, and that could be the next flashpoint in the region. The Group of Seven nations was set to release a statement on Wednesday to reiterate its solidarity regarding opposing Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. economic data released Wednesday was again light and did not impact the markets. Economic data was limited to the weekly MBA Mortgage Index, which fell 2.1% to follow last week's increase of 9.4%
In other news on Wednesday, industrial production in the European Union fell by 0.2% in January, from December, and was up 2.1% year-on-year. The decline in EU output was unexpected and could have an influence on the European Central Bank's monetary policy. The ECB has been battling tepid EU economic growth and deflationary concerns with a very stimulative monetary policy.
Bullion prices ended substantially higher on Wednesday, 12 March 2014. Gold prices ended the U.S. day session with solid gains and hit a six-month high as more safe-haven buying and an increasingly bullish posture  prompted buying interest. Gold futures rallied on Wednesday to mark their highest settlement since September, buoyed by tensions in Ukraine and a pullback for the equities markets linked to concerns over a slowdown in China's economy.
Gold for April delivery rose another $23.80, or 1.8%, to settle at $1,370.50 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, its third-straight session climb. May silver jumped 54 cents, or 2.6%, to $21.36 an ounce.
Crude oil futures dropped 2% on Wednesday, 12 March 2014 at Nymex to finish below $98 a barrel following a jump in U.S. crude inventories that was nearly three times more than the market expected and a U.S. government announcement of plans for a test sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Concerns over the outlook for energy demand also continued to prevail in the wake of soft China data earlier in the week. April crude oil fell $2.04, or 2%, to settle at $97.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
In its weekly inventory report, the Energy Information Administration said crude stockpiles jumped 6.2 million barrels for the week ended 7 March 2014. Market was looking for a climb of 2.3 million barrels. The report also showed that gasoline supplies fell by 5.2 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles declined by 500,000 barrels. Gasoline stockpiles were expected to fall by 1.8 million barrels, while distillates, which include heating oil, were seen down 900,000 barrels. poll.
Comex copper futures prices hit a nearly four-year low on Wednesday, 12 March 2014. Part of the selling pressure on copper comes from concerns about weakening Chinese economic growth. China is the world's largest copper consumer. Copper is a major industrial metal worldwide.  Worries over China have also sent prices for copper sharply lower over the past three trading sessions, with prices holding below $3 a pound.
High-grade copper for May delivery closed up a penny, or 0.3%, at $2.96 a pound on Wednesday. Prices closed nearer the session high on tepid short covering after hitting a fresh contract and nearly four-year low early on. Weak economic data coming from China last weekend has helped to sink the copper market.
Participation was on the light side with 646 million shares changing hands at the NYSE floor.
Indian ADRs ended mixed on Wednesday. In the IT space, Infosys was down 6% at $56 and Wipro shed 0.88% at $13.4. In the banking space, ICICI Bank was up 1.4% at $41.5 and HDFC Bank rose 1% at $37.73.  In the other sectors, Tata Motors slipped 1.44% at $33.11 and Dr Reddy's Laboratories rose 0.9% at $44.78.
Tomorrow, weekly initial claims, February retail sales, and February import/export prices will be released at 8:30 ET while January business inventories will cross the wires at 10:00 ET.

Europe stocks mixed amid fears over China, Ukraine
March 11 2014 09:20 PM
A
A
In foreign exchange trading, the euro slid to $1.3862 yesterday from  $1.3875 late in New York the day before.
AFP/London
Europe s main stock markets closed mixed yesterday as traders assessed unease over China and Ukraine in the absence of major regional data releases, analysts said.
London s FTSE 100 ended the day with a slight 0.06% dip to 6,685.52 points.
The Dax 30 in Frankfurt gained 0.46% to 9,307.79 points but Paris s CAC 40 gave up 0.48% to 4,349.72 points compared with Monday s closing values.
Milan was up 0.39% after data confirming the Italian economy returned to growth in the fourth quarter last year after its longest post-war recession of more than two years.
 UK and European shares were predominately down today as global growth concerns and possible Crimean conflict linger in the background,  said Jasper Lawler, an analyst at CMC Markets.
Key forex dealers Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland slumped 2.42% and 3% respectively, ranking among London s poorest performers as allegations of foreign exchange rigging returned to focus Tuesday.
BoE governor Mark Carney told lawmakers that the case is  as serious as Libor, if not more so, because this goes to the heart of the integrity of markets and we have to establish the integrity of markets .
He also announced an overhaul of the central bank, saying a new deputy governor focusing on financial markets and banking will be appointed.
Global markets suffered a sell-off on Monday in response to a shock trade deficit in China that raised concerns about the economy, second-biggest in the world, while Japan revised down its growth for 2013.
US stocks pushed lower yesterday following a report showing a drop in small business sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.22% to stand at 16,381.85 points in midday trading.

The National Federation of Independent Business said its index of business confidence for February fell 2.7 points to 91.4, a reading associated with low growth.

In Ukraine, the country s Crimea peninsula yesterday voted for full independence ahead of a referendum to join Russia, while France threatened sanctions against Moscow as early as this week.
The latest escalation of Europe s worst crisis for decades came moments after Ukraine s ousted pro-Kremlin leader Viktor Yanukovych defiantly vowed to return to Kiev from Russia and declared he was still the leader of the ex-Soviet country.
 The possibility of a war is forcing dealers to remain on the sidelines,  said David Madden, market analyst at traders IG.
Meanwhile, emerging economies are expected to hold down global growth with their  sub-par  performance, the OECD forecast yesterday, warning that the risk of recent turmoil hitting developing markets could intensify.
But advanced economies are expected to post strengthening growth, although at a slower pace in the first half of 2014 than in the second half of last year.
The good news from the developed world is being offset by a slowdown in emerging economies, some of which have seen massive capital outflows as the US began to  taper  its $85bn-a-month stimulus programme.

Germany outpaces flat European shares
International | 11 March 2014
Francesco Canepa
London - German shares edged higher on Tuesday, outperforming mostly flat European stocks, as strong trade data from the region's largest economy revived investor appetite for the Dax index.
Broader market sentiment, however, was still undermined by a crisis in Ukraine, where confrontation between Kiev and Moscow showed no sign of easing.

Frankfurt's Dax blue-chip index, up 0.3 percent, bucked the trend after Germany reported seasonally adjusted exports and imports both rose more than forecast in January. The bounce was led by stocks exposed to the European economy, such as car maker VW and consumer-goods maker Henkel.
The Dax had fallen 2.9 percent in the previous two sessions, dragged down by worries about Ukraine and by disappointing Chinese trade data.
 The German trade figures were very solid and do point to a continuing recovery combined with an acceleration in growth in 2014,  said Markus Huber, a senior sales trader at Peregrine & Black.  Much will depend (on) how long the crisis in the Ukraine will drag on and if harmful sanctions and counter-sanctions will be put in place. 
Russia's moves to take over Crimea have led to plans for a referendum on March 16 on whether to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. Those plans have provoked condemnation from western countries and the threat of international sanctions against Russia.
The STOXX Europe 600 index of the region's top shares was flat at 331.30 points at 1157 GMT, keeping just above support at 330 points, corresponding to last week's low.
The STOXX was still facing resistance at 339 points, a six-year high set earlier this month, with buyers reluctant to push the index to fresh highs amid threats of a war in Europe.
 If I were talking to a trader, I'd say, 'Buy now and sell at (Monday's high of) 334 and a half, even though it's a really small gain' , said Valerie Gastaldy, the head of Paris-based technical trading firm, Day-By-Day.  This is a sideways market and I'd do as little trading as possible, because both upside and downside are limited. 
Gastaldy said the STOXX may fall as low as 320 points in the next few weeks and was waiting for the S&P 500, which had hit an all-time high on Friday, to resume its uptrend before buying back into European shares.
The narrower FTSEurofirst 300 was also flat at 1,320.37 points.
PORTUGAL LEADS RISERS
Among smaller bourses, Portugal's PSI index was the best performer, up 0.7 percent, led by lender Banco Comercial Portugues, on optimism about the debt-laden country's growth prospects.
Portugal's gross domestic product grew a revised 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the previous quarter as consumer demand rebounded and exports rose, data showed on Tuesday.
The release strengthened investor optimism that economies in southern Europe were starting to recover, as strong Italian data on Monday suggested.
The PSI has surged around 16 percent this year, leading a rally in southern European indexes. Italy's FTSE MIB has risen nearly 10 percent and Spain's Ibex roughly 3 percent.
While euro zone shares are now up 10 percent from their levels of three years ago, just before the euro zone debt crisis reached its peak, Portuguese stocks are still down 20 percent.
The MSCI Portugal index trades at a small discount to its euro zone peers, compared with a premium of up to 60 percent in 2009, Datastream data showed.
 Portugal has been recovering, and to some extent it has regained the confidence of financial markets,  said Wouter Sturkenboom, strategist at Russell Investments, who has a positive stance on peripheral European indexes
 At the same time, the problems Portugal is facing are still very real: it has extremely high debt levels and it's going to be extremely hard to deal with that debt without external support, so that's holding us back a little.

Samsung promoter LeBron James tweets phone crash, HTC suggests a brand change
 
Share on Facebook Tweet Share Share Email Reddit
It seems nothing is going Samsung's way; the company has now suffered a new endorsement let-down. This time basketball superstar LeBron James, who is usually seen promoting Samsung's Galaxy Note line-up, tweeted about his smartphone's malfunction which led to loss of his data.
The tweet by James read, "My phone just erased everything it has in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I've ever had in my life."
Considering that LeBron James is a Samsung brand ambassador in the US, and uses a company sponsored Galaxy Note 3, it was perhaps not the best idea to have tweeted the news out.
James, soon realising that the tweet might not be taken well by the South Korean manufacturer, pulled it down, but not before it had been seen by many of the basketball star's 12 million followers. Hours later, he followed up with, "Close call. Wheew! Got all my info back. Gamer! Lol."
Close call. Wheew! Got all my info back. Gamer! Lol
-- LeBron James (@KingJames) March 12, 2014
Unfortunately, the tweet did not shed much light on how James managed to get his data back.
A Samsung representative told TMZ Sports , "We are following the situation. We have a team looking into it. There should be more information soon."
HTC USA however, in no time jumped onto the situation, and said , "Maybe the world's best player needs the world's best smartphone."
Samsung's promotional efforts to pose celebrities next to its products have frequently been met embarrassing turns, such as recently, when Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted before, during and after the event from her iPhone, despite engaging in theatrical use of a Samsung product on stage .
However, the Ellen DeGeneres' celeb-studded selfie from the most-watched Oscars telecast in a decade became a landmark in the Twitter history and had been retweeted some 2.8 million times, shattering the previous record of 810,000 retweets for the photo of President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama hugging after the 2012 election.
Samsung has been charged with cases of a celebrity committing a faux pas as far as brand endorsements are concerned in the past. Samsung had in 2013 roped in Spanish tennis player David Ferrer to promote the Galaxy S4, who promptly sent a tweet praising the S Health feature - from an iPhone.

Samsung spokesman LeBron James tweets about his phone s meltdown
More
It can be pretty gut-wrenching to watch your smartphone delete all of its contents before your eyes   cloud or no cloud. So when LeBron James tweeted Wednesday "My phone just erased everything it had in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I've ever had in my life!!!" there was naturally some sympathy among his 12 million Twitter followers.
Samsung, on the other hand, couldn't have been pleased. After all, James is one of the brand's highest-paid spokespeople. He has become the veritable face of the Galaxy and Galaxy Note in an ongoing television campaign that touts the four-time MVP using his smartphones to do just about everything   from capturing precious family time to sneaking up on Chris "Birdman" Andersen in the training room for surprise selfies.
As one might imagine, the tweet was deleted minutes later, though not before it was seen by millions. Coincidentally, as of this moment, @KingJames does not appear to be one of the 298 Twitter users that @SamsungMobile is following.
Maybe LeBron could learn a thing or too from Shaquille O'Neal, who probably has an app for this kind of situation considering his $1,000 a week obsession.

Samsung is no stranger to having celebrity sponsorships backfire, usually in the form of the designated public person using an iPhone while endorsing one of the Korean company s handsets. Such wasn t the case with its latest sponsorship hiccup, though arguably it would have been better: LeBron James fired out a tweet complaining that his phone had deleted all of his data.
The tweet, which has since been deleted, read:  My phone just erased everything it had in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I ve ever had in my life!!!  Before being deleted, the tweet was retweeted hundreds of times.
Of course, James has been a long-running form of endorsement for Samsung, hawking its various devices in commercials and similar advertisements. Given his public association with the company s smartphones, the tweet is especially unfortunate.
Twitter is often the place where this sort of faux pas takes place. As we pointed out earlier this month , for example, Ellen s tweets at the 2014 Oscars show she was using her iPhone to snap pictures backstage, though she was officially using a Galaxy Note III, which was used to take the now famous celebrities selfie.

Oops!
Samsung spokesperson LeBron James just tweeted out that his phone   had a total meltdown and erased everything that was on it. 
"One of the sickest feelings I've ever had in my life!!!" said   LeBron. 
James has been a big Samsung endorser since it released the   Galaxy Note II, a giant phablet phone. He's been in numerous   commercials for Samsung. 
This is not exactly the sort of endorsement Samsung wants!
And James quickly realized his mistake. He deleted his tweet a   few minutes after posting. 
He tried a graceful recovery,   and sort of pulled it off:

LeBron James, Samsung rep, tweets rage at his Galaxy
LeBron James is so frustrated that his phone erased everything on it that he had to tell someone -- yes, all his Twitter followers.

When you get mad, you get mad.
When you're a famous person, it's your duty to share your madness. And if you want the immediacy of sharing just how mad you are, you go to Twitter.
Quite naturally, this is what LeBron James chose to do on Wednesday when his phone phlegmed out and erased everything he had on it.
As Business Insider reports , the Miami Heat forward told his 12 million followers: "My phone just erased everything it had in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I've had in my life!!!"
Oh, no(te). LeBron James/Twitter
Sympathy welled from Miami to Mogadishu. Sadly, some retweeted his pain and gloated.
For LeBron's phone is most definitely a Samsung. How can I know? Well, he's a highly-paid endorser of Samsung products . And he's said to use a Galaxy Note.
Of course, it could be that he is secretly an iPhone junkie. Some suggested that of Ellen DeGeneres during the Oscars. (And with reason .)
I cannot believe, however, that LeBron does anything other than commit his talents to one brand.
You will be stunned into dunking on your own head when I tell you that his tweet was subsequently deleted.
Moreover, just before game time of his team's home game against Brooklyn, James tweeted a happy ending : "Close call. Wheew! Got all my info back. Gamer! Lol."
Gamer, indeed. Lol, too.

When LeBron James tweets, Samsung listens ... especially when he's complaining about a HUGE problem with his cell phone -- since LBJ is a pitchman for the company. 
The drama began earlier today when 'Bron tweeted, "My phone just erased everything it has in it and rebooted. One of the sickest feelings I've ever had in my life."
We spoke to a rep for Samsung who essentially told us the company scrambled the jets to remedy the problem that blasted to LeBron's 12 MILLION followers. 
"We are following the situation," the rep tells us ... "We have a team looking into it. There should be more information soon."
LeBron, probably realizing he made a pretty huge boo boo, deleted the tweet ... and replaced it a short time later with some new info: "Close call. Wheew! Got all my info back. Gamer! Lol."

Samsung sure likes trotting out celebrities to help sell their products, but sometimes doing so leads to embarassment. In the most recent example, long-time Samsung ambassador and NBA superstar LeBron James recently tweeted  that his phone, presumably a Samsung Galaxy of some sort, had erased everything.
James, of course, deleted the tweet in question shortly thereafter because, let's face it, it's not a good look for James who has appeared in a number of Samsung commercials.
In a follow-up tweet, James is clearly not happy.

Price hikes at the pump hurt Merced wallets
Prices at the gas pump are spiking once again.
By Ana B. Ibarra - aibarra@mercedsunstar.com
Prices at the gas pump are spiking once again.
The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in Merced is $3.84, about 28 cents higher than last month s report, according to the latest AAA monthly statewide survey released Tuesday.
Merced s gas prices rank lower than the statewide average of $3.91, but higher than the national average of $3.49 per gallon. According to the survey, the national average is at its highest in nearly six months and has increased almost 25 cents in the span of 31 days.
AAA does not forecast the prices dropping anytime soon.
 While retail gas prices are climbing, oil analysts predict higher prices over the next month due to seasonal refinery maintenance and the required switchover to produce summer-blend gasoline,  Cynthia Harris, AAA Northern California spokeswoman, said in a news release.
 These factors coupled with unexpected market-moving events, such as unplanned domestic refinery maintenance or further escalation of geopolitical tensions with Russia, could cause prices to shoot up even higher,  according to the news release.
Residents have had to cut back on mileage or make changes to their travels and lifestyles to save money.
Merced resident Ray Peralta decided to switch his SUV for a smaller car in an effort to reduce his gas expense.  With $20 I wouldn t even fill up half a tank on my SUV, but in this smaller car $20 goes a long way,  he said.
Merced resident and Merced Community College student Zack Celestre drives a pickup, which fills up with about $70.
 It definitely makes going to school a bit more difficult,  Celestre said.  I don t get to visit my parents in Palmdale as much anymore because the trip there requires one full tank. 
However, Merced s average price is 23 cents lower than one year ago. The most expensive gas prices in Northern California are found in Eureka, where a gallon averages $3.98. Ukiah has the cheapest price, at $3.68.
To conserve gasoline, AAA recommends keeping tires at the proper pressure suggested by the vehicle manufacturer, performing routine maintenance and driving smoothly   avoiding sudden stops and starts.

Gas Prices in Sacramento Will Likely Reach $4
posted by KFBK News                          -
Gas prices have risen 26 cents over the past month -- the state average is $3.91 per gallon. So what's behind the price hikes?
As refineries prepare for the summer driving season, they do their maintenance, which slows down production.
And on the other side of that, they produce the summer blend gas -- a cleaner burning fuel.
"Cleaner burning gasoline does cost more to produce and that cost is being passed along," Patrick DeHaan with GasBuddy.com said. 
DeHaan says gas prices here will continue to climb over the next few months.
"Prices in Sacramento, which stand at $3.75, likely will continue to increase. They likely will get close to $4 or surpass $4," he said. 
However, he expects prices to top out around Memorial Day, and start to come down slightly throughout the summer.

Would exporting energy to Ukraine raise US gas prices?

Lawmakers in Washington say expanded energy exports could strengthen the U.S. hand overseas while at the same time shielding the economy from overseas shocks. How that affects U.S. consumers, however, depends largely on forces at home, AAA said Monday.
With Russian holding the energy cards in Eastern Europe , House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio ,  said  it was time for Washington to act. In a letter to Central European leaders, the speaker  said   President Barack Obama should sign off "immediately" on pending export requests for liquefied natural gas to help U.S. allies overseas.
At the IHS CERA Week energy conference in Houston last week, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski , ranking member of the Senate Energy Committee , struck the same chord for oil. She  said  reversing a ban on domestic crude oil exports could help establish the United States as the premier global superpower while creating more jobs at home. Adam Sieminski , director of the U.S. Energy Information Administration ,  said  he was "quite prepared" to review the issue, though how that affects the domestic market remains to be seen. (Related Article:  Coal s Comeback Year Runs into Trouble )

"On the other hand, exports would increase demand for domestic oil, which could push prices higher in the United States," he said. "Refineries in many parts of the United States currently have access to relatively inexpensive crude oil and could lose that cost advantage if policymakers allow expanded oil exports."
Green said Russia 's military response to the Ukrainian row overseas caused oil prices to spike last week.  By Monday, however, Brent crude was  trading  below the $108 per barrel mark, down by more than $1.00 amid disappointing economic data from China . The decline was limited because of simmering tensions over Ukraine , though unless there's some form of major response to Russia's actions overseas, petroleum prices should be relatively unaffected, the spokesman said. (Related Article:  Lingering U.S. Winter and Ukrainian War Could Spark Perfect Gasoline Storm )
AAA said Monday's national  average  price of $3.49 is only slightly higher than last week, but marked the 31st consecutive day of increases. South Carolina reported the lowest state average with $3.19 for a gallon of regular unleaded while California had the highest in the Lower 48 with $3.91.  This time last year, the national average price was $3.70 per gallon.
Green said the steady increase in gasoline prices is largely related to refinery maintenance and the shift to the summer blend of gasoline, which is more expensive to make. Daylight Saving Time means days are longer and warmer months are ahead, which could lead to an increase in demand as cabin fever breaks. The spokesman said there's not much volatility on the horizon, however, and "unless there are unexpected problems, it is likely that prices will peak at the lower end of our springtime forecast of $3.55-$3.75 per gallon."

Gas Price Spikes Today, What About Summer Prices
posted by Chuck LaTour, WOOD Radio news team                          -
3 years ago
share
If you can still find gas for around $3.50 a gallon, buy it. 
Pat DeHaan at Gas Buddy dot com says gas stations began raising the pump price for unleaded regular to 3-85 today, mainly because gas stations stopped earning a profit on gasoline.
"Now we are seeing stations hike that price back up really, because margin had been depleated from where they had been selling."
As is usually the case, DeHaan says today's price-spike shouldn't last too long.
"If you are stuck on E, I would try to wait or just buy what you need. We should start seeing prices start to come down into the weekend after today's hike."
With today's increase, many drivers may be wondering about future price spikes. Prices usually increase late spring / early summer. DeHaan says unless something unforseen happens, we should pay less this year compared to last.
"Last year, prices for the year peaked at $4.35 a gallon. This year, I see a peak price, if we even get over four dollars, anywhere from 20 to 30 cents under what we saw last year."

California gas prices top nationwide average
LOS ANGELES   (INT)   Gasoline prices in the Los Angeles-Long Beach area have hit $4 a gallon.  It s among the most expensive in the nation.
Only the San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles area is higher, according to the Auto Club s Fuel Gauge report.
Oil industry analyst Trilby Lundberg predicts a higher springtime run-up.
 Our demand for gas will build, seasonally, as it always does.  In April and May, we will see higher costs as the result of refiners  costs to produce lower vapor pressure gas to prevent summer smog. 
Inland Empire prices have risen 26-cents-a-gallon the past 4-weeks, but are still below a year ago.

Gas prices rising in Hampton Road and across the nation as spring nears
The average price per gallon increased 5 to 10 cents nationwide last week
March 11, 2014|By Cathy Grimes, cgrimes@dailypress.com
Like pollen in the air and lengthening days, rising gas prices are among the annual signals that spring is near.
The AAA Fuel Gauge Report released late Monday noted the national average price of a gallon of unleaded gas rose 3 cents, to $3.49, during the first week of March. During the last week of February, the average price per gallon rose 5-10 cents.
The bimonthly Lundberg Survey of gas stations across the nation also reported a surge in prices, with most rising about 10 cents during the first week of March.
The AAA report stated the organization "expects prices to peak between $3.55 and $3.75 per gallon over the next month."
Georjeane Blumling, spokeswoman for AAA of Tidewater, said several factors contribute to the boost in prices each spring. Those include refineries going off-line to switch to producing summer blend fuels and increased demand for fuel as motorists begin driving more at the end of winter. She said prices likely will rise slowly in March, then bump a bit the first week of April, when many school divisions schedule spring breaks.
Blumling expects prices to show "some volatility as we go into summer with an upward trend around July 4 and then a slide," she said.
The Fuel Gauge Report noted the national average peaked in 2011 on May 5 at $3.98 per gallon, while a year later, the peak was $3.94 per gallon on April 5. But last year, prices hit the top of their cycle on Feb. 27, rising to $3.79 per gallon before dropping, actually running counter to the usual price fluctuation cycle.
In Hampton Roads, the average price of a gallon of unleaded regular gas was $3.54 a year ago, 26 cents higher than the current average price, $3.28, according to AAA. In James City County, Newport News and Hampton, prices are close to that average, from $3.22 to $3.34 for a gallon of regular unleaded gas. Those prices do not include retailer discounts, which can lower the cost per gallon 10-30 cents.
Blumling said analysts have not predicted either a potential high price for 2014, or when the cost of gas may peak and then subside.
"How high is anybody's guess," she said.
Peninsula residents shared a range of reactions to the news that prices are on the rise.
Hampton Resident Christina Leach said, "I don't bother worrying except to find the best price, if possible, on my route."
Newport News resident Ashley Dethlefs-Shanks said her family uses gas discount programs to manage fuel costs. "Our favorite is the 10 cents off from Kroger for Shell," she said.
Angela Darouse Brown, of York County, plans trips with other people so they can share the cost of fuel. "If you worry about the gas prices, you will never leave the house," she said.
While analysts are not predicting a spike in prices over the next few months, Blumling said many factors can upset the cycle, ranging from hurricanes and other major weather events to oil spills and political instability. She noted that oil markets are closely watching developments in Ukraine, Venezuela and the Middle East.
"As we see unrest   depending on how it plays out, it could be dramatic," Blumling said.

Average retail gasoline prices in New York have risen 2.5 cents per gallon in the past week, averaging $3.74/g Monday, according to GasBuddy s daily survey of 6,118 gas outlets in New York. This compares with the national average that has increased 3.4 cents per gallon in the last week to $3.47/g, according to gasoline price website GasBuddy.com.
Including the change in gas prices in New York during the past week, prices yesterday were 19.7 cents per gallon lower than the same day one year ago and are 14.2 cents per gallon higher than a month ago. The national average has increased 18.5 cents per gallon during the last month and stands 19.1 cents per gallon lower than this day one year ago.
 Unsurprisingly, the surge in the national average has continued over the last week,  said GasBuddy.com Senior Petroleum Analyst Patrick DeHaan.  As refinery maintenance season is now in its prime, and will be for several weeks, motorists could see additional volatility at the pump should issues or unexpected problems arise with this period of maintenance. There tend to be glitches and issues restarting these plants, and the progressive switchover to various blends of gasoline complicates matters further. Then, as refineries get back online, the volatility will ebb, and prices will slow their climb- but all of that light at the end of the tunnel remains several weeks away,  DeHaan said.

LAS VEGAS -- Prices at the pump are continuing to increase.
Average retail gasoline prices in Las Vegas rose 4.8 cents per gallon in the past week, according to GasBuddy's daily survey of 649 gas outlets in Las Vegas.
The average for the area is $3.46 per gallon.
The national average increased 2.6 cents per gallon in the last week to $3.50, according to the website.
Including the change in gas prices in Las Vegas during the past week, prices Sunday were 31.9 cents per gallon lower than the same day last year but 17.0 cents higher than a month ago. The national average has increased 15.5 cents per gallon during the last month and stands 15.1 cents per gallon lower than one year ago.
"The national average has unsurprisingly continued it's march higher, and for the sixth consecutive week, motorists have faced rising gasoline prices," said Patrick DeHaan, a GasBuddy.com senior petroleum analyst. "While the rate that gasoline prices may slow nationally this week, I don't yet believe we've seen the peak in prices. Refineries are in the middle of one of their two major yearly maintenance seasons, which means as refineries wrap up their work in April, we could see restarting issues, which could bring the spikes in gasoline prices we're nearly accustom to seeing every spring," DeHaan said.
AAA last week said gas prices are following their usual trend of rising in the spring and heading toward a peak in the summer. Prices are expected to rise in the next month due to seasonal refinery maintenance and a mandatory switch to summer-blend gasoline.
Cynthia Harris, a Triple-A Nevada California spokesperson, said those. "factors coupled with unexpected market-moving events, such as unplanned domestic refinery maintenance or further escalation of geopolitical tensions with Russia, could cause prices to shoot up even higher." 
The highest average price of gas tracked by AAA in the nation is in Hawaii, where consumers are paying $4.16 per gallon of unleaded regular gasoline.

Year ago: $3.81
Outlook:
AAA Oregon/Idaho says Oregon is one of 15 states where prices have increased by at least a nickel in the last week. AAA expects the national average to peak between $3.55 and $3.75 per gallon in the coming weeks due to seasonal refinery maintenance and the May 1 required switchover for producing the more expensive but cleaner-burning summer-blend gasoline. The Oregon average is expected to have a slightly higher peak around $3.65 to $3.85. Any unexpected market-moving event, such as unplanned domestic refinery maintenance or further escalation of geopolitical tensions with Russia could cause prices to spike higher.
Last year the national average peaked at $3.79 on February 27, the earliest peak on record. In Oregon, the 2013 peak came on May 22 at $3.98 a gallon.

Gas prices on the rise

STATE PUMP PRICES SHOOT UP
AAA: California gas prices up 28 cents in one month
A surge in gas consumption, as California motorists hit the road early this year, has caused state fuel prices to rise significantly. Prices are following their typical yearly trend by moving up during the spring, peaking during the summer and decreasing through the fall. Today's prices are $0.28 cents higher than a month ago, according to the AAA Northern California monthly gas survey.
Northern California's average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline is $3.84, that's $0.26 cents more than last month's AAA report on Feb. 11. For perspective, gas prices today are $0.26 cheaper than California's average price on this date last year.
"While retail gas prices are climbing, oil analysts predict higher prices over the next month due to seasonal refinery maintenance and the required switchover to produce summer-blend gasoline," said Cynthia Harris, AAA Northern California spokesperson. "These factors coupled with unexpected market-moving events, such as unplanned domestic refinery maintenance or further escalation of geopolitical tensions with Russia, could cause prices to shoot up even higher."
Today's national average price at the pump is $3.49 per gallon   the highest price in nearly six months. This price is $0.03 higher than one week ago and $0.22 more than one month ago, however, national prices are still $0.21 per gallon less than the same date last year. The national average continues to climb steadily and has increased for 31 straight days, jumping almost a quarter during this span.
Rapidly escalating tensions in Ukraine pressured West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices to a more than six-month high last Monday. However, crude oil prices dropped during the week as the situation stabilized, resulting in a more than $3.00 per barrel drop by midweek. Market watchers will continue to monitor the Russian-Ukrainian conflict closely. The associated geopolitical tensions are likely to keep oil prices from falling too far.
Crude prices declined again today following bearish economic news from China over the weekend, rather than the easing tensions with Russia. China has the second largest economy in the world, so a weaker than expected Chinese economic report means a lower consumption of crude oil. This trend puts downward pressure on global crude prices. At the close of Tuesday's formal trading on the NYMEX, WTI crude was down $1.46 at $101.12 per barrel.
The least expensive average price in Northern California can be found in Ukiah where regular unleaded gasoline is $3.68 per gallon. Of all the metro areas tracked by AAA in Northern California, Eureka has the highest price at $3.98 per gallon of unleaded regular.

AAA Utah reported Tuesday that the current average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is $2.90   down 50 cents from last month.
All of the Utah cities tracked by AAA reported a double-digit increase since last month s gasoline report. The lowest average price   $3.31 for a gallon of regular gasoline   can be found in Logan, (while) Moab reported the highest average price at $3.52.
 Rolayne Fairclough, AAA Utah spokeswoman
SALT LAKE CITY   The cost to fill a gas tank is climbing again in the Beehive State.
The average price in Utah Tuesday was $3.35 per gallon for regular gasoline, about 4 cents higher than a week ago and 26 cents higher than last month. Currently, only 10 states have prices lower than Utah.
According to AAA Utah, the state s fuel prices are following a typical yearly trend by increasing as spring approaches. Even with a double-digit increase this past month, Utah s prices are relatively low when compared with the rest of the country, said AAA Utah spokeswoman Rolayne Fairclough.
Nationwide, the average price was $3.49 per gallon   up 18 cents over last month, but 21 cents lower than a year ago. Hawaii registered the highest average price at $4.16   the only state reporting prices over $4. In the lower 48 states, California was the high-price leader at $3.91 per gallon. Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee tied for the lowest average price in the country at $3.22 a gallon.
While prices in nearly every state moved higher in the past month, the majority of motorists are enjoying substantial year-over-year savings, Fairclough said.
"All of the Utah cities tracked by AAA reported a double-digit increase since last month s gasoline report," she said. "The lowest average price   $3.31 for a gallon of regular gasoline   can be found in Logan, (while) Moab reported the highest average price at $3.52."
She attributed the rapidly escalating tensions in Ukraine as one of the main factors in rising crude prices, which hit a greater than six-month high this month.
"The Russian-Ukrainian conflict and other geopolitical tensions are likely to keep oil prices from falling too far in the near future,  Fairclough said.

Gas prices up another four cents this week
Gasoline prices in Massachusetts are up four cents from last week, according to AAA Southern New England.
AAA s March 10 survey of prices in Massachusetts found self-serve, regular unleaded averaging $3.52 per gallon, up four cents from last week. Prices locally are 16 cents higher than a month ago. The current price is three cents higher than the national average for self serve unleaded of $3.49. A year ago at this time the Massachusetts average price was 17 cents higher at $3.69.
The range in prices in the latest AAA survey for unleaded regular is 28 cents, from a low of $3.41 to a high of $3.69. AAA advises motorists to shop around for the best prices in their area, and to make sure they and their passengers buckle up   every trip-every time.
This week's local gas prices and their ranges are as follows:

Gas prices surge as refineries conduct spring maintenance
2014-03-11T10:46:32Z
cokeefe@kfvs12.com
Springtime brings warmer days and spring flowers, but you might feel like your bank account has sprung a leak with the season also bringing higher prices at the gas pump.
AAA says this is the worst time of year to fill your tank. In spring, oil refineries switch from producing the so-called winter blend of gasoline to cleaner burning summer blends.
Many refineries cut production to do a little spring cleaning and conduct seasonal maintenance this time of year which can limit the supply and cause market uncertainty.
Drivers may have already noticed a higher bill this week to fill up their tanks. AAA says motorists in 20 states have seen prices at the pump jump by at least a nickel. Illinois and Wisconsin drivers have seen their price per gallon grow by more than a dime.
AAA expects gas prices to peak this spring at a national average of between $3.55 and $3.75 a gallon, barring any unexpected market-moving events. AAA warns increasing tension with Russia in Ukraine could constitute such an event should global oil supplies be impacted. Russia is the world s third largest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia and the United States.

Genghis Khan rose to power in Asia...with a little help from the weather gods
12 March 2014, 8:35 pm EDT By Alex Saltarin Tech Times
Aside from an indomitable army of horse-mounted warriors, Genghis Khan may have had a little help from the heavens. Scientists have found that climate change may have played a key part in the great Khan's victories.  ( Ludovic Hirlimann )

Genghis Khan is known as one of the greatest conquerors of all time. Aside from a massive army of fierce horse-mounted warriors, the Mongol emperor may have also had a little help from the heavens.
Before Genghis Khan came along, the fierce tribes of the Mongol steppe were plagued with constant tribal warfare. However, the warlord was able to consolidate the horse-mounted nomads into one of the most effective fighting forces the world has ever seen. In an unstoppable wave of horses and warriors, the unified Mongol tribes were able to carve a path of destruction culminating into one of the largest empires in history.
While Genghis Khan's leadership skills and strategic acumen have withstood the test of time, a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) shows that climate change may have played a key part in Mongol Empire's rise to power.
A team of scientists from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the West Virginia University have uncovered surprising evidence of a period of climate change that coincided with Genghis Khan's military exploits. By studying a cluster of stunted Siberian pine trees in Mongolia, the researchers were able to create a climate history dating back to a period of time when the Mongol tribes were involved in fierce infighting.
The ancient pine trees found in the Khangai Mountains were over 1,100 years old. In fact, some of the trees were still alive, having lived through the rise and fall of the Mongol Empire. By analyzing the tree rings on the trees, the researchers were able to determine that before the Mongol tribes were united, the entire region was under a harsh dry spell. This happened in the late 1100's, and the lack of resources caused by the draught may have fueled the constant conflict between Mongol tribes.
During long dry spells, tree's often exhibit stunted growth characterized by very thin tree rings. When rain and water is plentiful however, tree rings can be a lot thicker. The researchers found that the end of the drought coincided with Genghis Khan's empire building blitzkrieg. Analysis of the tree rings showed that a period of mild temperatures and heavy rainfall occurred between 1211 and 1225. This may have brought about a sudden increase in available resources for the Mongol horde.
"Before fossil fuels, grass and ingenuity were the fuels for the Mongols and the cultures around them, energy flows from the bottom of an ecosystem, up the ladder to human society," said Neil Pederson, a scientist specializing in tree-rings from Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. "Even today, many people in Mongolia live just like their ancestors did. But in the future, they may face serious conditions." Pederson is also the lead author of the study.
Richer grazing grounds nourished by heavy rainfall coupled with a mild climate suitable for raising livestock and horses were vital to the growth of the Mongol war machine. Considering that the average Mongol warrior at the time maintained around five horses, verdant grass lands may have indeed played a huge part in increasing the strength of Genghis Khan's fighting force.
"The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events," said Amy Hessl, an associate professor of geography from the West Virginia University and a co-author of the study. "It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. Where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower. Genghis was literally able to ride that wave." 
While the historical significance of the discovery may be invaluable to understanding the cultural, political and environmental factors involved in the rise of the Mongol Empire, the researchers' findings may also be useful in helping scientists gain a better understanding of how climate change can affect the world today.
"This last big drought is an example of what may happen in the future, not just in Mongolia but in a lot of inner Asia," said Pederson. "The heat is a double whammy-even if rainfall doesn't change, the landscape is going to get drier."
Mongolia has been experiencing a period of rapid climate change in recent decades. In as little as 40 years, temperatures in the region have risen by approximately 4.5 F.
In a sense, livestock have, up to now, served as the "fossil fuel" of Mongolia. Are there limits? "We're living in a pretty interesting time, when some of our own major sources of energy appear to be pretty tenuous. I think we can look to prior civilizations to see how they dealt with changes in energy availability. At any one time, there were winners, and there were losers,"  said Hessl.

Ghengis Khan s Rule Was Aided By A Warm, Wet Climate: Study
by editor
Brett Smith for redOrbit.com - Your Universe Online
The 13th century Mongolian conqueror Genghis Khan relied on hordes of Mongol warriors to expand his empire. Now, according to a new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , it has been determined that Genghis was also aided by the favorable effects of climate change .
In the report, a team of American and Mongolian scientists described how they used an analysis of tree rings to show that from 1211 to 1225 Mongolia experienced a period of relatively warmer and wetter weather   a stark contrast from previous decades that were marked by severe drought .
 The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,  said study author Amy Hessl , a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University.  It wasn t the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. 
The study team noted that a shift to a warmer and wetter climate would have boosted grass production on the Mongolian steppes. This increase in production would have helped the Mongols to raise the legions of horses they would later use to conquer most of Asia.
 Where it s arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower,  Hessl said.  Genghis was literally able to ride that wave. 
For the study, the team sampled tree rings from a clutch of Siberian pines that were rising from an old lava flow in the Khangai Mountains in Mongolia. The scientists took cross-sections from dead specimens and benignly extracted cores from living ones. They learned that some trees had lived for greater than 1,100 years and probably could survive for another millennium; even dead trunks remained largely intact for 1,000 years before rotting. One sample was found to have rings going back to about 650 BC. These annual rings change with temperature and rainfall, allowing the team to determine past weather by calibrating ring widths of living trees with information from 1959-2009, then comparing these with the cross-sections of much older trees.
The team found that the years preceding Genghis Khan s rule were marked by intense drought from 1180 to 1190. Then, from 1211 to 1225, Mongolia observed regular rainfall and mild warmth   which coincided with the rapid rise of Genghis Khan.
The researchers also found that after the Mongol empire expanded   the region s climate reverted back to its old pattern of dry, cold weather. The team added that many climate models show this part of Asia will be warming much faster than the rest of the world in the coming years   potentially reducing livestock and stifling the few crops on Mongolia s already scarce arable land.
 This last big drought is an example of what may happen in the future, not just in Mongolia but in a lot of inner Asia,  said study author Neil Pederson , a tree-ring scientist at Columbia University.  The heat is a double whammy even if rainfall doesn t change, the landscape is going to get drier.

Climate of Genghis Khan's ancient time extends long shadow over Asia of today
Posted By News On March 12, 2014 - 3:00pm
Tweet
Climate was very much on Genghis Khan's side as he expanded his Mongol Empire across northeastern Asia.
That link between Mongolia's climate and its human history echoes down the centuries, according to findings reported in this week's issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
But climate may no longer be the boon it was during the latter, wetter part of Genghis Khan's reign. The early years were marked by drought.
Mongolia's current drought conditions could have serious consequences for the Asia region's human and other inhabitants.
The discovery linking ancient and modern history hinges on wood. Trees provide an extensive climate record in their rings.
The tree rings' tales of ebbs and flows in water availability show that Genghis Khan took power during a severe drought, says Amy Hessl, a geographer at West Virginia University and co-author of the paper.

But, the scientists found, the rapid expansion of Genghis Khan's empire coincided with the wettest period in the region during the last millennium.
"Through a careful analysis of tree-ring records spanning eleven centuries, the researchers have provided valuable information about a period of great significance," says Tom Baerwald, a program director for the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program, which funded the research.
CNH is one of NSF's Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability (SEES) programs. CNH is supported by NSF's Directorates for Geosciences; Biological Sciences; and Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences.
"The results also provide insights into the complex interactions of climate, vegetation and human activity in semi-arid regions today," Baerwald says.
Though political realities would also have played into Genghis Khan's power grab, the regional climate at the time appears to have supported his empire's expansion.
The climate provided literal horsepower as armies and their horses fed off the fertile, rain-fed land.

"Such a strong and unified center would have required a concentration of resources that only higher productivity could have sustained, in a land in which extensive pastoral production does not normally provide surplus resources," the paper states.
While the ramifications for past history are significant, so, too, are they for today's.
The scientists believe that human-caused warming may have exacerbated the current drought in central Mongolia, similar to the drought that coincided with Genghis Khan's initial rise to power.
"If future warming overwhelms increased precipitation, episodic 'heat droughts' and their social, economic and political consequences will likely become more common in Mongolia and Inner Asia," according to the paper.

In the beginning of the 13th century, Genghis Khan conquered much of Asia and Eastern Europe, forming the largest contiguous land empire the world has ever known, spanning modern China, Korea, Russia, India, much of Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. He united warring tribes and became the great khan of the Mongol Empire   and nice weather might have helped him succeed.
In a new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, American climate researchers, who studied the rings of ancient trees in central Mongolia, say Genghis Khan s rise to power coincided with a bout of mild, wet weather . It turns out nice weather is great for empire building.
 When Genghis Khan was coming to power, Mongol tribes were fighting amongst each other. This coincidentally is a time of one of the worst droughts we see on record for the last 1,100 years,  explained Neil Pederson, a tree-ring scientist at Columbia University s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. He has spent the last two decades studying climate in Mongolia.
 Then as he is emerging and uniting the tribes, the weather turns positive.

Pederson and co-author Amy Hessel of West Virginia University found a group of ancient Siberian pine trees in central Mongolian lava fields, containing centuries of climate history tucked away in growth patterns. The scientists read the climate data like a history book, dating back over 1,100 years, and noticed a growth spurt in local fauna exactly at the time when Genghis Khan s 13th century empire began.
 A period of abundant moisture should translate into above average grass (productivity). When the trees are growing well, the grasslands are growing well, and that is translated into energy. You feel it all the way up the food chain,  Pederson said.
Nichola Di Cosmo, a professor of East Asian Studies at the Institute for Advanced Study, says that there are not many sources contemporary to Genghis Khan for historians to look back on.  The Secret History of the Mongols,  is a 13th century text written in Mongolian, probably based on the oral traditions passed down about the rise of Genghis Khan. It influences much of what we assume to be true about the conqueror and his armies. The climate data gave Di Cosmo new insight.

 There s quite a lot of research on correlations between climatic downturns and competition over resources,  Di Cosmo said.  So it looks like the situation in the end of the 12th century is pretty dire in Mongolia. At some point a new political order emerges. This happens when the climate is very favorable, strengthening the command structure created by Genghis Khan. 
Genghis Khan s military was dependent on horses and livestock. The rains and mild temperatures would have encouraged grass growth.
 Every warrior needed horses and a steady supply of military mounds, and obviously if the grassland is more productive it allows for more horses to graze and reproduce,  Di Cosmo said.
The natural abundance allowed the army to rebound quickly, centralize power and go on to conquer.
It wasn t all weather though.
 He was an exceptional leader, and we need to make sure people understand that,  said Pederson,  Just because the climate changed in a positive way, it doesn t mean that if there was a different leader that this would have happened.

Mild weather may have propelled Genghis Khan to power, study says

WASHINGTON   A pleasantly warm and wet spell in central Mongolia eight centuries ago may have propelled the rise of Genghis Khan, according to a U.S. study.
The research, released Monday, was based on an analysis of tree rings spanning 11 centuries, showing that the conqueror seized power during dry times and was able to expand his empire across Asia during an unusual stretch of good weather.
The years 1180-1190   before Genghis Khan s rule   were marked by severe drought, said the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
But as the empire spread from 1211-1225, Mongolia saw an unusual period of sustained rainfall and mild temperatures.
 The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,  said study co-author Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University.
 It wasn t the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. 
For the oldest samples, Hessl and lead author Neil Pederson, a tree-ring scientist at Columbia University s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, focused on an unusual cluster of trees they found while researching wildfires in Mongolia.
The strand of gnarled, stunted Siberian pines were emerging from cracks in an old solid-rock lava flow in the Khangai Mountains, according to a statement from Columbia.
Trees living in such conditions grow slowly and are particularly sensitive to changes in weather. As a result, they provided an abundance of data to study.
Genghis Khan died in 1227, but his descendants ruled most of what became modern Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, southeast Asia, India and the Middle East.

Study Attributes Genghis Khan s Rise to Climate Change
Submitted by Amandeep Dhaliwal on Wed, 03/12/2014 - 12:57
Climate change significantly helped Mongol warlord Genghis Khan to rise and expand, revealed a new US study of tree rings spanning 11 centuries.
Years before Genghis Khan began to rule, severe drought engulfed the area from 1180 to 1190. However, the picture changed completely from 1211 to 1225 as Mongolia witnessed an unusual period of sustained rainfall and mild temperature.
Earlier, Genghis Khan had to face tough time due to dry weather. But improvement in weather helped him spread his empire, said the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.
The grasslands of Mongolia steppes proved to be a great help for having horses, the greatest tool for war. Each Mongol warrior used to have five or more horses because they had enough food for horses in the area, which came from the grass of the steppes. Genghis was able to build the cavalry force in the world because of having appropriate supplies for horses. As a result, he outperformed any opposing militaries.
Also, human events began to occur because of the transition from extreme drought to enough moisture, said study co-author Amy Hessl, a tree-ring scientist at West Virginia University.
"It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power", added Hessl.
Analysis of an unusual clutch of trees found while researching wildfires in Mongolia helped Hessl and lead author Neil Pederson, a tree-ring scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, to find that it was climate change that was responsible for the conqueror's success.
Lives of some of the trees were more than 1,100 years and there was a piece of wood that had rings dating back to about 650BC.

In the early 1200s, Genghis Khan united the warring Mongolian tribes into a mobile, efficient military state. Lashing outward in all directions from their home on Central Asia's steppe, the Mongolian armies conquered a large swath of Central Asia in just a few decades. The empire continued to expand under Genghis Khan's descendants and, at its height, was one of the largest in human history, extending from Asia's Pacific coast to Central Europe.
The Great Khan is remembered as a politically savvy leader and a brilliant military tactician, but the rise of his empire, new research suggests, might have also had something to do with a stretch of unusually nice weather.
In 2010, American researchers Neil Pederson and Amy Hessl were in Mongolia's Khangai Mountains, studying the impact of climate change on the country's wildfires. As they drove past an old flow of now-solid lava left by a volcanic eruption thousands of years ago, they saw stands of stunted pine trees growing out of cracks in the lava.
Now, as any budding naturalist can tell you, the annual growth rings of many trees reflect the conditions they grew in. A long, wet growing season results in a wide ring, and a drought-stricken year means a thin ring. After you figure out the age of a tree, these growth patterns can provide a year-by-year record of what the local climate was like. Luckily for Pederson and Hessl, these patterns were written very clearly into the trunks of their Siberian pines, which were well-preserved by the cold, dry conditions of the steppe. The pair had potentially found a wooden record of climate conditions going back thousands of years.
Pederson and Hessl took samples from 17 of the trees and found that they were indeed very old. The innermost rings of some them dated all the way back to the 7th century. Since this discovery, they've gone back and sampled more than a hundred trees in the mountains and the Orkhon Valley region, where Genghis Khan established the seat of his growing empire.
Combining their tree-growth patterns with temperature reconstructions, Pederson, Hessl, and their team pieced together a picture of what the climate was like during the centuries that the Mongols conquered and ruled.
Just before Genghis Khan rose to power, Mongolia's climate was harsh, both physically and politically. The Mongolian tribes warred against each other, and the steppe was cold and stricken by drought. Amid the conflict, the researchers say, the worsening dry conditions of the land could have been an important factor in the collapse of the old order, and paved the way for centralized leadership under Genghis Khan. "What might have been a relatively minor crisis instead developed into decades of warfare and eventually produced a major transformation of Mongol politics," they write.
Then, in the early 13th century, as Genghis Khan unified the tribes, the droughts gave way to a period when the steppes were wetter and warmer than they'd ever been. "This period, characterized by 15 consecutive years of above average moisture in central Mongolia and coinciding with the rise of Genghis Khan, is unprecedented over the last 1,112 years," the researchers say. In addition to being wet, Mongolia at the time was warm, but not exceptionally hot.
In these conditions the Mongolian grasslands would have flourished, providing fuel for the Mongolian war machine. Each of Genghis Khan's mounted warriors used several horses, and the conquering armies brought herds of livestock with them for food and other resources. The dramatic shift in temperature and precipitation came at the perfect time to provide resources for rapid military mobilization and the Mongols' early expansion.
After the empire's initial spasms of growth, the tree ring and temperature data show a return to a cold, dry climate. By then, though, the Mongols had defeated several other Central Asian powers and could exploit the conquered regions instead of relying on the grass of the steppes and their local resources.
The climate shift certainly isn't the only driver of the empire's quick rise; it might have also just been coincidental, the researchers say. To flesh out the picture that the tree rings provide, the team is working on several other studies that could corroborate their ideas. Ecologist Hanqin Tian is developing models to connect the dots between the tree-ring records of weather and grass production. Biologist Avery Cook Shinneman will analyze the layers of fungal spores from animal dung that are trapped in sediment in Mongolian lakes, which could indicate the abundance of the Mongols' livestock. Meanwhile, historian Nicola Di Cosmo will comb through records from Asia and Europe looking for historical references to the climate and the strength of the Mongolian armies.
While the tree rings provide clues about the past climate and its possible influence on the rise of an empire, they also hint that another major shake-up is yet to come in Central Asia. As they did hundreds of years ago, conditions in the region have turned from wet to arid, with long, cold winters and drought-stricken summers comparable to those experienced just before Genghis Khan seized power. During the 2000s, livestock booms went bust; millions of animals died, and hundreds of thousands of displaced herders flocked to the city of Ulaanbaatar.
Those earlier droughts happened in a much cooler climate, though. Central Asia is currently warming more than the global average, and the combination of rising temperatures and droughts, the researchers warn, could mean another era of climate-spurred social and political upheaval.
